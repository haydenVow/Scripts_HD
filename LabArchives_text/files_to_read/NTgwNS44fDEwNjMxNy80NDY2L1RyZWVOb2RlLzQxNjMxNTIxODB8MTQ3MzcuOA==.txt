While it is hard to be prescriptive with what a report should contain, there
are a few common points that all reports should consider. A report should
(almost) replicate the "Discussion" section of a journal article. The
following is a ROUGH guide with a suggested paragraph structure. PLEASE ensure
to include references to previously published work (or links to work conducted
here at Vow).

  1. What is the most important overarching finding? 
  2. A brief discussion of all results and how they fit into our final goal of producing an edible meat product (this section might be several paragraphs long and should put the results into the context of what has been done before). 
  3. Any limitations of the study, why might our results not be correct? 
  4. What is the overall conclusion? 
  5. Discussion of future directions.

***PLEASE NOTE, YOUR REPORT SHOULD BE FINALISED WITHIN TWO WEEKS OF COMPLETING
ALL EXPERIMENTAL WORK.***  

  




Overarching finding: Dolly 12 fibroblasts died after 1 passage in 10C ACF
media

Discussion: we need ACF media to produce cultured meat on a large scale, and
this was an attempt to use our pre-existing ACF media that has been able to
support myoblast proliferation.

Limitations: N/A

Conclusion: Our current 10C ACF media formulation does not support fibroblast
adhesion or proliferation for more than 1 passage

Future Directions: We plan to test the effect of individual ingredients found
in 10C on fibroblast proliferation.  Due to recent cell death seen in 10C ACF
media in the past, we will explore different albumin sources to determine if
our current albumin is causing cell death.  Other additional reagents to test
include the effect of glyoxilic acid and the addition of adhesion factors such
as laminin, collagen, fibronectin, and vitronectin.  These adhesion factors
had promising effects on ACF adhesion to scaffolds in the past and may promote
adhesion for fibroblasts.
