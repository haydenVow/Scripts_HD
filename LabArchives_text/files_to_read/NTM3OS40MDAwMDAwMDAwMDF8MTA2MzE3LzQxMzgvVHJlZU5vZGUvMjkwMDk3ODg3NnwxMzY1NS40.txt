Process:

  1. Aliquoted 23 mL of growth medium and added growth factors as listed in table above. Placed in water bath 17:07
  2. Collected E125 from shaker, wiped with ethanol-sprayed Rediwipe, and brought into BSC 17:10
  3. Pipette suspension into 1 x 50 mL tubes. Kept E125 vessels in BSC, as culture will be returned to this vessel after feed. 
  4. Centrifuged at 300 x g for 5 min. 17:13 - 17:18  

  5. Aspirated  100% (30 mL) of supernatant, taking extra care to not disrupt or aspirate pellet. NOTE: 7 mL of supernatant goes back into E125, 23 mL can be discarded into waste. This is so we can do a 75% feed but still get an accurate cell count.
  6. Resuspended pellet in 200 uL of medium
  7. Took 1 x 10 uL sample for haemocytometer cell count.  
Cell count: 702,800

  8. Recorded count here https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-Z9HKM0xSq8-UX2C4876emMP7FCWLcpSqxwLkI-zypg/edit#gid=0
  9. Added  23 mL of fresh, warmed growth media to 50 mL tube
  10. Gently pipette-mixed cultures using serelogical, before moving cell suspension back to E125
  11. Returned E125 to incubator.   17:26
