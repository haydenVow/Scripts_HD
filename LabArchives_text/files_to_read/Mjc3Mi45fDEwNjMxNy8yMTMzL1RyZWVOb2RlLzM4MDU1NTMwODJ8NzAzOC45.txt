48-well plate  
7222-DOLLY12-Sheep P13-1of2  
  
7223-DOLLY12-Sheep P13-2of2  
Fibroblast ECM scaffolds seeded with MuSC  
  
Cell Free  
  
  




Process:

1\. Filled wells of new 48WP with inserts with 1 mL of E6 media growth media
(according to plate map). Moved plate to incubator. Timestamp: 10:34  

2\. Retrieved culture plate from incubator.

3\. Using sterile tweezers, moved scaffolds across to 48WP with inserts
containing fresh, warm media.

4\. Returned new plate to incubate at:

  * [x]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (aviary cells)

  

  * Incubator (Thermo #13), Lab [Main]

Results:

  * Results were;
    * [x]  As Usual (this is a repetitive task) - scaffolds look fine, do not appear to have disintegrated
    * [ ]  Unexpected because... 
    * [ ]  Need to be further analysed
    * [ ]  Other (.......)
