Flasks 9607, 9610, 9612, 9617 were not fed today as they were discarded
yesterday. Therefore we only needed 30mL per condition for feeding except CD
CHO control which was also used to feed xMen.




Process

  1. Placed media in water bath or incubator 
  2. Collected E125s from shaker, wiped with ethanol-sprayed Rediwipe, and brought into BSC
  3. Using a 25 mL serelogical pipette, gently pipette-mixed culture to break up cell clumps
  4. Transfer suspension into 50 mL tubes. Kept E125 vessels in BSC, as culture will be returned to these vessels after feed. 
  5. Centrifuged 50 mL tubes at 300 x g for 5 min. While cultures were centrifuging, rinsed each E125 with sterile dPBS. 
  6. Aspirated   15mL     of supernatant, taking extra care to not disrupt or aspirate pellet 
  7. Added   15mL    of fresh, warmed growth media to each 50 mL tube
  8. Took 100 uL samples from each culture and transferred to separate wells in a 96-WP, recording the location of each sample for future plate mapping 
  9. Gently pipette-mixed cultures using serological, before moving cell suspension back to E125s
  10. Returned E125s to incubator

Staining

Prepare reagents

Prepared dead stain solution in amber/black centrifuge tube:  
\- 2 mL dPBS  
\- 2 drops Nucgreen AF488 dead stain  
Vortex for 5 seconds to mix

Prepared Hoechst stain (50 ug/mL) solution in amber/black centrifuge tube:  
\- 4750 uL MilliQ  
\- 250 uL Hoechst Trihydrochloride trihydrate (1mg/mL)  
Vortex for 5 seconds to mix. Solution can be stored at 4°C for up to 6 months

Stain plates

  1. Added 100 uL dPBS into plate columns 3, 4, 9 and 10 using a multichannel pipette
  2. Added 100 uL of dead stain solution (dPBS+Sytox) to cells
  3. Stained samples with 20 uL of Hoechst stain solution
  4. Incubated for 30 minutes in the dark at room temperature 15:10 - 15:40
  5. Serially diluted cell suspension by transferring 100 uL cell suspension to subsequent wells, down to 25% dilution
  6. Centrifuged plates at 300 RCF for 1 minute 
  7. Prepared plate maps (all cells were run on the same plate)  
  
Plate 9604: images lost as this culture was deleted prior to imaging and so
images were not saved anywhere. Have tried to locate with engineering but no
luck.  




## Imaging

  1. Configure the Zaber session to image the entirety of each well; for 96 well plates this requires a 3 x 3 stitched image
  2. Take images of each well on the blue fluroescence ("DAPI") and green fluorescence ("AF488") channels




## Analysis

  1. Analyzed the blue- and green-channel images using the DAPI and AF488 MIA macros respectively.
  2. Downloaded and extracted the data then pasted it into the "MIA output" data workbook created in the "Staining" section.
  3. Copied the data from the "Final output" sheet of the "MIA output" data workbook to the "Master Cell Counting Sheet" of the "Suspension culture counting spreadsheet": https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1YuTvXJXQQMIMwRZGeqNjdi20WeURg5FpM-1TJ-zrb1c/edit?usp=sharing




Observations/Summary  
The cells for this experiment look extremely turbid in the flask. We were
concerned the cells were contaminated and therefore took extra precautions for
feeding including not feeding other flasks in the same hood to prevent cross
contamination. However we observed these cells under the microscope at high
magnification and there appears to be no signs of contamination. the cells
appear to simply be extremely confluent and aggregating significantly. The
cells appear much more confluent than when originally seeded. We will continue
to monitor the cells to see whether they are proliferating significantly. We
took images of the cells under the phase microscope before staining for
imaging. A couple of representative images have been provided below for
reference for day 4. Due to the high cell number, it is likely that the zaber
images will not be able to count the cells accurately. Therefore inspection by
eye may be more useful.
