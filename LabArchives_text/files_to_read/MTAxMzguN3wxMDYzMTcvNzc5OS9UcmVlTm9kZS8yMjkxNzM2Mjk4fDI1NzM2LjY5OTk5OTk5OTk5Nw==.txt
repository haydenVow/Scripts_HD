### Process:

1\. Took image of vessel with microscope on phase setting.

3\. Aliquotted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then
placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath for a minimum of 20 minutes
prior to use:

  1. TrypLE:    5     mL in    1     tubes
  2.  dPBS (for neutralising):     5    mL
  3.  dPBS (for washing):    5     mL
  4. Growth media (for seeding):   5  mL 

Time that all aliquots were placed in the water bath the warm before use
13:16 pm

Note: if aliquots were placed in water bath at different time, record the time
stamp for each individual solution.




4\. Removed vessel(s) from the incubator   13:36 pm

5\. Washed the vessel(s) with dPBS (warmed).

6\. Added   5  mL tryple to each vessel/well and incubated at 37˚C.

  1. Start/Finish for TrypLE was   13:39 pm 

7\. Neutralised with   5mL   dPBS and combined cell suspension into a   15mL
tube.

8\. Centrifuged at 650 x g for 5 min.

  1. Start/Finish time for centrifugation was   14:08 - 14:13 pm 




9\. Aspirated the supernatant(s).

10\. Resuspended pellet(s) in   5  mL   Growth    media   14:17 pm




11\. Transferred cell suspension into the  T25 flask .

12\. Transferred vessel(s) to incubate at: 14:20 pm  

  * 30ºC, 5% CO2 (reptilian cells)




Observations/Summary:

Due to low confluence of T75 flask, decision was made to move cells into 1 x
T25 flask to increase the cell density and encourage further proliferation. A
cell count was not taken in order to not sacrifice any cells at this early
stage of expansion.
