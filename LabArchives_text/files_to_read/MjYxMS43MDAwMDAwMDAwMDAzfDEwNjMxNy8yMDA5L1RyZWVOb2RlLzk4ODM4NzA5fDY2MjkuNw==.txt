## Feed performed by: Bonnie Tangey  




Growth Media:

  * [x] E8 + goodies
  * [x]  DMEM/F12 + 20% FBS + 1X P/S

  




Observations:

  
Cells in the ACF media (E8 + Goodies) were floating in the media or loosely
attached to the surface of the plate with a balled appearance. Cells in serum
containing media had a normal fibroblastic appearance, were adhered the the
culture vessel and were confluent.
