Process:

1\. Imaged top row (Row A) of both plates under 5X magnification.

2.Placed previously aliquotted media in water bath   9 : 23 - 10:24  

3\. Removed  100  % of supernatant from vessel.

4\. Replaced with  150 uL (per well/per vessel) of   Growth  media.

5\. Returned vessel to incubate at: 10:42

  * [X]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (aviary cells)

  

  * Incubator (Thermo ), Lab [Main/Library/Production]




### Observations/Summary:

 100 % media changed on vessel(s)

7105, 7106

  

Media looked yellow/orange in all wells before media change
