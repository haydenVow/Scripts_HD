Media/Reagents used:

NameDetails (reagent ID)  
4% PFA  
3108, 3109  
  
dPBS (non-sterile)  
5385  
  
PBST (0.2% Triton)

Process:

### Step 1: Fix samples

  1. Removed flask(s)/plate(s) `culture IDs # 7214, 7232, 7229, 7231  `from the incubator. 
  2. Removed media and washed wells with  4000 uL PBS.  
  3. Remove wash and wash once more with  4000 uL PBS. 
  4. Remove dPBS and add  2500 uL of 4% PFA and incubate at RT for 15 minutes. TIMESTAMP
  5. Remove the PFA and wash wells twice with  4000 ul dPBS.  
  6. Remove dPBS and replaced with fresh 4000 uL of dPBS 
  7. Proceed to primary antibody or store the plates at 4 degrees parafilmed until ready for immunostaining.

Fridge location/ID: 101




Observations/Summary:

Bioreactor was contaminated and all samples had to be discarded! All areas
were bleached and ethanol sprayed, dishes were disposed of in Biohazard waste.
Reactor and all parts were run through the dishwasher and autoclaved.

Control samples were imaged and looked great, dishes were fixed and stored in
fridge for further use

  




Results:

  * Results were;
    * [ ]  As Usual (this is a repetitive task)
    * [ x]  Unexpected because...contamination was not expected
    * [ ]  Need to be further analysed
    * [ ]  Other (.......)
