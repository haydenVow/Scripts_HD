Make a 'picklist' on a google sheet to record which wells are to be picked.

96 - 24-well expansion

  

24 - 6-well expansion

  

  

6-well to T25 flask expansion

  

T25 flask -> larger Surface area vessel expansion

  

Based on images collected on 29-July-2021

  

  1. Used a permanent marker to circle around the wells selected on the lid of the multi-well plates (so that when you are in the BSC you know which wells are to be selected)

Note* This protocol will talk about source wells and destination wells  
Source wells = the original well that the clonal population is in  
Destination wells = the location in the new plates where the clonal population
of cells will be seeded

Note* protocol proceeded in following order:

96 -> 24-well  
24 -> 6-well  
6 -> T25 flask  
T25 flask -> neutralise + count + seed into larger surface area.

  

1\. Aliquotted 88mL Growth Media (20mL to seed 4 x T25 flasks, 36mL to seed
into T75s if enough cells for 3 x clones, additional media for 50% Feed all
remaining clones that are not being passaged).  
Filled 7 x wells of 1 x 24-well plate and 3 x wells of 1 x 6-well plate with
Growth Media. Placed in incubator 13:10 pm

2\. Aliquotted 18mL Tryple in 1mM EDTA.

3\. Aliquotted 18mL dPBS (for washes)

4\. Aliquotted 4 x 2mL dPBS (for neutralising cells from 6-well plate) and 3 x
3mL dPBS (for neutralising cells from T25 flasks)

5\. Placed all aliquots in water bath at 37C, 5% CO2. 13:14 pm

96 -> 24-well

  1. Aspirate supernatant. 13:45 pm
  2. Wash each selected well with 100 uL dPBS.
  3. Add 50uL/well 1X Tryple to each well. Incubate at 37ºC for 15-25 min.    13:51  \- 14:10 pm
  4. Check regularly under the microscope to see if cells across all wells are detaching.
  5. When ~80% of all cells have detached in all wells, work well-by-well as follows:
    1. Neutralise each well with pre-warmed growth media (from the destination well)
    2. Mix cell suspension well and collect entire cell suspension (cells, tryple and neutralising growth media)
    3. Collect in a pipette and transfer into its designated destination well (the destinatinon well already contains growth media).
    4. Mix well to disperse the cells evenly throughout the well.
    5. Do not move the destination plate, allow the cells to attach.
  6. Transfer destination plate to incubate at 37ºC, 5% CO2.   14:16 pm

24 -> 6-well

  1. Aspirate supernatant. 13:52 pm
  2. Wash each selected well with 500 uL dPBS.
  3. Add 200uL/well 1X Tryple to each well. Incubate at 37ºC for 15-25 min.    13:54  \-  14:06 pm
  4. Check regularly under the microscope to see if cells across all wells are detaching.
  5. When ~80% of all cells have detached in all wells, work well-by-well as follows:
    1. Neutralise each well with pre-warmed growth media (from the destination well)
    2. Mix cell suspension well and collect entire cell suspension (cells, tryple and neutralising growth media)
    3. Collect in a pipette and transfer into its designated destination well (the destinatinon well already contains growth media).
    4. Mix well to disperse the cells evenly throughout the well.
    5. Do not move the destination plate, allow the cells to attach.
  6. Transfer destination plate to incubate at 37ºC, 5% CO2.   14:11 pm

  

6 ->T25 Flask  

  1. Aspirate supernatant.
  2. Wash each selected well with 2mL dPBS.
  3. Add 2mL/well 1X Tryple to each well. Incubate at 37ºC for 15-25 min.    13:59  \-  14 :14 pm
  4. Check regularly under the microscope to see if cells across all wells are detaching.
  5. When ~80% of all cells have detached in all wells, work well-by-well as follows:
    1. Neutralise each well with 2mL/well dPBS and collect cell suspensions from each well into 1 x 15mL tube.
    2. Centrifuge at 650 x g for 5 min at RT. 14:27 - 14:32 pm
    3. Aspirate supernatant
    4. Resuspend each pellet in 5mL warmed Growth Media
    5. Transfer 5mL of each clones' cell suspension to 1 x T25 flask each.
  6. Transfer destination plate to incubate at 37ºC, 5% CO2.   14:44 pm

  

T25 flask -> T75 Flask  

  1. Aspirate supernatant.
  2. Wash each selected well with 3mL dPBS.
  3. Add 3mL/well 1X Tryple to each well. Incubate at 37ºC for 15-25 min.    14:10  \- 14:22 pm
  4. Check regularly under the microscope to see if cells across all wells are detaching.
  5. When ~80% of all cells have detached in all wells, work well-by-well as follows:
    1. Neutralise each well with 2mL/well dPBS and collect cell suspensions from each well into 1 x 15mL tube.
    2. Centrifuge at 650 x g for 5 min at RT. 14:27 - 14:32 pm
    3. Aspirate supernatant
    4. Resuspend each pellet in 0.5mL
    5. Collect 10uL from each cell suspension, dilute with 10uL trypan blue and perform cell count on hemocytometer for each clone.
    6. 2F13 -> 1 x T175 (30mL)
