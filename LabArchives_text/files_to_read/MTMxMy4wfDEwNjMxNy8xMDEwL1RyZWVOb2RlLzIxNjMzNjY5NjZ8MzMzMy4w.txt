[Day 1] Revive DOLLY12 Fibroblast cells

Revive DOLLY12 F_WCB (1M cells) cells as per SOP_Thawing Cells Into Adherent
Culture V_02 into 1 x T175 flask (seeded at ~7,000 cells/cm2)

Growth Media = DMEM/F12 + 20% FBS + 1X P/S

*Note that these cells were revived as part of EPIC 17048 Conditions for optimal fibroblast aggregates

[Day 2] 50% Feed DOLLY12 fibroblast cells

Growth Media = DMEM/F12 + 20% FBS + 1X P/S

50% feed flask with warm growth media

[Day 3] Passage DOLLY12 Fibroblast cells, seed at 7,000 cells / cm2

Harvest cells as per SOP_Passaging Adherent Cells V_04, seeding at least 1x
T25 at ~7,000 cells/cm2. Harvest this T25 flask to sort at Garvan

*This T25 flask was seeded from remaining cells as part of the passage for EPIC17048 Conditions for optimal fibroblast aggregates

[Day 7] Fill 4x 384 well plates with Growth Media  

Growth Media = DMEM/F12 + 20% FBS + 1X P/S

*Fibroblast cells can adhere to growth surfaces without gelatin so no need to pre-coat 384 well plates.

[Day 7] Prepare DOLLY12 fibroblast cells for FACS sorting

Prepare 1 Styrofoam box to transfer to the Garvan Institute.

  1.  Box with the 4x pre-growth media-filled 384-well plates, parafilmed, an ice pack, Hoechst (ddH20), extra FACS Buffer (PRF DMEM/F12 + 2% FBS), tube containing cells, 4x parafilm sheets for sealing plates closed (4 need, 4 excess) and spare tubes for the operator. 
  2. Harvest cells from 1x T25 flask (passaged on Day 3) as per SOP_Passaging Adherent Cells V_04.

Once cell count is performed,

  1. Prepare at least 5 mL growth media (DMEM/F12 + 20% FBS + 1X P/S) and keep the media at 4ºC.
  2. Discard the supernatant carefully re-suspend the cells in 3 mL growth media (4ºC) inside a 15 mL tube, label the tube with "DOLLY12_F" and today's date
  3. Place the tube containing the cell suspension on ice for transport to the Garvan for FACS

[Day 7] Transport cells to Garvan, & FACS sort into 4 x 384-well plates.

Transport cells to Garvan Institute.

For FACS operator to do:

  1. Collect the entire 3 mL cell suspension in Growth Media (DMEM/F12 + 20% FBS + 1X P/S). Sample name = DOLLY12_F
  2. Add Hoechst (1:100) (30 µL) to the sample tube and mix well.
  3. Incubate at RT for 10 min.
  4. Centrifuge at 300 x g for 5 min at 4ºC.
  5. Aspirate supernatant. Add cold FACS Buffer (PRF DMEM/F12 + 2% FBS) to the pellet (without dislodging it).
  6. Centrifuge at 300 x g for 5 min at 4ºC.
  7. Aspirate supernatant carefully from the tube.
  8. Resuspend pellet in 1000µL FACS Buffer (PRF DMEM/F12 containing 2% FBS).
  9. Sort cells based on forward and side scatter and then PI- & Hoechst+ into individual wells of 4 x 384-well plates. (1 cell per well)
  10. After sort, parafilm plates and then close with lid. Parafilm the edges of the sealed plates.
  11. Centrifuge plates at 300 x g for 10 min at RT at the Garvan.
  12. *Keep plates incubating at 37ºC until transport back to VOW lab

[Day 7] Transport back to VOW HQ, Incubate at 37ºC.

Transport in a Styrofoam box WITHOUT an ice pack (remove ice pack so box is ~
RT) back to VOW HQ. Leave plates to incubate at 37ºC degrees, 5% CO2, in VOW
Top Binder (Library lab) incubator.
