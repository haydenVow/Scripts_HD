## Passage & seed E-Flask

1\. Cell counted cells from WCB E-Flask

2\. Prepared new medium (added growth factors) incubated at 37°C for 20
minutes

3\. Added new medium to E-250 and added cell suspension to final volume of
100mL. Seeded 50 000 cells/mL (total 5M cells)

`4. Transfered flask/plate(s) to incubate at: `

  * [x]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells) 17:13
  *  ~~[ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (aviary cells)~~
