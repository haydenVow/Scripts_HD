1\. Thaw 1 vial of DAISY and 1 vial of BUFFY fibroblasts  
Revive fibroblasts in DMEM/F12 + 10% FBS + 1x P/S following SOP_Thawing Cells
Into Adherent Culture V_02  
1955-Culture-4713-Vial-1of6: Brew, Tower 3, Box 2.

  1. Warm an aliquot of DMEM/F12 + 10% FBS + 1x PS- add to culture vessel and place in incubator (to equilibrate media pH before seeding) 
  2. Thaw frozen vial in water bath for 5 minutes or until defrosted
  3. Add 500ul of pre-warmed media to vial to reduce osmotic shock.
  4. Add cell suspension to culture vessels at approximately 7k cells/cm2. 
  5. Fibroblasts should be incubated at 37 degrees C.

2\. Perform a 50% feed of DOLLY12 fibroblasts 24h after thawing and then every
72h subsequently.

  * Warm an aliquot of DMEM/F12 + 10% FBS + 1x PS growth media to 37 degrees.
  * Take images of the cells & record them in your lab notebook
  * Perform a 50% feed of fibroblasts.
  * Fibroblasts should be incubated at 37 degrees.

3\. Passage DOLLY12 fibroblasts when they reach 100% confluence. Sub-culture
at 7k cells/cm2.

  1. Prepare growth media (DMEM/F12 + 10% FBS + 1x PS).
  2. Warm the appropriate amount of growth media
  3. Passage fibroblasts following SOP_Passaging Adherent Cells V_04. Plates should not be be gelatin coated as fibroblasts adhere to TC-treated plates without additional treatment. Fibroblasts frequently require 17-18 minutes of tryple to lift off of the flasks.
  4. Fibroblasts should be subcultured (i.e. seeded into new plates/flasks) at 7000 cells/cm2.
  5. Cells should be incubated at 37 degrees.

4\. When at least 4-5 T175 flasks are 100% confluent with fibroblasts, bank
the cells down at 500k per vial.

1\. Trypeliese fibroblasts following SOP_Passaging Adherent Cells V_04.
Fibroblasts frequently require 17-18 minutes of tryple to lift off of the
flasks, rather than the usual 15min.

2\. Perform a cell count.

3\. Bank the fibroblasts following the SOP for banking. Bank cells at 500k per
cryovial. Copy of Banking Template_V1
