Process:

1\. Placed the already aliquotted tubes containing 600uL of media in the water
bath  10:45-11:05

2\. Removed   100 % of supernatant from vessel (~500uL). Used a separate tip
for each well.

3\. Replaced with  0.5 mL of the respective growthmedia.

4\. Returned vessel to incubate at: 11:15
