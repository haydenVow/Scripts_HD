Aim/Purpose


To determine whether the Nuvonis cells can grow at the same rate with a 100x
reduced ACA concentration and/or no ACA.  


Hypothesis


We hypothesise that the Nuvonis cells will not be significantly impacted by
the reduction and/or removal of ACA in the medium, as they are already
suspension adapted.


Technical Gap


ACA is currently used at a 1:100 concentration with our Nuvonis suspension
cell line. This is based off the medium formulation provided for us from
Nuvonis. As we scale up to the 2kL bioreactor, ACA becomes a very expensive
ingredient at a 1:100 concentration. It is also difficult to procure large
quantities quickly. In this experiment we will test whether the cells are
impacted by a reduction to a 1:1000 concentration, and/or by the complete
removal of the ACA.


Method/Procedure


  1. Day 0 Make up 4 x media types:
    1. 50/50 RPMI/HyCell + no ACA
    2. 50/50 RPMI/HyCell + 1:1000 ACA
    3. 75/25 RPMI/HyCell + no ACA
    4. 75/25 RPMI/HyCell + 1:1000 ACA
  2. Day 0 Seed cells into above conditions as follows (cells are coming from continuous culture experiment):

75/25 RPMI/HyCell + no ACA  
  
75/25 RPMI/HyCell + 1:1000 ACA  
  
  3. Day 3 Perform 2 x cell counts of each flask and reduce seeding density to below 1M/mL if necessary. Note any observations, especially around cell clumping.  
  4. Day 4 Perform 2 x cell counts of each flask. Note any observations, especially around cell clumping. 
  5. Day 4 Calculate cell doubling times and compare performance of conditions
