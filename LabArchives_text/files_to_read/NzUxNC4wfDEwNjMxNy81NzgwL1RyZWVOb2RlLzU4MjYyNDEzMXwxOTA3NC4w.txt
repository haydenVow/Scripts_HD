### Process:

1\. Took image of vessel with microscope on phase setting.

1\. Aliquotted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then
placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath for a minimum of 20 minutes
prior to use:

  1. TrypLE:   5  mL
  2.  dPBS (for washing & neutralising):    10   mL 
  3. Growth media (for pellet resuspension):   1  mL 
  4. Growth media (for seeding):    30  mL 

Time that all aliquots were placed in the water bath the warm before use
11:00  

Note: if aliquots were placed in water bath at different time, record the time
stamp for each individual solution.




3\. Removed vessel(s) from the incubator  

4\. Washed the vessel(s) with dPBS (warmed).

5\. Added    5  mL tryple/well and incubated at 30˚C.

  1. Start/Finish for TrypLE was   11:16 - 11:27   

6\. Neutralised with    5 mL    dPBS/vessel and combined cell suspensions into
1 x 15 mL  tube

7\. Centrifuged at 650 x g for 5 min.

  1. Start/Finish time for centrifugation was   11:30 - 11:35   




9\. Aspirated the supernatant(s).

10\. Resuspended pellet(s) in   1  mL    growth    medium

11\. Aliquoted    10 uL  of resuspended cells into a microcentrifuge tube for
cell count.

12\. Performed a cell count using the haemocytometer and recorded the cell
count data in the Google Doc spreadsheet. Cell count: 2.6M  




12\. Transferred   1000  µL (total volume) of cell suspension to the pre-
warmed   60  mL Growth medium.

13\. Transferred cell suspension into the  2  x T175   vessel

14\. Transferred vessel(s) to incubate at:   :  

  * [ ]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (avian cells)
  * [x]  30ºC, 5% CO2 (reptilian cells)
