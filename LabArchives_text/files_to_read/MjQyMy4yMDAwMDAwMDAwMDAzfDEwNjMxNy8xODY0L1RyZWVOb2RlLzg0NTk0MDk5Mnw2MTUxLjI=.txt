Process:

1\. Aliquotted   30 mL  mL of  Growth Media into 70 mL   sterile container.
Placed in water bath 17:00

2\. Using a multichannel pipette, removed 100 % of supernatant from vessel.

3\. Using a multichannel pipette with four tips attached, replaced with  140
uL  (per well) of  growth   media. (Four tips can fit into the 70 mL sterile
container)

4\. Returned vessel to incubate at:

  * [x]  37ÂºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * Incubator (# 13 Thermo ), Lab [Main]
