Briefly

  1. Culture media was removed from each clone that appeared >90% Confluent 
  2. 1mL of dpBS was added to wash the cells 
  3. dPBS was removed and cells were then treated with 200uL of TRYPLE-EDTA
  4. Cells were incubated at 30 degrees for 10 minutes to detach cells
  5. Cells were removed from incubation, mixed by pipetting all of the Tryple volume was taken from each clone and added to a new fresh 6 well plate containing 3mL of DMEM/F12 + 20% FBS + 1xP/S growth media. 
  6. Cells were returned to incubate at 30 degrees, 5% CO2.
