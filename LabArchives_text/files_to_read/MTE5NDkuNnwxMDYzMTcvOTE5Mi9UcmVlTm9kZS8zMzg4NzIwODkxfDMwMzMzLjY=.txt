# Ranger Experiment ID: 820




# Aims:

  1. To compare manual (haemocytometer), ViCell XR and CellacaMX cell counts from many different live cultures and identify the variability of each method
  2. To determine if the CellacaMX can be trusted for routine cell counting in our lab and become the sole method for all cell counts at Vow (for R&D)




# Design/plan

6 or more cultures will be sampled to obtain cells for counting using three
different methods:

  1. Manual counts (Haemocytometer)
  2. ViCell XR
  3. CellacaMX

n=4 counts per culture ID, for all three methods. Live and dead cells will be
counted for each sample

Results will be calculated and reported for the comparison in cells/mL. Manual
counting calculations will be performed by taking the average count of
live/dead cells in 5 regions of the haemocytometer per sample and the formula
below:  
(AVG cell count) x (dilution factor) x (improved Nuebauer constant) = cells/mL

Calculations for the ViCell and CellacaMX are auto-calculated using the on-
board software and will be automatically uploaded into Ranger for each culture
ID.

# Results

Data from all count methods will be stored and analysed using the Google Sheet
below:

Raw data gathered from the automated cell counters was uploaded into Ranger
automatically and then downloaded as a single .CSV file. The data was then
transferred manually into the Google Sheet above for further analysis. A copy
of the raw .CSV file has been attached as a permanent record of the data prior
to analysis.
