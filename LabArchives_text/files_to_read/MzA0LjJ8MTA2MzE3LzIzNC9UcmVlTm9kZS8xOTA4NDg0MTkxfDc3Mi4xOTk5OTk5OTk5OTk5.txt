Growth Media:

  * DMEM/F12 + 20% FBS + 1X P/S + P38i (10uM)
  * E89C
  * E810C
  * E811B




### Process:

  1. Took image of vessel with microscope on phase setting.
  2. Aliquotted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath for a minimum of 20 minutes prior to use:
    1. TrypLE:    65     mL in      1x sterile container   
    2.  dPBS (for washing and neutralising):      65   mL in    1x sterile container    
    3. Growth media (for pellet resuspension):      1-2 mL of each growth media   in     4x 15 mL    tubes
  3. Time that all aliquots were placed in the water bath to warm before use    13 : 52  a/pm 
    1. Note: if aliquots were placed in water bath at different time, record the time stamp for each individual solution.




4\. Removed vessel(s) from the incubator     14:10   a/pm

5\. Washed the vessel(s) with dPBS (warmed).

6\. Added    10 ml for each T175 flask, 5 mL for each T75 flask     tryple to
each vessel/well and incubated at 37ËšC.

  1. Start/Finish for TrypLE was     14:35 - 15:05 (cells were difficult to detach even after wacking the flask)   

7\. Neutralised with     10 ml for each T175 flask, 5 mL for each T75 flask
dPBS and collected cell suspension into      4x tubes (1 per condition)    .

8\. Centrifuged at 650 x g for 5 min.

  1. Start/Finish time for centrifugation was    15 : 16 - 15:21  a/pm 




9\. Aspirated the supernatant(s).

10\. Resuspended pellet(s) in     2 mL for serum, 1 mL for ACF      media
time not recorded  a/pm

11\. Aliquoted      10uL    of resuspended cells into a microcentrifuge tube
for cell count.

12\. Performed a cell count using the haemocytometer and recorded the cell
count data in the Google Doc spreadsheet called 'Cell Count Spreadsheet' (see
link below):

SSIBtIylyrBQE5kRX5Z8NtI/edit#gid=0

  1.  Total cell number was: 
    1.   992 000 for serum
    2. 902 000 for E89C    
    3. 816 000 for E810C
    4. 872 000 for E811B    

  2. Volume of cell suspension required for subculture was: 
    1.  0.548mL/well for serum from the 2mL cell suspension  

    2.  0.301mL/well for E89C from the 1mL cell suspension
    3. 0.333 mL/well for E810C from the 1mL cell suspension
    4. 0.312 mL/well for E811B from the 1mL cell suspension
  3. Cell density per vessel:     90 666 cells/mL on 4.5mg/mL of microcarriers
