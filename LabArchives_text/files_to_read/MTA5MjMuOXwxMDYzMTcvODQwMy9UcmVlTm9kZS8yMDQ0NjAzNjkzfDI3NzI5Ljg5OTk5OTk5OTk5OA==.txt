12457-Nuvonis Quail Suspension341-P-1of1  
90/10 RPMI/CHO-in-1 + 1 mg/mL yeast + 0.02 mg/mL L-Ornithine monohydrochloride
& Putrescine dihydrochloride + 1 g/L poloxamer-188 + 0.0005 mg/mL IGF + 0.0001

Main lab, incubator 141  


Process
  
  
  1. Took 2 x 510 uL samples from each flask
  2. Performed cell count on ViCell. Recorded counts in table below.
  3. Removed 6M cells to seed 3 x E125 for max density experiment (link here) leaving 48,840,000 cells
  4. Aliquoted 80 mL of media and placed in incubator to warm 
  5. Topped up media to 200 mL to reduce density to 244.2K cells/mL 
  6. Replaced E125 in incubator at 37'C, 5% CO2, 120 RPM
