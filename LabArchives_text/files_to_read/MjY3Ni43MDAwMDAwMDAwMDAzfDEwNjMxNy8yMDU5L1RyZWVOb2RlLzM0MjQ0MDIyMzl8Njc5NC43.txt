RELATED TO MILESTONE:  Please provide the milestone that this EPIC is
progressing towards

AIM/PURPOSE: To determine whether FGF from Reprokine slows cell doublings
and/or causes cell death when used in E810C (as opposed to using FGF from
PeproTech).

HYPOTHESIS: Cells growing in E810C with FGF from PeproTech will have faster
doubling rates than cells in E810C with FGF from Reprokine.

RESULTS SUMMARY: Cells in both E810C media conditions (PeproTech and
Reprokine) appeared dead after 48 hours in ACF media.

Note: The TGFb used in this experiment was not reconstituted according to the
manufacturer's instructions which may have impacted results.

CONCLUSIONS: One of the ingredients in our ACF media may be causing cell death
due to its concentration or how it was reconstituted.

NEXT STEPS: Investigate all ACF media ingredients to check the brand,
catalogue number, reconstitution, and concentration. Compare these between
experiments where E810C performed well with experiments where it did not.
