PROCESS - cDNA synthesis

  1. RNA extracted samples made on 2-Mar-22 were taken from the -80 freezer and placed on ice
  2. An empty PCR plate was aquired 
  3. RNA and milli Q water were added to the PCR plate to equal a total amount of RNA 1000 ng/samples in 16 ul total solution according to the table above in the wells indicated. 
  4. To the samples labeled +ve, 4 uL of Vilo superscript was added to each well
  5. To the samples labeled -ve, 4 uL of milli Q water was added to each well
  6. Samples were placed in the thermocycler and run with the following conditions:

  * 25 c 10 min
  * 42 c 120 min
  * 85 c 5 min
  * 4 c hold

Process - qPCR

  1. The +ve cDNA samples made above were diluted 1:400 in new 1.5 mL tubes by added 798 uL milli Q water and 2 ul cDNA 
  2. Master mixes were prepared for the 4 genes of interest. Master mix 1x was as follows:
    * 5 ul sybr green master mix
    * 0.2 ul fwd primer
    * 0.2 ul rev primer
  3. 5.4 uL of MM was added to each well according to the map above
  4. 4.6 uL of diluted cDNA was added to each well according to the map above
  5. the samples were run of the ViiA7 qPCR machine with the following settings:
    * ViiA7 system
    * Comparative CT
    * SYBR
    * Standard 
    * 384 well plate
