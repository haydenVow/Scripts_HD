wash 1 - 11:28 - 11:33  
wash 2 - 11:35 - 11:40

  3.  Added   100 ÂµL PFA for 15 min: 11:43 - 11:58

Observations/Summary:  

### \- almost no cells or a few floating cells in the last three column
(B8-B10)

### \- cells appeared to peel off the culture surface after the washes with
PBS and PFA- see example images below. This was prevalent in most of the
culture (I swear I was being gentle Bonnie)
