## Performed by: Tom Tarento  




### Process:

Intermittent agitation to facilitate adhesion

  1. Transferred  2 x 9 mL  of cell suspension (passage entry here) containing `2 x 19.75 million cells` into  2 x 500 mL  of equilibrated microcarrier suspension in the culture vessel.

  1. Transferred vessel to incubate at:

  * [X]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (aviary cells)




Continuous shaking was commenced immediately at 90 RPM

  1.  ~~Began the seeding schedule for 6 hours (below) using the KASA app.~~
    1.  ~~The minimum required agitation speed for shaken cultures to maintain the microcarriers in suspension can be estimated using this calculator:https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/18NrC_xaJ2I87B4x3vTE46Z-ZUS3EV0Gw-CnM0DcukL4/edit?usp=sharing~~
      *  ~~Shake speed used =  
~~

    2.  ~~The seeding schedule may be reduced or extended by removing or adding 30 minute cycles as required. Generally, at least 3 but up to 12 hours are required to allow the maximum number of the inoculated cells to adhere.~~ ~~~~
