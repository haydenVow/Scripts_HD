Growth Medium: DMEM + 10% FBS + 1xP/S + 1:100 anti-clumping agent




Process:

  1. Aliquoted:
    1. 30 mL  of  DMEM + 10% FBS + 1xP/S + 1:100 ACA   
Placed in water bath: 10:25  

  2. Paused shakers by pressing the "play" button on the controller on the side wall of the incubator
  3. Collected culture vessel from shaker, wiped with ethanol-sprayed cloth and brought into BSC
  4. Using a 5 mL serelogical pipette, gently pipette-mixed culture for 1 minute to break up cell clumps
  5. Pipetted suspension though 70 um cell strainer into 2 x 50 mL tubes
  6. Centrifuged at 300 x g for 5 min. Timestamp: 10:55 - 11:00
  7. Aspirated 15 mL of supernatant, taking care to not disrupt or aspirate pellet 
  8. Re-suspended cultures using serelogical.
  9. Took 1 x 500 uL sample from 15 mL cell suspension and followed procedure in entry below to count cells.
  10. Replaced with 15 mL of fresh, warmed media
  11. Gently pipette-mixed cultures again before moving back to E125 flasks
  12. Returned vessel to incubator and replaced in clamp. Pressed "play" at side of incubators. Timestamp: 11:10

  * Incubator (#68), Lab [Main/Library/Production]



  1. Filtered 5 mL dPBS to remove any debris:
    1. Used 0.2 or 0.45 um pore size syringe filter
  2. Prepared stain buffer by combining:
    1. 1 mL filtered dPBS
    2. 1 drop (~50 uL) of NucBlue Live Cell Stain ReadyProbes Hoechst 33342
    3. 50 uL of Propidium Iodide 1 mg/mL solution
  3. Took 0.5 mL sample from culture 11:09
  4. Prepared 1 or more wells in a 96 well plate, each containing:
    1. 20 uL of sample from culture
    2. 80 uL of stain buffer
  5. Incubated culture in stain for 10-20 minutes (signal intensified as incubation time increased) at room temperature in the dark 11:18 - 11:36
  6. Centrifuged the 96 well plate at 650 RCF for 1 minute 11:37 - 11:42 (accidentally did 5 min)
  7. Took phase contrast, blue fluorescence and red fluorescence micrographs of each well
  8. Counted total cells (blue fluorescent nuclei, stained with Hoechst33342) and dead cells (red fluorescent nuclei, stained with propidium iodide)




Analyzed images from MIA:

  1. Opened MIA capture, opened relevant image record set and navigated to "Review"
  2. Selected image sets for download
  3. Clicked Analyze > Analyze with MIA
  4. Entered name and email, left "Analysis" drop-down field blank
  5. Clicked "Submit Job"
  6. Downloaded the zipped results file from MIA (attached below)
  7. Extracted the compressed images from the zipped results file  




Analyzed the blue fluorescence images in FIJI:

  1. Opened FIJI
  2. Navigated to Process > Batch > Macro
  3. Selected the Input folder (chose the folder containing the blue fluorescence images)
  4. Selected the Output folder (chose the same folder as the input)
  5. Pasted the text from the blue fluorescence macro into the text box
    1. 1x1 PI count is for single images
    2. 2x3 PI count is for stitched composite images of whole wells
  6. Clicked Process

### Observations/Summary:

 50 % media changed on vessel(s)

  1. 7342-NANDO3F-Chicken P3-1of1
  2. 7465-F_DOLLY12-Sheep P8-1of1  
  
Got decent Hoechst signal on DAPI channel but barely any PI signal on 555 nm
channel.
