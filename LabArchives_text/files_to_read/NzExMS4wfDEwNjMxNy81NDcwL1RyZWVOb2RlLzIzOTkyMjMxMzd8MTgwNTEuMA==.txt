RELATED TO MILESTONE:  KR1 - Build 3 new tools to increase maturation study
throughput by 2x

AIM/PURPOSE: To identify the difference in protein content between mature
myoblasts and TGF-b \+ Vit C treated fibroblasts. To identify a suitable total
protein assay (between BCA and Bradford)

HYPOTHESIS: Mature muscle cells yield higher total protein than TGF-b / Vit-C
treated fibroblasts. The BCA assay captures higher protein across all samples
due to its flexibility with protein-protein uniformity within the samples.

RESULTS SUMMARY:

While the BCA assay yields an overall lower total protein value, it also
exhibits better reproducibility (lower standard deviation: BCA = 5 ug,
Bradford = 9 ug). This may be due to an assay being more or less sensitive to
certain kinds of protein residues and workflow parameters such as washing
efficiency (to remove aforementioned proteins present in the media). Results
were also not normalized to cell density, which will affect the overall spread
of results.

Due to ongoing issues with cell loss, the comparison between fibroblasts and
myoblast/mature muscle total protein was not performed in this study.

CONCLUSIONS:

Both assays are suitable tool to measure total protein content of samples, but
a method must be developed to allow for normalization to cell density.

NEXT STEPS:

  * Repeat experiment to assess reproducibility and standard deviation caused by the workflow by obtaining lysates from cell suspensions to allow for protein values to be normalised against cell count numbers.
  * Quality control measures such as increasing the number of PBS washes (post-E6 removal) will be implemented and the effect on variability for each assay will be monitored.
