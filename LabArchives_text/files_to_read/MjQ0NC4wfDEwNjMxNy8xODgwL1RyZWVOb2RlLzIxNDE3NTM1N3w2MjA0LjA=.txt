## Performed by:




Reagent preparation:

1\. Aliquotted    mL  PBS for washing

2\. Centrifuged the secondary antibody stock using the benchtop
microcentrifuge for 10 seconds.

3\. Prepared Secondary Antibody mixes (pipette from the top/supernatant of
antibody solution):

If using AlexaFluor secondary antibodies then the max concentration should be
1:500 (typically used at 1:1000)

Pipette-mixed antibody mix and stored refrigerated away from light until
needed.

  

4\. Prepared DAPI mix:

   mL  PBS +    uL  of DAPI

Vortexed DAPI mix and stored refrigerated away from light until needed.

  

5\. Prepare the HRP stop solution by mixing acetic acid, TMB and 0.03% H202
with the volume ratio of 4:1:5.  (Chris thinks the bottle already has the H2O2
etc in the mix, but check!) Remove PBS+0.05%Tween20 and dispense the HRP
solution (enough to cover cells) and incubate the plate at in dark for 15 mins
(this will have to be kept constant going forward to be able to compare
samples and experim




Process:

1\. Removed plate from fridge (incubated in primary antibodies overnight).

2\. Washed 3 times for 5 min with PBS at RT.

3\. Incubated the cells with secondary antibody mixture in the dark at RT for
1 hour.  : - : a/pm

NOTE: from this step onwards protect from the light by wrapping plates in foil
and perform experiment in the dark.

1\.  Removed 2nd antibody solution.  : a/pm

2\.  Washed in 200uL PBS 5 x 5 min at RT in the dark. (No Triton)

DAPI staining: Only for MyoD + MF20 fluorescent side

2\.  Washed with DAPI (1:1000) in PBS for 5 min at RT in the dark.

5\. Confirmed staining on microscope by imaging.

  

  

Addition of TMB substrate: Only for MyoD ELISA and MF20 ELISA sections.  

4\. Started peroxidase reaction by adding 100uL of HRP stop solution (acetic
acid, TMB and 0.03% H202 with the volume ratio of 4:1:5) to respective wells
(see plate map) and incubating plate at RT for 15 mins.

 : - : a/pm

5\. Quenched reaction with 100uL of 0.5M HCl strictly after 15 minutes and
observed cyan to yellow colour change.

6\. Pipette mixed and transferred 100uL of the yellow supernatant to a new
non-treated 96 well plate.

7\. Placed plate in NanoStar plate reader and measured absorbance values at
450nm

  




  

  * Remove all remaining reagent and wash with PBS 3x to remove and neutralize the HCl.
  * continue using this original plate for Janus Green as well (on the same samples as ELISA)

Janus Green:

  1. Aspirated PBS from each well.
  2. Add 1X Janus Green Stain (0.3% solution in PBS) (#M4399) per well, sufficient to cover the cells (100uL in this case for a 96 well plate) and incubate at RT for 5 minutes:
    1. Start:   a/pm
  3. Remove dye, wash 5 times in deionized water (200uL each wash) or until excess dye is removed.
  4. Remove last water wash, add 100uL 0.5 M HCl and incubate for 10 min. : - : a/pm
  5. Transferred 50 uL of the stained supernatant into the wells of an untreated 96w plate and read absorbance at 605 nm using the NanoStar plate reader.
