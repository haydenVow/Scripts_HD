Process:

1\. Aliquotted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then
placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath for a minimum of 20 minutes
prior to use:

  1. TrypLE:    30   mL
  2. dPBS (for neutralising)      60 mL
  3. Nuvonis suspension base media (after adding 10ng/mL EGF, 50ng/mL IGF1, as well as 100ng/mL FGF2)     50  mL

Note: if aliquots were placed in water bath at different times, record the
time stamp for each individual solution.




2\. Washed the flask(s) with dPBS.

3\. Added   8mL    mL tryple to each vessel/well and incubated at 37˚C for
30    min, until >90% of cells dethatched (checked after 15 min and then every
5 minutes thereafter).

4\. Neutralised with    8mL   dPBS (warmed) and combined cell suspension into
a    50mL   tube.

5\. Centrifuged at 400 x g for 5 min




6\. Aspirated the supernatant(s)

7\. Resuspended pellet(s) in      6  mL    Nuvonis base   media.

8\. Performed a cell count using the haemocytometer and recorded the cell
count data in widget or the Google Doc spreadsheet called 'Cell Count
Spreadsheet' (see link below):

SSIBtIylyrBQE5kRX5Z8NtI/edit#gid=0

  




9\. Total cell number was:     8,532,000  

12\. Transferred    1.2mL of cell suspension to the pre-warmed   mL Growth
Media.

13\. Transfer cell suspension into (non-gelatin coated)         flasks/plates.

14\. Transfer flask/plate(s) to incubate at:

  * [ ]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (aviary cells)
