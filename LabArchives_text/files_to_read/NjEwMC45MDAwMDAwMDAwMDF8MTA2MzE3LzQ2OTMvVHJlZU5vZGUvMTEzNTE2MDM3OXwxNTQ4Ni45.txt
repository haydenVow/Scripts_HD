OR

PBST (0.2% Triton-X) :    160    (number of wells) x     100uL  (volume per
well) =   18 mL  

Blocking buffer:     160   (number of wells) x     100uL  (volume per well) =
18  mL  

Note: blocking buffer is: PBST (0.1% Triton-X + PBS) + 3% bovine serum albumin
(BSA). Kept in the fridge until needed in blocking step

  

Prepared Primary Antibody Mix: :  50µL   Primary #1 MyoG (Santa Cruz)   (1:200
) +  200 µL   Primary #2 MF20 (DSHB)   (1:50  ) +  9.75 mL Blocking Buffer

Pipette-mixed antibody mix and stored refrigerated away from light until
needed.

Process:

Permeabilise ( ~ 20 - 30 min)

1\. Removed PBS from each well.

2\. Added  100 µL PBST (0.2% Triton-X) to each well for 15 min:  12:05 - 12:29
pm

3\. Aspirated PBST for each well.




Blocking ( ~ 1 hr)

1\. Added  100µL of blocking buffer (3% BSA in PBST [0.1% Triton-X]) and
incubate for 45 minutes - 1hr at RT. (no more than 1 hour):

 12:33 - 13:18  8409

 12:38 - 13:22  8410

  12:41 - 13:27  8411

  12:44 - 13:30  8412




Single/Simultaneous Primary Antibody staining ( ~ 10 minutes or 2hr)

1\. Removed blocking buffer from each well.

2\. Incubated cells with primary antibody for 90min - 2hrs at RT, or 4ºC
overnight:   13:37 - overnight

3\. Parafilmed plates and stored at 4ºC in tissue culture lab Fridge.

After this step, all further task should be performed in a dark room. The
vessel should also be wrapped foil when not used.
