Aim/Purpose


To determine the effect of Hoechst in FACS sorting on cell selection, to
determine the effect of conditioned media on cells in 384-well plate and to
determine the required length of time before expansion into 96-well plates.


Hypothesis


That staining the cells with Hoechst either has a positive or negative effect
on cell selection during FACS (for favourable cells), and that conditioned
media will allow more cell colonies to proliferate from the starting point of
1 cell. We also hypothesise that this clonnig run will provide iinvaluable
information about the confluence that can be reached in a 384-well plate, and
indicate the most effective time to expand cells beyond 384-well stage.


Technical Gap


We have not had a successful cloning run using fibroblasts, possibly due to
low survival rates as fibroblasts generally need to be kept at a high
confluence. This experiment aims to test 2 conditions to see if they help cell
survival at early stages.


Method/Procedure


  1. [Experiment Plan]
  2. Revive F_DOLLY12 cells (Thursday 1st July)
  3. 50% Feed fibroblast cells (Friday 2nd July)
  4. FACS sort into 6 x 384-well plates
    1. Prepare 3 x plates with conditioned media + FGF
    2. Prepare 3 x plates with fresh media
    3. Prepare 20mL FACS Buffer
    4. Harvest cells from T175s
    5. Take to Garvan
    6. Hoechst stain 1/2 of sample, add buffer to unstained 1/2 of sample
    7. Sort Hoechst+ cells into top 1/2 rows of the plates
    8. Sort unstained cells into bottom 1/2 rows of the plates
    9. Centrifuge plates
    10. Transport plates back to Vowse, place in incubator
  5. Day 1 post-sort Zaber scan plates
  6. Day 2 post-sort Zaber scan plates
  7. Day 3 post-sort Zaber scan plates
  8. Day 7 post-sort Zaber scan plates
  9. Day 10 post-sort Zaber scan plates
  10. Day 11 Pick high confluence wells from 384-well to 96-well plates
  11. When confluent, Expand top clones from 96-well plate to 24-well plate
  12. When confluent, Expand top clones from 24-well plate to 6-well plate
  13. When confluent, Expand top clones from 6-well plate to T25 flasks
  14. When confluent, Expand top clones from T25 flasks to T75 flasks
  15. When confluent, Expand top clones from T75 flasks to T175 flasks
  16. When confluent, Expand top clones from T175 flasks to Multi-layered cell factory flasks
  17. Generate MCB_2 of successful clonal populations.
