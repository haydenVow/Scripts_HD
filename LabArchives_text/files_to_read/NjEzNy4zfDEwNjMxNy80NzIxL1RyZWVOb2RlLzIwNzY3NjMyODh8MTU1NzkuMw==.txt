### Issue

We have observed fluorescent debris on DAPI channel when performing suspension
feeds and counts on 2 occasions. As a result, we can't obtain any cell count
data obtained from these days. Restaining samples on the same day would
require a significant time of unplanned work. Because it has only occurred
occasionally and we haven't been able to identify the cause, it is difficult
to conclude what workflow changes need to occur to prevent this from happening
again.

### Dates observed in cultures

  * Monday 11th Oct DoE (EPIC24808)
  * Monday 11th Oct (EPIC24485)
  * Thursday 30th Sep (EPIC24485)

Well after staining, normal conditions (without debris)

### Potential causes

  * Something precipitating out of Hoechst dye
    * Interacting with Cytox stain
    * Interacting with dPBS
  * Non-sterile pipette tips
  * Debris in suspension cultures
  * Growth media reacting with staining solution
  * Sytox stain
  * Non-sterile PBS
  * Doing staining & dilutions in open/non-sterile environment

  

Because we've only seen this issue occur occasionally rather than every time,
the cause is unlikely to be due to the stains, PBS, or growth media reacting
together or precipitating. Instead, it is more likely from causes where debris
could be introduced randomly (for example from non-sterile equipment,
reagents, and environment).

This experiment will aim to isolate the cause of debris.
