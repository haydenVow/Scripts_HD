Aim/Purpose


To determine whether a supplementation of growth media with growth factors in
a step-wise approach can improve myoblast differentiation. The study will also
aim to compare gelatin coating and ECM gel coating to counter potential
delamination issues observed in previous myoblast differentiation studies
performed here at Vow.


Hypothesis


Phased differentiation will improve myoblast differentiation (assessed via
MyoG and MF20 staining) while maintaining cell viability.


Technical Gap


Vow has yet to develop an efficient and reproducible protocol for myoblast
differentiation.


Method/Procedure


Table 1. Method Overview

DayProcedure  
-2Gelatin/ECM gel coat 2x12-well plates and seed BUFFY (30,000 cells/well)  
-150% Feed with proliferation media (DMEM + 20% FBS + 1xP/S)  
0Commence phased differentiation for wells in column 1 and 2: 100% media
change to DMEM -ITS - Chir -Ldn. Daily media change until D3  
  
Commence current standard E6 differentiation for wells in column 3 and 4: 100%
media change to E6 media. Daily E6 media change until end of experiment  
  
3Phased diff: 100% media change to DMEM - ITS - Chir - Ldn - FGF  
  
Daily media change until D6  
6Phased differentiation: 100% media change to DMEM-KSR-Hgf-Igf-Fgf-Ldn Note:
expected substantial cell death. Daily media change to D8  
  
8Phased differentiation: 100% media change to DMEM-KSR-IGF. Daily media change
to D12  
12Phase differentiation: 100% media change to DMEM - KSR - HGF - IGF. Media
change every 2 days (double amount of media to avoid weekend feeds)  
12-onwards Continue media changes and observe for myotube formation  
~20 Analysis:  
1\. 3 wells each treatment for total protein measurement via Bradford assay  
2\. 3 wells each treatment for MyoG and MF20  immunostaining
