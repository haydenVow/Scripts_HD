Process:

1\. Aliquotted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then
placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath for a minimum of 20 minutes
prior to use:

  1. TrypLE:    20   mL in   1x 50 mL    tubes
  2. dPBS (for neutralising)    40   mL in    1x 50 mL    tubes
  3. Growth media (for pellet resuspension):    3   mL in    1x 15 mL    tubes
  4. Times that all aliquots were placed in the water bath to warm before use  12:27 

Note: if aliquots were placed in water bath at different times, record the
time stamp for each individual solution.




2\. Washed the flask(s) with dPBS.

3\. Added    10   mL tryple to each vessel/well and incubated at 37ËšC for
10    min.

Note: Fibroblasts typically require 15-18 minutes of incubation with tryple,
slightly longer than MuSCs.

  1. Start/Finish time for centrifugation was  12:42    \-    12:52   

4\. Neutralised with    20 mL   dPBS (warmed) and combined cell suspension
into a    1x 50 mL   tube.

5\. Centrifuged at 650 x g for 5 min

  1. Start/Finish time for centrifugation was   12:55    \-    13:00 




6\. Aspirated the supernatant(s)

7\. Resuspended pellet(s) in      2  mL    Growth   media.

8\. Performed a cell count using the haemocytometer and recorded the cell
count data in widget or the Google Doc spreadsheet called 'Cell Count
Spreadsheet' (see link below):

SSIBtIylyrBQE5kRX5Z8NtI/edit#gid=0

  




9\. Total cell number was:     5,680,000  

10\. Transfer into styrofoam box for transport to the Garvan for FACS sorting




11\. Transfer 30 mL of CHO-S cell suspension into a 50 mL falcon tube

12\. Centrifuge at 650 x g for 5 minutes     13:12 - 13:17  

13\. Aspirate supernatant and resuspend pellet in 20 mL of growth media

14\. Take a 10 uL sample and perform a cell count

Total cell count:  120,000,000

15\. Place tube on ice for transport to the Garvan
