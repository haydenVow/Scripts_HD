Tested for sterility

  1. Took a sample and transfer it to the well of a well plate.
  2. Observed the sample under the microscope.
    1. Signs of contamination include cloudy culture medium, motile particles visible under the 60x or 100x objective.

Calibrated dissolved oxygen probe

  1. Ran the calibration routine as per the operating manual
    1. Sparged nitrogen gas at high flow rate and with high impeller speed until dissolved oxygen reading equilibrated at a very low level.
    2. Set that level as 0%
    3. Sparged air at high flow rate and with high impeller speed until dissolved oxygen reading equilibrated at a high level.
    4. Set that level as 100%

Set level probe

  1. Loosened the nut around the antifoam/level probe.
  2. Gently rotated and pulled the probe out until it reached the desired height.
  3. Tightened the nut until finger tight.

NotesNEVER push the probe back into the bioreactor after autoclaving as this
can introduce contamination.

Seeded the batch

  1. Thoroughly wiped down the seed bottle and corresponding line from the bioreactor with 70% ethanol.
  2. Placed the seed bottle and the end of the seed line in the BSC next to the bioreactor.
  3. Aseptically transferred the seed cells to the seed bottle.
  4. Make an aseptic connection between the bottle and the bioreactor seed line.
  5. Pumped the seed cells into the bioreactor.

Programmed the feed schedule:

  1. To create a schedule to to turn on the pump after 2 days (48 hours) for 22.5 minutes (~450 mL at ~20 mL/minute), followed the instructions below:  

    1. Opened the SUBS-B pump menu
    2. Changed the SUBS-B MODE to MANUAL:OFF  

    3. Opened the PROFILE sub-menu
    4. Set a timepoint for 000:00:00 with 0% pump output.
    5. Set a timepoint for 048:00:00 with 0% pump output.  

    6. Set a timepoint for 048:00:01 with 100% pump output.
    7. Set a timepoint for 048:22:30 with 100% pump output.
    8. Set a timepoint for 048:22:31 with 0% pump output.
  2. To create a schedule to to turn on the pump again after 4 days (96 hours) for 45 minutes (~900 mL at ~20 mL/minute), followed the instructions below:  

    1. Set a timepoint for 000:00:00 with 0% pump output.
    2. Set a timepoint for 096:00:00 with 0% pump output.  

    3. Set a timepoint for 096:00:01 with 100% pump output.
    4. Set a timepoint for 096:45:00 with 100% pump output.
    5. Set a timepoint for 096:45:01 with 0% pump output.  

  3. To program the pump to follow the schedule:  

    1. Changed the SUBS-B MODE to PROFILE
    2. Closed the menu
