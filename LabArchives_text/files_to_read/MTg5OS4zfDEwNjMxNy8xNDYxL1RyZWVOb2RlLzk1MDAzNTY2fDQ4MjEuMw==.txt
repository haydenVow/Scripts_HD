Growth Media:

  * [X]  DMEM/F12 + 20% FBS + 1X P/S + P38i (10uM)




### Prepared materials:

1\. Aliquotted the required volume of each reagent and then placed all
aliquots to warm in the water bath for a minimum of 20 minutes prior to use:

  1. dPBS (for washing before Trypsinization), 100 mL per g Cytodex 1:     180    mL in     1 x Medium Sample Container    tubes
  2. Trypsin/EDTA, 100 mL per g Cytodex 1:     180    mL in     6 x 50mL Centrifuge    tubes
  3. Growth media (for neutralizing) 100 mL per g Cytodex 1:     180    mL in     1 x Medium Sample Container    tubes
  4. dPBS (for washing microcarriers after Trypsinization), 100 mL per g Cytodex 1:     180    mL in   1 x Medium Sample Container     tubes
  5. Growth media (for pellet resuspension):     10    mL in    1 x 15mL Centrifuge     tubes

Time that all aliquots were placed in the water bath the warm before use
14:10  

Note: if aliquots were placed in water bath at different time, record the time
stamp for each individual solution.




Stained and imaged cells adhered to microcarriers

  1. Removed culture(s) from the incubator and placed them in the BSC  `| 14:30 |`
  2. Swirled culture(s) by hand on the flat surface of the BSC for 5 seconds, the lid was quickly removed and a 10-20uL sample of the suspension was taken while the liquid was still in motion. This ensures the carriers were evenly mixed at time of sampling.
  3. Transferred the aliquot(s) to a well on a 96 well plate and mixed it with 80-90uL of dPBS containing 1% w/v poloxomer 88 and 20uL/mL of Hoechst 33342. 
  4. Returned cultures to the incubator  `| 14:32 am/pm|`
  5. Left the 96 well plate to incubate at room temperature, in the dark (away from light), for 12 minutes.  `| 14:36 am/pm |`
  6. After incubation the wells were inspected under the Axio microscope, 5x objective.
  7. Using https://mia-capture.vow.tools/#/, 3 sets of same frame images using the DAPI and PHASE channels were captured for each well `| : am/pm|`
    1. Manually set the exposure time for DAPI channel to the exposure time seen when carriers are viewed using the automatic exposure adjustment. (i.e if automatic exposure adjustment reads 0.002ms, set manual adjustment exposure time to be 0.002ms. 
    2. Fluorescence intensity of the UV lamp was adjusted until the centre of each microcarrier was barely visible compared to the space between microcarriers.
  8. Once images were captured, Image pairs were assigned a 'location ID' in MIA capture. 
  9. Images captured were then selected for analysis using the 'uCarrier cell count plastic' tool from MIA capture.

## Incubate flask:

  1. Stop the shaker

  3. Restart the shaker at the `speed required for detachment` \- see the table below. 15:00 - 15:15
  4. After `7-15 `minutes, stop the shaker
  5. Remove the flask from the shaker
  6. Restart the shaker

## Neutralize the detachment reagent:

  1. Add fresh, pre-warmed growth medium to the flask
  2. Mix the suspension vigorously
  3. Allow the microcarriers to settle for at least 2 minutes

Observations/Summary:

Microcarriers exhibited low confluence before harvest.

There were no cells still attached to the microcarriers after harvest.

Despite this, the harvest was poor, probably due to the low confluence and NOT
due to poor harvest efficiency.




SOPs used:

### None.




### Results:

  * Results were;
    * [ ]  As Usual (this is a repetitive task)
    * [X]  Unexpected because...microcarrier seed cultures had low pre-harvest confluence
    * [ ]  Need to be further analysed
    * [ ]  Other (.......)
