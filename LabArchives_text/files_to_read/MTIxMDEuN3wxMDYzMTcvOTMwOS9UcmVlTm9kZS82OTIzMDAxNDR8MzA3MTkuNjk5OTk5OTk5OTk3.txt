Aim:


To assess cell adhesion of Nuvonis fibroblasts on nanofibrous soy scaffolds
from Gelatex  

  


Hypothesis:


Nuvonis cells will adhere and maintain adherence of over 70% confluence to
nanofibrous soy scaffolds after 14 days in ACF media.Copy from Header Info

Background
  
Y/N     LinksJustification  
Is this a continuation of a previous experiment/series of work?  Y  
(sort of)Zein and Gelatin nanofibrous scaffold work.We have investigated
nanofibrous scaffolds from Gelatex (zein and gelatin) before using DOLLY12
MuSCs. Over 60% adhesion was achieved on all scaffolds, in either ACF or serum
containing media, following 24h of cell culture and was maintained until d14.
However, due to the gelatin being from an animal source and the zein resulting
in a negative sensory experience these scaffolds were not pursued any further.  
  
Gelatex have now developed a soy based nanofibrous scaffold. Which we intend
to test with our Nuvonis cell line.  
Is the experiment based on findings from literature research? N

 Seeding density

  21M per 6wp sized scaffolds

  

 0.7M per 96wp sized scaffolds

0.7M per scaffold was the optimum seeding density for zein nanofibrous
scaffolds based on confluence by day 14 of culture, relative to 1M and 2M
cells per scaffold (see report).  
  
Past work was done on 96 wp sized scaffolds with a surface area of ~0.32 cm^2
per piece. This experiment will also employ 6 wp sized scaffolds with a
surface area of 9.6 cm^2 per piece (30x difference). Scaling up a seeding
density of 0.7M/scaffold on 0.32 cm^2 is equivalent to 21M cells/scaffolds on
a 9.6 cm^2 scaffold piece.  
  
6wp sized pieces will be used so that sufficient scaffold material can be used
for sensory testing.  
  
  

          (See previous Gelatex scaffold report for zein and gelatin scaffold materials).  
  
 Media condition

 ACF and PRF for 6wp sized pieces, ACF + PR for 96wp sized pieces, plus
positive serum controls + PR

We are aiming for ACF so will be using ACF media. We will exclude phenol red
from the media on the 6wp scaffolds as these samples are for sensory testing.
P/S will also be removed from these samples in the last few days of culture.

 To find out

 Live Hoechst staining for D1 and D7, fixed DAPI staining for D14 of 96wp size
pieces and imaged using the Main Lab Zaber. Scaffolds scored for confluence by
at least 2 separate scorers.  
  
6wp size pieces are for sensory testing.
