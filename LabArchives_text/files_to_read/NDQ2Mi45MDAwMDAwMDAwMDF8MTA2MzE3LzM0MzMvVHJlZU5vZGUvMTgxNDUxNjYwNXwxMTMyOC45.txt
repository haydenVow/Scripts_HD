### Process:

1\. Took image of vessel with microscope on phase setting.

3\. Aliquotted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then
placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath for a minimum of 20 minutes
prior to use:

  1. TrypLE:      28   mL in      1   tubes
  2.  dPBS (for neutralising):     1 x 3mL, 2 x 5mL, 1 x 15mL    mL
  3.  dPBS (for washing):      1 x 3mL, 2 x 5mL, 1 x 15mL      mL
  4. Growth media (for pellet resuspension):    30     mL
  5. Growth media (for seeding):    300     mL 

Time that all aliquots were placed in the water bath the warm before use
12:53 pm

Note: if aliquots were placed in water bath at different time, record the time
stamp for each individual solution.




4\. Removed vessel(s) from the incubator    13:37 pm

5\. Washed the vessel(s) with dPBS (warmed).

6\. Added     see above table    mL tryple to each vessel/well and incubated
at 37˚C.

  1. Start/Finish for TrypLE was     13:44 - 14:01 pm 

7\. Neutralised with    use table above for volumes    dPBS and combined cell
suspension into a   1 x tube per clone.

8\. Centrifuged at 650 x g for 5 min.

  1. Start/Finish time for centrifugation was    14:09 - 14:14 pm 




9\. Aspirated the supernatant(s).

10\. Resuspended pellet(s) in         mL          media     :   a/pm

11\. Aliquoted          of resuspended cells into a microcentrifuge tube for
cell count.

12\. Performed a cell count using the haemocytometer and recorded the cell
count data in the Google Doc spreadsheet: Cell Count Spreadsheet or cell count
widget below

  1. Total cell number was:           
  2. Volume of cell suspension required for subculture was:           
  3. Cell density per vessel:          




13\. Transferred     all      µl of 3J15 cell suspension to the pre-warmed
9mL Growth media and into  2 x T25 flasks

13\. Transferred     all      µl of 5B14 cell suspension to the pre-warmed
27mL Growth media and into  1 x T175 flask

13\. Transferred     all      µl of 1E24 cell suspension to the pre-warmed
27mL Growth media and into  1 x T175 flask

13\. Transferred     all      µl of 2J15 cell suspension to the pre-warmed
84 mL Growth media and into  3 x T175 flasks

16\. Transferred vessel(s) to incubate at:      15:02 pm  

  * [ X]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (avian cells)
