Process:

  1. The 'conditions' storage plates were placed in the incubator to warm media. 15:50
  2. The 'E6' storage plates were placed in the incubator to warm media.
  3. 100% was media (140uL/well) was slowly aspirated from 2-3 columns at a time before adding 70uL/well of media from the corresponding 'conditions' plates. i.e. media from column 1 of 'conditions' plate 1 into column 1 of culture plate 1 and so on. This was performed for all columns of all 3 plates. Tips were changed in between columns. The 'conditions' storage plates were then sealed with an adhesive sealing mat and placed in fridge (4 degrees C). ~16:20-16:40
  4. 70uL/well was added from corresponding 'E6' storage plates to cultures plates. i.e. media from column 1 of 'E6' plate 1 into column 1 of culture plate 1 and so on. Tips were changed in between columns. The 'E6' storage plates were then sealed with an adhesive sealing mat and placed in fridge (4 degrees C). ~16:50-17:13
  5. Returned vessel to incubate at: 

  * [X]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (aviary cells)

  

  * [X]  Thermo Incubator (ID #13)
  * [ ]  Top Sanyo Incubator (ID #25)
  * [ ]  Bottom Sanyo Incubator
  * [ ]  Top Binder Incubator
  * [ ]  Bottom Binder Incubator




### Observations/Summary:

 100 % media changed on vessel(s)

6613-DOLLY12-Sheep P11-1of3

6614-DOLLY12-Sheep P11-2of3

6615-DOLLY12-Sheep P11-3of3

  

50% of media was from the DSD conditions (i.e. 39 different media conditions -
E6 containing various growth factors as dictated by the DSD)

50% of media was from E6 (made from bullet) - except in control wells were 2%
HS or fresh E6 was used.

  




### Results

  * Results were;
    * [X]  As Usual (this is a repetitive task)
    * [ ]  Unexpected because...
    * [ ]  Need to be further analysed
    * [ ]  Other (.......)
