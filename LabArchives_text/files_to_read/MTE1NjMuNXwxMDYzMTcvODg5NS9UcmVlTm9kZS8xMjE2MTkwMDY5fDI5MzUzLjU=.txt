Protocol

  1. Check gas pressure at regulator for all gases in use. Ensure pressure is the same, and is between 1-3 bar.
  2. Check alarms in warnings and alerts screen. Dismiss any non-applicable alarms. 
  3. Inspect each physical bioreactor and ensure all clamps are sealed. Check the colour and consistency of the broth (e.g. if milky - contamination, or foamy - cell death)
  4. Inspect the bioreactor specs in the software and note if any parameter is out of spec. 

  
  
Deviations & notes

  * Pressure at 1.5 bar for all gases
  * pH reading of 10 suddenly dropped to below 6 after a sample was taken from BR1, and returned to 7.6 after 30-40 mins
  * DO also corrected itself from 30% back to 80%
  * Foam levels are fine (very little present in all bioreactors)
  * Base reservoirs are untouched in all bioreactors
  * Final volume of BR1 is reading 201 mL..?

Protocol

  1. Follow on-screen prompts to draw sample from the sampling line: 
    * take 1mL draw and reserve in 50mL falcon tube
    * take 1mL draw and place 0.5mL in eppendorf tube, place remainder in 50mL falcon tube
  2. Cell count 0.5mL in eppendorf tube and record in G-sheet (below)
  3. Return cell suspension from 1.5mL tube to 50mL falcon tube for pH reading
  4. Calibrate pH meter and read values for all samples. Record pH values below

Sampling / Monitoring Workflow

  * NC counts of stock flasks
  * Fill 5 x 1.5 mL eppendorf tubes with 250 uL ultra pure water
  * Draw 1 + 1 mL from 4 x bioreactors (keep first 1 mL in syringe, deposit second 1 mL in 50 mL falcon)
  * Sample SFA for manual count, NC count, biochem analysis and pH measurement (1.5 mL)
  * Add 250 uL from the falcon tubes + SFA tube into the tubes with water
  * Reserve 100 uL for cell counting (manual and NC)
  * Do manual + NC counts (x5 each - 4 BRs + SFA)
  * Add c/s from first draw into falcon tubes + add SFA c/s into falcon tube (5 tubes in total)
  * Take offline pH measurements
  * Spin diluted samples and remove 450 uL of supernatant from each tube (5 in total)
  * Label and store in box in -80degC fridge (CryoCube)

  
Consumables needed  
\- 20 x 1.5 mL eppendorf tubes (5 for water, 5 for samples for the supernatant
to carry out biochemical analysis, 5 for trypan blue, 5 for cell suspension
samples for manual and NC counts)  
\- 5 x 50 mL falcon tubes  
\- 8 x 5 mL syringes
