Culture IDs to feed

Vessel ID(s)  
Vessel Type(s)  
  
7136-DOLLY12-Sheep P13-1of1  
48WP (scaffolds with inserts)  
  
7139-DOLLY12-Sheep P13-1of1  
48WP (adherent culture - no inserts)  
  
  
  




Process:

1\. Filled wells of new 48WP with inserts with 1 mL of respective E6 media
(according to plate map). Moved plate to incubator. Timestamp: 14:38

2\. Retrieved culture plate from incubator.

3\. Using sterile tweezers, moved scaffolds across to 48WP with inserts
containing fresh, warm media.

4\. Returned new plate to incubate at: 14:50
