100% Treatment on XX


Procedure - Treatment

  1. Turn on the water bath and set to 37'C.
  2. Aliquot  required growth media into a sterile container/s and add:  
    i) Vitamin C (aka LAA2P) [stock concentration 100mg/mL] to a working concentration of 50ug/mL in growth media i.e. 500uL per 1L of media.  
   ii) TGF-b1 [stock concentration 0.002mg/L] to a working concentration of
10ng/mL in growth media i.e. 5mL per 1L of media.

  3. Place in the water bath and heat for at least 20 minutes.
  4. Observe the cell flasks for confluence under the microscope using 4 x magnification and take images as required. 
  5. Transfer flasks to the BSC and remove required volume of media from each flask (according to the Table below).
  6. Replace the same volume into each flask with the prepared growth media.
  7. Return the flasks to the incubator.

observations of roller bottle confluence:

8882: 70-80% confluent at the bottom, 30-40% confluent around the middle, 80%
confluent at the top

8885: 80-85% confluent - consistent

8886: 75-85% confluent - relatively consistent. A small patch near the bottom
that was about 40-50% confluent.

8881: 70% confluent - relatively consistent. A patch near the bottom that's
~30-40% confluent

8883: 70-80% confluent - consistent

8884: 80-90% confluent - consistent

  

To keep consistency between the two treatment groups:

Vit C: 8882, 8885, 8886

TGF + Vit C: 8881, 8883, 8884


TREATMENT 1 - VitC Only
Treatment 2 - VitC & Tgf-b
