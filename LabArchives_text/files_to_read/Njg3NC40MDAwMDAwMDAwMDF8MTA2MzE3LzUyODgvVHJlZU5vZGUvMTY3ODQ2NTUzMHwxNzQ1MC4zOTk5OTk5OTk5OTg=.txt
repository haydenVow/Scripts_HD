Adherent cells were first observed on day 13 in culture.

This culture was maintained for 34 days prior to being terminated due to a
failure to re-attach to the culture vessel after its 2nd passage. It is
unclear why these cells suddenly failed, as they were in apparent good health
up until that point and standard passaging protocols had been followed.
Between the 1st and second passages, the cells had an approximate doubling
time of 2.59 days.
