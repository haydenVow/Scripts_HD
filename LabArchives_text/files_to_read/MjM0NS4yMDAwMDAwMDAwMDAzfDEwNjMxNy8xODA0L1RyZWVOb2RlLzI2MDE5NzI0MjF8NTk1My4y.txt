Process:

Live/Dead staining (Staining well A2 with CMFDA but this time with double
amount of PI i.e. 20 uL instead of 10 uL):

Preparation of stock and and working solutions for CMFDA Cell Tracker (used
due to not being able to locate Calcein)

1\. Remove the CMFDA powder from the freezer (main lab) and allow it to warm
to room temperature. Each aliquot is 50 ug.

  1.  Briefly centrifuge the tube to pellet the CMFDA powder

2\. Add 50 uL high-quality, anhydrous DMSO to the powder and pipette up and
down until well suspended. This will yield a 1 mM stock solution.

  1. NOTE - Once prepared, the DMSO stock solution should be stored at -20'C in a 70 mL pot submerged in silica-gel desiccant beads for a short period for one series of experiments. 

*Steps 1 & 2 were conducted the previous day with the DMSO/CMFDA stock solution stored at -20'C (MAIN LAB #71)  

3\. Transfer 10 uL of the 1mM CMFDA stock solution to 5 mL of prepared
DMEM/F12 PRF growth media in a light safe 15 mL falcon tube to protect it from
light. Vortex to ensure thorough mixing with the resulting solution being
approximately 2 uM CMFDA working solution.

  1. Note*. Only 10 uL of stock solution was used to preserve quantity and because the amount of media + CMFDA needed was only 4 mL for two wells.

4\. Place the pre-aliquoted 10 mL of DMEM/F12 PRF growth media that was
prepared the previous day (09 June) into the water bath to be warmed.

  1.  Transfer both the CMFDA working stock solution and DMEM/F12 PRF growth media into the water bath to be pre-warmed  10:50

5\. Aspirate the growth media from one well (A2) from the non-treated 6-well
plate

6\. Add 2 mL of pre-warmed DMEM/F12 PRF growth media to the non-treated 6-well
plate that had media removed from it in the previous step (well A2) as a rinse
step to remove any residue serum.

7\. Aspirate the growth media from the non-treated 6-well plate well (A2).

8\. Add 2 mL of pre-warmed CMFDA working solution to the A2 well from the non
treated 6-well plate and incubate for 30 minutes at 37'C covered in foil to
protect samples from light.

  1. Start/Finish time was:  11:04 - 11:34
  2.  If the CMFDA working solution is no longer required dispose of solution as aqueous waste as aqueous solutions of CMFDA are susceptible to hydrolysis and should be used within one day.

9\. Remove plate from incubator and transfer into the BSC

10\. Add 20 uL of propidium iodide (Frozen aliquot in main lab freezer is 0.2
mg/mL - was originally 1 mg/mL but had been diluted 201 uL in 799 uL of dPBS)
into the well from the non treated 6-well plate and incubate for 5 minutes at
room temperature in the dark.

  1. Start/Finish time was:  11:41 - 11:46   

11\. Without changing the media in the well, image well (A2) from the non
treated plates on the Axio fluorescence microscope (channel AF488 for CMFDA
[Live cells] and AF 555 for propidium iodide [Dead cells])

12\. Return the non treated plate to the incubator.

Live/Dead staining (Re-staining well B1 with CMFDA + PI):

Preparation of stock and and working solutions for CMFDA Cell Tracker

1\. Remove the CMFDA powder from the freezer (main lab) and allow it to warm

  1.  Briefly centrifuge the tube to pellet the CMFDA powder

2\. Add 50 uL high-quality, anhydrous DMSO to the powder and pipette up and

3\. Transfer 10 uL of the 1mM CMFDA stock solution to 5 mL of prepared
DMEM/F12 PRF growth media in a light safe 15 mL falcon tube to protect it from
light. Vortex to ensure thorough mixing with the resulting solution being
approximately 2 uM CMFDA working solution.

  1. NOTE - Remaining 40 uL of stock solution was aliquoted into 10 uL aliquots and stored at -20'C in a 70 mL pot submerged in silica-gel desiccant beads for a short period for one series of experiments. 

4\. Place the pre-aliquoted 10 mL of DMEM/F12 PRF growth media that was
prepared the previous day (09 June) into the water bath to be warmed.

  1.  Transfer both the CMFDA working stock solution and DMEM/F12 PRF growth media into the water bath to be pre-warmed  12:37

5\. Aspirate the growth media from one well (B1) from the non-treated 6-well
plate

6\. Add 2 mL of pre-warmed DMEM/F12 PRF growth media to the non-treated 6-well
plate that had media removed from it in the previous step (well B1) as a rinse
step to remove any residue serum.

7\. Aspirate the growth media from the non-treated 6-well plate well (B1).

8\. Add 2 mL of pre-warmed CMFDA working solution to the B1 well from the non
treated 6-well plate and incubate for 30 minutes at 37'C covered in foil to
protect samples from light.

  1. Start/Finish time was:  12:47 - 13:17
  2.  If the CMFDA working solution is no longer required dispose of solution as aqueous waste as aqueous solutions of CMFDA are susceptible to hydrolysis and should be used within one day.

9\. Remove plate from incubator and transfer into the BSC

10\. Add 10 uL of propidium iodide (Frozen aliquot in main lab freezer is 0.2
mg/mL - was originally 1 mg/mL but had been diluted 201 uL in 799 uL of dPBS)
into the well from the non treated 6-well plate and incubate for 5 minutes at
room temperature in the dark.

  1. Start/Finish time was:  13:19 - 13:24   

11\. Without changing the media in the well, image well (B1) from the non
treated plates on the Axio fluorescence microscope (channel AF488 for CMFDA
[Live cells] and AF 555 for propidium iodide [Dead cells])

12\. Return the non treated plate to the incubator.

Observations/Summary:

\- CMFDA stock solution was discarded after its use today

\- A new CMFDA powder stocked was thawed for the re staining experiment and
aliquoted as 10 uL aliquots.

\- Cells re-stained with CMFDA fluoresced under the 488 channel indicating
that the cells survived despite multiple exposures to the CMFDA cell tracker
dye.  

  




Results:

  * Results were;
    * [ ]  As Usual (this is a repetitive task)
    * [x]  Unexpected because... lack of signal for CMFDA stained cells in well A2 (likely due to freeze thaw cycle)
    * [ ]  Need to be further analysed
    * [ ]  Other (.......)
