RELATED TO MILESTONE: KR1: Develop a QMS-compliant serum-free media that
supports 20+ doublings of our chosen species in suspension

AIM/PURPOSE: To achieve doublings of Fibroblasts in ACF media.

HYPOTHESIS: That ACF media will support 10+ doublings of fibroblasts.

  

RESULTS SUMMARY: This should only be completed if the data can be visualised
with a single graph/image, otherwise simply state "See Report".

CONCLUSIONS: What were the overall findings? This should be a concise summary
and not duplicate the information in the results/report. For example "We found
that Bovine MuSCs could only achieve a cell density 50% of that observed with
planar culture without undergoing precocious differentiation. These results
mean that we are currently limited to X cells/ml in suspension culture until
we find a way to inhibit precocious differentiation"

NEXT STEPS: This should be a dot point list of any immediate outcomes, changes
to SOPs, as well as providing a direct link to any new experiments arising
from these findings. Importantly, this section should also include any
potential DEPLOYMENTS to the production team
