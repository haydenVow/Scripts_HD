300mL (Sarah, I've not passaged these cells before so I apologise in advance
if I have underestimated how much you will use to seed. There is heaps more in
the fridge if you need. Fridge 126, library lab  
PBS  
5Should be used at room temp so no aliquots prepared. Please use stock on the
bench  
Tryple

  1. Remove SFM aliquot from fridge 126, and warm in the water bath (>15min). 10:22
  2. PBS, TrypLE aliquots should be used at room temp for these cells, so I have not prepared aliquots of these. 
  3. Image the flask 10:24
  4. Remove medium from the flask. 
  5. Wash cells 1x with 13 ml of PBS. 
  6. Add 5 ml 1xTrypLE. Tilt the flask to cover the cell monolayer with 1xTrypLE. Incubate the flask for 6-8 min at 37°C until cells appear rounded (check under microscope). 
  7. Gently tap the flask several times to completely detach the cells and add 7 ml SFM. 
  8. Rinse the flask several times with the 1xTrypLE/SFM mixture by pipetting and transfer the cell suspension to a 50 ml conical bottom centrifuge tube. 
  9. Rinse the flask with another 8 ml SFM and add cells to the centrifuge tube. 
  10. Centrifuge for 10 min at 310 g and 22°C in a swing-out rotor. 
  11. Remove supernatant and resuspend cells in 10 ml SFM and mix cell suspension by pipetting several times. 
  12. Perform cell count

Total cell number: 11,200,000

  13. Seed cells into flasks at roughly 7000-7500cells/cm
