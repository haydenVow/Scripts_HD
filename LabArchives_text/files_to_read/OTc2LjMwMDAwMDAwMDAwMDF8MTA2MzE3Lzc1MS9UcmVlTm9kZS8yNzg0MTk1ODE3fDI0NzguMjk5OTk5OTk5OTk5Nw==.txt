RELATED TO MILESTONE:  Milestone Maturation 2b

AIM/PURPOSE: To construct an assembly with a culture surface area of >100 cm2
that can be perfused (automatic media changes) and improves maturation over a
6-well plate control

HYPOTHESIS: Can we add perfusion and keep it sterile? Will cells delaminate or
will there be other undesirable/unpredictable effects due to shear?
