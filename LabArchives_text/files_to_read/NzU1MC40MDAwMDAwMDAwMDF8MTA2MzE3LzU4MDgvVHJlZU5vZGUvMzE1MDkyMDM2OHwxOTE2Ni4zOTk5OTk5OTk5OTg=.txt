Prepare materials for thaw and seed:

  

1\. Aliquotted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then
placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath for a minimum of 20 minutes
prior to use:

  *  Growth media (for seeding):   2x 600 mL D/F + 10%FBS
  * Time that aliquot was placed in the water bath to warm before use:   15:07

  




## Thaw and seed vial:

3\. Collected the cryovial from Liquid Nitrogen storage & place in foam
floater in water bath for 5 min  15:55  

Location where cryovial was collected from:

Vial details:   3  xcryovials at   10M  cells each for a total of   30 M
cells

`4. Ethanol sprayed & transferred the vial(s) to the BSC.`

`5.  Added  500 µL of Growth Media (to generate a total volume of 1mL in the
cryovial) to the cryovial, resuspended the cell suspension gently to reduce
osmotic shock. `

`6. Collected the entire 1mL of cell suspension & transfer into the pre-warmed
tube of Growth Media. `

`7. Using a 10mL serological pipette, resuspended & distributed the cells
evenly in the   600 mL of pre-warmed Growth Media (prepared in Step 2). `

`8.. Transferred flask/plate(s) to incubate at: 16:10`
