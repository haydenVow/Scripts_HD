Prepare materials for thaw and seed:

2\. Aliquotted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then
placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath for a minimum of 20 minutes
prior to use:

  *  Growth media (for seeding):   120 mL 
  * Time that aliquot was placed in the water bath to warm before use:   15:02 a/pm 

  




## Thaw and seed vial:

3\. Collected the cryovial from Liquid Nitrogen storage & place in foam
floater in water bath for 5 min  : - : a/pm

Location where cryovial was collected from:

Vial details:  1   x  5M  cryovials at   5M  cells each for a total of    5M
cells

Brew

Tower/Bucket # 2

Box/Cane #6  

Vial location: H9  

Vial ID(s): 3708 (old ID)  

`4. Ethanol sprayed & transferred the vial(s) to the BSC.`

`5.  Added  500µL of Growth Media (to generate a total volume of 1mL in the
cryovial) to the cryovial, resuspended the cell suspension gently to reduce
osmotic shock. `

`6. Collected the entire 1mL of cell suspension & transfer into the pre-warmed
container of Growth Media. `

`7. Using a 25mL serological pipette, resuspended & distributed the cells
evenly in the   120mL of pre-warmed Growth Media (prepared in Step 2). `

`8. Transfered   30mL to 4 separate T175 flasks`

`9. Transfered flask/plate(s) to incubate at: `

  * [x]  30ºC, 5% CO2 (CHOMP cells incubator 140
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (aviary cells)

  

Making labels

Note - You will need to increase the passage number by one. (i.e. if your
thawed vial ID has a passage number of 3, when you make a culture ID for you
vessel you will need change the passage number to 4 on Airtable.)
