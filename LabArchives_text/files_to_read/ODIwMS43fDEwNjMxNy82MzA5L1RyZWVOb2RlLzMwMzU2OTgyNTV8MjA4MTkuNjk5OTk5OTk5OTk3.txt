### Process:

1\. Took 2 x images of vessel with microscope on phase setting (4X to assess
confluence)

2\. Aliquoted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then
placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath for a minimum of 20 minutes
prior to use:

  1. TrypLE: 10 mL 
  2.  dPBS (for neutralising & washing): 20 mL
  3. Growth medium (CHOMP): 4 mL
  4. Growth medium (CHO-S): 4 mL 




3\. Removed vessel(s) from the incubator

4\. Washed the vessel(s) with dPBS (warmed).

5\. Added   10  mL tryple to each vessel/well and incubated at 37ËšC.  

6\. Neutralised with   10 mL per flask   dPBS and combined cell suspension
into   1 x 50 mL  tube.

7\. Centrifuged at 650 x g for 5 min.




8\. Aspirated the supernatant(s).

9\. Resuspended pellet in   4  mL   Growth   medium. If medium is really
cloudy/we have lots of cells/cells are pelleting themselves by gravity, go
with 4 mL. If less cells, clearer cell suspension etc., go with 2 mL  

~~10\. Take 10uL aliquot for a cell count.  ~~

  *  ~~Total Cell count:~~ ~~~~  

10\. Stored on ice in esky




Harvest CHO-S cells

  1. Pipetted 500 uL of CHO-S cells from E-500 culture into 1 x 15 mL tube
  2. Performed cell count 
  3. Added 3.5 mL CHO-S medium to tube 
  4. Stored on ice in esky
