(in growth media, 37'C, 5%CO2)

\- zein scaffolds became amorphous after 1 day in culture conditions -
difficult to handle - stuck to tweezers when transferring

\- could not "flip" zein scaffolds to image other side due to their blob-like
morphology

\- zaber images show seemingly good confluence on the zein scaffolds on d1
prolif and d8 diff

\- zaber images show no cells remaining adhered to the zein/gluten scaffolds

Note - Zein/gluten samples showed a significant loss of confluence by day 7 in
differentiation medium, wherein very little to no cells were observed on any
of the samples, and for this reason were not included in the above graph. A
reason for this cell loss could likely be related to the inability to move the
scaffolds during cell culture. Wherein, from day 1 it was difficult to
visualize whether the cells seeded had adhered predominantly to the base of
the 96-wells or to the scaffold itself. Regardless of using non-tissue
cultured treated plates, we have typically observed high cell adhesion and
confluence on the base of wells following cell seeding, and for this reason we
move scaffolds to new plates following seeding (day 1). Thus, as these
scaffolds could not be moved it is likely that the cells on the base of the
wells became overly confluent during the total 9 day cell culture period and
subsequently became apoptotic and/or de-laminated from the base of the wells
and were lost during the daily media changes. In addition, over confluent and
dying cells on the base of the well will have released apoptosis signals and
detrimental by-products into the media, and this may have had a negative
effect on any cells which had initially adhered to the zein/gluten, and would
explain the lack of scaffold confluence on these samples.  
  
Based on the graphs above (Fig.1-2) it can determined that a seeding density
of >0.5M may be better for achieving higher scaffold confluence. However,
based on the data without outlier removal this was not a significant finding.
Wherein, based on one-way ANOVA analysis only the scaffold type condition
(zein and zein/glurten) was identified as a significant influencing factor on
scaffold confluence (see Fig.3 below), with zein only scaffolds having a
significantly higher confluence than the zein/gluten, which lost all cells by
day 7 in differentiation. Whereas seeding density and scaffold wetness did not
have a significant effect on confluence.

When outliers were removed from the data set it could be inferred that the
0.7M seeding condition resulted in higher confluence than the 0.5M and 1.3M
cells/scaffold seeding approaches. In addition, the wet treatment appeared to
have a positive effect on confluence relative to dry scaffold condition when
seeded with 0.7M, but the benefit of wet versus dry seeding was not seen for
the other two seeding densities. Despite, these observation it should be noted
that with outliers removed the replicate number for each condition (except
0.5M wet) was reduced to n=2 and consequently cannot be considered a reliable
finding.

Fig.3 One-way ANOVA output  
  
It should also be noted that the high variation between the zein scaffold
conditions (with and without outliers) was likely caused by the shrinking
effect observed for the zein scaffolds (Fig.4-5). Wherein, upon placing in
cell culture conditions the scaffold material shrunk and 'scrunched up'. It
was also observed that the degree of 'scrunching' varied between the
scaffolds. Wherein, the non-seeded side of the scaffolds enclosed and
scrunched over the seeded area of the scaffolds, covering and distorting
imaging of the scaffold (Fig.5). As a result, it is difficult to rely on only
DAPI imaging of these scaffolds to represent true confluence. In this way,
analysis may be better suited to our upcoming ELISA platform. In which janus
green elution from the scaffolds would give a more accurate representation of
how many cells remained on the scaffold by day 7, whereas our fluorescent
imaging analysis was clearly hindered by the changing scaffold morphology
(scrunching/shrinking).
