Notes  

After isolation, please split the crude homogenate into 4 equal portions and
freeze 3/4 of them.  1 portion from each biopsy should be placed into
immediate culture. See lab book here: https://au-

Seal the tube well with Parafilm and incubate in a 37°C water bath with
agitation (60rpm) for 1 hour.  Tubes should be positioned horizontally along
the shaking path and completely submerged in water. Use weights to keep the

from the surface of the supernatant

  
  
  
Add 1 mL stock Collagenase II solution and 1 mL stock Dispase solution to the

(pipette up & down) 10-15 times or until the suspension travels up and down
the pipette smoothly without clogging.

If the muscle is well digested, triturate through a 10mL serological pipette.

If there are still muscle chunks, `using a 10 mL syringe and 20-gauge needle,
aspirate and eject the muscle suspension in and out of the syringe 10 times.`

CRITICAL STEP: The needle may be clogged by small pieces of tendon or
undigested muscle during the first few attempts. If clogging occurs during
trituration, remove the clog from the tip of the needle. If clogging occurs
during ejection, pull the plunger up and down to move the clog out of
position. Eject towards the wall of the tube (as opposed to the bottom) to
avoid foaming.

Culture of the isolate  
  
All of the isolate was cultured immediately, none was cryopreserved due to the
tissue of origin already being frozen. This lowered the likelihood that live
cells will be present, so we decided to culture 100% of the isolate to give
any remaining cells the best chance at sticking down and growing.

A 100mm culture dish was seeded with all of the raw isolate in 10 mL of
culture media.

Culture media used was DMEM/F12 + 20% FBS + 1x PS (phenol-red containing).

  1. The pellet from the above section was re-suspended in 1 mL growth media using a P1000 pipette and sterile tip.
  2. The cell suspension was then diluted to 10 mL total volume with 9 mL more growth media and then transferred into a 100 mm culture dish
  3. The culture dish was gently swirled to cover the growth surface in the cell suspension and then the dish was placed directly into the incubator for an overnight incubation at 37C 5% CO2. Time of incubation: 16:24 pm
  4. The culture dish was labelled with the SV1 culture label with the following ID# 8028-WALLE01-Bennets Wallaby P0-1of1

Observations/Summary:

The sample was very smooth after the initial mincing step with scalpels and
also passed through the syringe and cell strainer very easily after digestion.
The pellets normally have some element of red blood cells (RBC's) but this one
had none at all and was very small in size overall.
