RELATED TO MILESTONE:  Fibroblasts_3_Achieve >10 doublings of DOLLY12
fibroblast clones in ACF media in suspension.

AIM/PURPOSE: To develop an ACF media that will allow fibroblasts to
proliferate well.

HYPOTHESIS: Adding albumin to the previous media known as E8 + fibroblast
goodies will allow fibroblasts to achieve 10 doublings in ACF media.

RESULTS SUMMARY: Fibroblasts survived in media containing E8+ goodies as well
as albumin for only three weeks, two passages.

CONCLUSIONS: The hypothesis was shown to be incorrect; adding albumin to these
cell culture medias was not sufficient to allow fibroblasts to achieve 10
doublings in ACF media.

NEXT STEPS: More research into ACF media to support fibroblast growth will
have to be conducted; the project is pivoting to focus on adapting cells to
suspension, but we will return to optimising ACF media to support fibroblast
proliferation in the future.
