Cell count data

Note

  * The initial seeding density for BIRDK and BIRDO was 1M cells, while BOBBO and BOBBK were seeded with 2M cells.
  * Counts prior to day 9 are not recorded here, due the the proven inaccuracy of the Zaber staining and counting protocols. The data below was obtained using standard trypan blue staining and manual counting.
