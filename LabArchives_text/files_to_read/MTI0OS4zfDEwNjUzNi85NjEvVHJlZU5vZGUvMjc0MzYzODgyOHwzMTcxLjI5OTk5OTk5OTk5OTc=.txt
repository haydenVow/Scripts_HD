Procedure

Mr Frosty Preparation (if using CryoStor CS10 for freezing medium)

  1. Prepare all available Mr Frostys' the day before harvesting by checking level of Isopropanol and no. of uses before refill. Note: After every 5th use of Mr Frosty, the isopropanol should be discarded and replaced with fresh isopropanol. 
  2. Refill Mr Frostys' with isoproponal if required.
  3. Store in the fridge overnight at 4'C.

Cell Harvest

  1. Turn on water bath and set temperature to 37C.
  2. Aliquot required volume of growth media for resuspension in sterile pot.
  3. Place aliquot in pre-warmed water bath and leave for ~20 minutes or until warmed.
  4. Transfer aliquots and flasks required for harvest into the BSC.
  5. Transfer the entire contents of the culture vessel(s) into sterile 50 mL falcon tubes.
  6. Centrifuge vessels at 300x g for 5 min.
  7.  Resuspend pellet(s) in 20 mL of growth media.
  8. Perform cell count using a haemocytometer and record counts below.
  9. Calculate the required volume of freeze medium to generate a concentration of 10M cells/mL in each 2 mL cryovial.
  10. Centrifuge the resuspended cells at 300 x g for 5 min.
  11. Resuspend cells in freeze medium [Freestyle CHO + 10% DMSO] (chilled to reduce DMSO toxicity).
  12. Aliquot 1000 uL of cell resuspension into cryovials and transfer to a Mr Frosty immediately and into the -80'C freezer. Be sure to label the order of Mr Frostys' filled. 
  13. Allow the cells to freeze for at least 18-24 hours before transferring to Liquid Nitrogen storage.
