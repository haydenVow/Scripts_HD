AIM/PURPOSE: Grow Nuvonis quail fibroblast cells in a single use 3L bioreactor
system

HYPOTHESIS: N/A. This work is a proof of concept process not an experiment

RESULTS SUMMARY:

  * Nuvonis cells were cultured in a stir-tank bioreactor vessel
    * 70 RPM (0.28m/s tip speed)
    * 20 ccm (20mL/min) gas flow rate, microsparging
    * 5 day batch time on average
  * Cells doubled in cell density 24 hours after performing draw and fill at 80% harvest 
    * Draw and fill performed consecutively twice 
  * Cells decreased in cell density and viability following an increase in agitation to 90 RPM

CONCLUSIONS:

  * initial parameters established for Nuvonis stir-tank culture. These require further optimisation from this point. 
  * the above optimisation will require a finalised media (e.g. mass transfer and sparging rates dependent upon material properties inherent to media formulation)

NEXT STEPS:

  * using parallelised bioreactor system, optimise:
    * tip speed
    * sparging rate and type (dependent on medium formulation)
    * optional - batch feeding program
