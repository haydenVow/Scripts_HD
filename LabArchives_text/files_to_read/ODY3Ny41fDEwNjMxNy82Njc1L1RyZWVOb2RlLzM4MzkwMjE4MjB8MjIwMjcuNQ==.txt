Reagents used:

NameID  
Growth/SFM M10147  
  
PBSA10205  
  
TrypleA9289  
  
2x CFM (SFM + 15% DMSO)M10147, S2745  
  
  
  




PREPARATION

On the day of cell freezing prepare sufficient amounts of SFM and 2xCFM for
freezing of cells and cool both media on ice for at least 1h (as we don't have
ice, place in the freezer just before beginning passage, put a Mr. Frosty in
there with them).

5mL SFM and 5mL 2xCFM 10:15




PASSAGE

  1. Warm media in 37C water bath (>15min). 10:28
  2. PBS, TrypLE aliquots should be used at room temp for these cells, so I have not prepared aliquots of these. 
  3. Image the flasks 
  4. Remove medium from the flasks. 10:40
  5. Wash each flask with 13 ml of PBS. 
  6. Add 5 ml 1xTrypLE to each flask Tilt the flask to cover the cell monolayer with 1xTrypLE. Incubate the flask for 6-8 min at 37Â°C until cells appear rounded (check under microscope). 
  7. Gently tap the flask several times to completely detach the cells and add 7 ml SFM to each flask. 
  8. Rinse the flask several times with the 1xTrypLE/SFM mixture by pipetting and transfer the cell suspension to a 50 ml conical bottom centrifuge tubes. 
  9. Rinse the flasks with another 8 ml SFM and add cells to the centrifuge tube. 
  10. Centrifuge for 10 min at 310 g.
  11. Remove supernatant and resuspend cells in 20 ml SFM and mix cell suspension by pipetting several times. 
  12. Perform cell count

SSIBtIylyrBQE5kRX5Z8NtI/edit#gid=0  
Total cell number:  155,200,000  

  13. 155.2M cells removed (20.69 mL cells suspension), separated into 2x 50mL tubes. centrifuge cells for 10 min at 310 g. Resuspend in 500ul of the cold SFM, then add 500ul of the cold 2x CFM. Transfer to Mr Frosty and -80C Freezer. 
  14. Seeded remaining cells into flasks at roughly 7000-7500cells/cm
