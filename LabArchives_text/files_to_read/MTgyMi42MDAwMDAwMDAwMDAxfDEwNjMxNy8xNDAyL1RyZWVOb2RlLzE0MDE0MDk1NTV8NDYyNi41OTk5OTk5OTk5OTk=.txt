Procedure


TEMPLATE

  1. On 25-May-2021, a repetitive "rubbing" sound was heard coming from the bioreactor stirrer.
  2. The stirrer was turned off and the stirrer motor removed
  3. Tom Tarento contacted Sartorius for troubleshooting advice.
  4. Sartorius responded with the following: Remove and moisten the rotating mechanical seal of the stirrer drive shaft
    1. If the stirrer drive shaft will not rotate at all or will only rotate when excessive force is applied, or if it squeaks while rotating: The two sliding surfaces of the rotating mechanical seal may be stuck together. This may be caused by the following factors:
      1. The stirrer drive shaft was cleaned or autoclaved in a conventional laboratory dishwasher. In this case, the sliding surfaces of the rotating mechanical seal are stuck together.
      2. The stirrer drive shaft is stationary for a long period (downtime). As a result, the sliding surfaces of the rotating mechanical seal are dry and stuck together.
    2. To prevent damage to the rotating mechanical seal: The sliding surfaces need to be detached from one another and moistened.  
Material: Some demineralized water (deionized water)

  5. Upon testing of the stirrer, no sticking feeling or rubbing sound was heard. The motor was re-installed and the normal operating conditions resumed.
