Took samples

  1. Unscrewed the "BENCHMARK" sample tube cover.
  2. Sprayed down the tube end with 70% ethanol.
  3. Connecedt a 10 mL sterile syringe.
  4. Withdrew slightly more than 3 mL (to purge the line).
  5. Discarded the 5 mL syringe.
  6. Connected a fresh sterile syringe and withdrew 10 mL of sample.
  7. Disconnected sample syringe and transferred sample to 50 mL falcon tube
  8. Sprayed sample tube end and cap with 70% ethanol, re-attached cap.

1\. Mixed 100 L of sample with 100 uL of Trypan blue in a fresh 500 uL tube

  2. Loaded 10uL of each Trypan  stained sample onto a slide.
  3. Calculated the cells/mL by converting the cells/mm2value shown in MIA capture
    1. Count cells per ROI
    2. Divide cells/ROI by area (in mm2) of ROI to get cells/mm2
    3. Multiply cells/mm2 by Neubauer constant (10,000) to get cells/mL
    4. Multiply cells/mL by culture volume (in mL) to get total cell count
  4. Took pH reading: 6.8
  5. Reduced CO2 flow from 25 ccm to 15 ccm (3% enrichment) to try to increase pH back to ~7.4

### Observations/Summary:Cells had increased in number from 100k cells/ml to
488 k cells/mL over ~3 days.
