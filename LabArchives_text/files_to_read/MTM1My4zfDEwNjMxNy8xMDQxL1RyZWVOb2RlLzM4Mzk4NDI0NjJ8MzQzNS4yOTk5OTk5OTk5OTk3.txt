Process:

1\. Aliquotted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then
placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath for a minimum of 20 minutes
prior to use:

  1. TrypLE:    3   mL in   1x 15 mL    tube
  2. dPBS (for neutralising)    6   mL in    1x 15 mL    tube
  3. Growth media (for pellet resuspension):    3   mL in    1x 15 mL    tube
  4. Times that all aliquots were placed in the water bath to warm before use  10:20 

Note: if aliquots were placed in water bath at different times, record the
time stamp for each individual solution.




2\. Washed the flask(s) with dPBS.

3\. Added    3   mL tryple to each vessel/well and incubated at 37ËšC for    15
min.

Note: Fibroblasts typically require 15-18 minutes of incubation with tryple,
slightly longer than MuSCs.

  1. Start/Finish time for centrifugation was  10:33  \-   10:48 

4\. Neutralised with    3 mL   dPBS (warmed) and combined cell suspension into
a    1x 15 mL   tube.

5\. Centrifuged at 650 x g for 5 min

  1. Start/Finish time for centrifugation was  10:52  \-  10:57 




6\. Aspirated the supernatant(s)

7\. Resuspended pellet(s) in      3  mL    Growth   media.

8\. Performed a cell count using the haemocytometer and recorded the cell
count data in the Google Doc spreadsheet called 'Cell Count Spreadsheet' (see
link below):

9\. Total cell number was:    720,000
