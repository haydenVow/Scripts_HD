Aim/Purpose


In previous e-stim experiments, we have seen issues with muscle maturing to a
degree where it bunched up and started delaminating from the cultureware. This
made it hard to properly analyze the results of the maturation study, because
mature muscle was aspirated during the washes and workflow steps that are part
of immuno-staining or ELISA. this study aims to investigate a range of
extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins enhancing cell adhesion to pre-coated
cultureware in order to counteract delamination after the maturation process
and enable backend analysis workflows


Hypothesis


We can identify a suitable ECM protein that encourages cell attachment,
prevents delamination of mature muscle and does not interfere with backend
analysis


Technical Gap


We have not previously trialed some of the compounds under investigation for
their effect on cell adhesion and none of them were investigate for
interference with our analysis assays


Method/Procedure


## Pre-coat cultureware surface with various ECM components to reduce
delamination issues:

  1. Fibrin - in-house
  2. Collagen - in-house (I believe?) --> PureCol, we have some leftovers and more coming
  3. laminin - in-house (I believe?)
  4. Matrigel - in-house (I believe?)
  5. Gelatin - in-house
  6. ECM - in-house
  7. MyoCult adhesion supplement - in-house
  8. Alginate hydrogel (as topical/capping layer after cell seeding)  




Experimental Schedule

(Assuming we have the required cell numbers ready to go) \--> one vial of
C2C12 has 500k cells, so we will just thaw whatever we need and kick this off
as soon as we have the plan approved

Laminin2502  
  
(Product No. L2020 Laminin from Engelbreth-Holm-Swarm murine sarcoma basement
membrane)-20 freezer

  1. Thaw laminin at 2 - 8 °C; avoid rapid thawing to prevent formation of a gel.
  2. Dilute 20x  (to ~50 ug/mL) in balanced salt solution. Solution concentration is dependent upon the application. A typical stock concentration is 0.01%.
  3. Coat culture surface with a minimal volume (0.5mL)
  4. Once the entire area is covered, remove excess solution. This can be used to coat another well/plate.
  5. Incubate at 37°C for 30 minutes
  6. Wash 3 times with PBS or DMEM before plating cells
  7. Air dry at least for 45 minutes before introducing cells and medium.

Collagen (PureCol)3850E6 components fridge, top row (-20 fridge)

  1. dilute stock 5-fold on ice
  2. add 0.5 mL per well
  3. place plate in inc. 37C for 30 min

Gelatin7508We also made up fresh gelatin yesterday, so can possibly borrow
from cell expansion fridge (Mix 7508)

  1. add 0.5 mL of 0.1% gelatin per well
  2. place plate in inc. 37C for 30 min
  3. remove gelatin and seed cells

  
41  
ECM3849E6 components fridge, top row (-20 fridge)

  1. Gel should be thawed overnight at 2-8°C before use and dispensed to a multiwell plate using a plate and pipettes that are pre-cooled to 2-8°C. 
  2. The gel may also be diluted up to twofold with 2-8°C Dulbecco′s Modified Eagle′s Medium, and should be done before gel is added to the plate. 
  3. The product will gel within 5 minutes at 20°C. For prolonged manipulations, work should be conducted below 10°C. 
  4. Cells can be plated on top of a thin gel layer of 0.5 mm

  1. coating with fibrinogen (8mg/mL) diluted in well 1-1 with 100mM Calcium
  2. incubate at 37C for 30 min and remove excess
  3. dry for 45 min before plating cells

  1. add 50 μL of MyoCult™-SF Attachment Substrate to 2.45 mL of D-PBS.
  2. add 500 uL per 12wp well
  3. Seal cultureware to avoid evaporation (e.g. using Parafilm®). Incubate at 2 ­ 8°C overnight
  4. Immediately prior to plating cells, gently tilt the cultureware onto one side and allow the excess substrate solution to collect at the edge.
  5. Remove the excess solution using a serological pipette or by aspiration.

  4. add GM and continue incubation


  
  
Cell and Media Requirements

Seeding Density

at cell seeding density of 60-80k per well with 21 wells (7 coatings) to seed
we need to thaw a total of 3 vials of C2C12s (assuming each vial has 500k
cells)

  

Media Requirements:

Growth media for seeding and proliferation stage

Number of plates = 2

Number of wells = 12

Seeding = 1 mL per well (100%)

Day 1 100% feed

Day 2 50% feed

Total volume required for seeding and initial feeds = 2 x 12 x 2.5 = 60 mL
(includes overage)

  

E6 media for DIFF process

Number of diff days = 6

Volume for 2 x 12 well plates = 24 mL/day

Total volume of E6 diff media required (without excess) = 6 x 24  = 144 mL
(150 mL)
