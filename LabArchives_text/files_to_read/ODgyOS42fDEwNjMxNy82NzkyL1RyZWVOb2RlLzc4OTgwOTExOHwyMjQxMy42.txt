Feed:

  1. Aliquotted   30mL  mL of  suspension growth Media 
  2. Placed in bead bath   9:.30 a/pm 
  3. Removed cultures from the incubator and placed in the BSC,
  4. Removed 100uL from each culture and transferred to separate wells on a 96 well plate for cell counting procedure (see details below) 
  5. added 10mL of DPBS to each tube to make total volumes up to 15mL (easier to pellet cell suspensions in 50mL tubes this way)
  6. centrifuged cell suspensions at 300g for 5 minutes,
  7. aspirated and discarded supernatant, replaced with  1 mL of media per tube.
  8. Transferred each cell suspension into a separate, new 50mL bioreactor tube.
  9. Topped each suspension back to 5mL using remaining suspension growth media.
  10. Returned vessel to incubate at 30 degrees, 5% CO2 shaking at 206 rpm, incubator 140




Cell counting procedure:

  1. Moved the 96 well plate containing samples to the main lab 
  2. Added 100uL of dPBS containing a 1:10 dilution of Hoechst 33342 stain




### Observations/Summary:

No aggregates were observed in the cell suspensions
