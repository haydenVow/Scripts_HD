Fix, DAPI & Image 96-well-plate (4)


Procedure

Fixing & Staining ( ~ 45-50min)

  1. Phase image all wells using miacapture.
  2. Removed media from each well and gently wash twice with 200uL PBS. 
  3. Added 100uL/well PFA for 15 min.   

  4. Removed PFA (use PFA waste container) and wash wells with 100uL PBS for 5 mins.
  5. Stain cells with 100uL DAPI (diluted 1:1000 in dPBS) for 5 mins.   

  6. Wash cells three times with 100uL dPBS for 5 mins each. 
  7. Remove last wash and Add 100uL dPBS per well
  8. Image cells using the Zaber for DAPI
  9. Parafilm plate, cover with foil and store in the fridge.


Passage 2 (Continuous Culture)


### Procedure

### Cell Harvest

  1. Turn on water bath and set temperature to 37C.
  2. Place new seeding flasks into the 37'C incubator to pre-warm.
  3. Take the flasks for harvest and observe under the microscope at 4x objective for even cell distribution . Refer to VSOP-006. Take 2-3 images per flask.
  4. Aliquot required volume of dPBS (37C), dPBS (ambient temp), TrypLE, and Growth Media in separate sterile pots. Refer to Table above for required volume.
  5. Place aliquots in pre-warmed water bath and leave for ~20 minutes or until warmed. Note: Ensure TrypLE is thoroughly warmed.``  

  6. Transfer aliquots and flasks required for harvest into the BSC.
  7. Discard growth media from each flask.
  8. Wash with warmed dPBS, then discard.
  9. Add TrypLE to each of the flasks. Mix thoroughly to ensure coverage of the surface area.
  10. Place in the incubator at 37C. After 8-10 minutes, remove flasks and observe for 95-100% dissociation of cells. Incubate further until maximum dissociation level is reached.  
     NOTE: The flasks must be removed from the incubator within 18 minutes of initial incubation of TrypLE containing flasks.``
  11. Aspirate the TrypLE solution and collect into 50mL centrifuge tubes(labelled).
  12. Using a serological pipette, dispense ambient temperature dPBS to create a final wash for each of the flasks. To effectively remove remaining cells adhered to the gelatin coated flasks,  aspirate the dPBS and resuspend into the the flask 2-3 times before collecting and combining the entire volume into the centrifuge tubes.
  13. Centrifuge at 650 x g for 5 minutes.````
  14. Gently remove centrifuge tubes from the machine, ensuring not to disturb the suspended pellets. Aspirate the supernatant from the tubes. Discard supernatant. Remove as much remaining supernatant with a 1mL pipette.  
Cells are now harvested.  

###  

### Cell Count

  1. Following cell harvest and centrifugation, re-suspend the cell pellets. Use the table below to provide a rough estimation of the resuspension volume required.
  2. Perform cell count (Refer to VSOP-007) and enter details into Production Cell Count Calculator: VBLT-001

  

### Cell Seeding

  1. Triturate the obtained cell suspension 10 times using a 5mL serological pipette to ensure a homogeneous cell suspension is obtained.
  2. Determine the required volume of suspension media (to achieve seeding density of about 7000 cells/cm2)  and dispense into pre-aliquoted growth media. Use Production Cell Count Calculator: VBLT-001, and record the values in the table above. 
  3. Transfer flasks from the incubator into the BSC.
  4. Transfer required growth media + cells into each flask.``  

  5. Repeat the above step as many times as required until all flasks have been seeded with the media+cells.
  6. Transfer the flasks into the 37C incubator. Refer to Appendix 3 for incubation conditions.
