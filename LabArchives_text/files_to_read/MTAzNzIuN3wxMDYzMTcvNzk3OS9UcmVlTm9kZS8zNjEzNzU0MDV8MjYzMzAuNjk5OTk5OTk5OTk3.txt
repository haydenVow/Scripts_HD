Process
  
  
Made up 8 x 500 mL media aliquots as follows:  
  
1\. HEK HD complete medium (Part A + B)

  1. Dissolve 8.4g of HEK basal medium (Part A) in 450mL cell culture grade water. 
  2. While stirring, add 1.55g of sodium bicarbonate into the 450 mL of cell culture grade water.                                                 
  3. While stirring, add 438mg of L-Glutamine powder into the 450mL of cell culture grade water.                                                  
  4. In the meantime, reconstitute lyophilised growth supplement (Part B) in 10 ml of cell culture grade water (total volume was 16 mL as when thawed, Part B added to the total volume).

  5. Mix gently by pipetting up and down until Part B is completely dissolved in water.

  6. Add 8mL of Part B into Part A.

  7. Adjust the pH to 7.1 (added 3 mL of 0.1M HCl).

  8. Add 39 ml of cell culture grade water to make up a total of 500mL of medium.

  9. Sterile filter (membrane filter with porosity of 0.22 micron or less).

  10. Store in the fridge until use

2\. 90/10 RPMI + Part B/HEK HD complete medium (Part A + B)  
  
     1\. Add 50 ml of the medium prepared above to 450 ml of RPMI. I then had to add an extra 7.2 mL of growth supplement (Part B) to my media once I had mixed it up to account for the use of plain RPMI and 720 uL of the complete medium in order to maintain the 90/10 ratio.  
  

3\. HEK HD basal medium (Part A) + Nuvonis

 HEK HD basal medium (Part A):

  1. Dissolve 8.4g of HEK HD basal medium (Part A) in 450mL cell culture grade water.
  2. While stirring, add 1.55g of sodium bicarbonate into the 450 mL of cell culture grade water.                                               
  3. While stirring, add 438mg of L-Glutamine powder into the 450mL of cell culture grade water.  
  4. Adjust the pH to 7.1 (added 6 mL of 0.1M HCl).
  5. Add 44 ml of cell culture grade water to make up a total of 500mL of medium.

  6. Sterile filter (membrane filter with porosity of 0.22 micron or less).

  7. Remove 6.6 mL of basal medium from the storage container, and add the following amounts of Nuvonis ingredients:

4\. 90/10 RPMI + Nuvonis/HEK HD basal medium (Part A) + Nuvonis  
  
      1\. Add 50 ml of the medium prepared above to 450 ml of RPMI.  

5\. CHO HD complete medium (Part A + B)

Part A

  1. Resuspend 10.95g of Part A in 450ml (21.9g/L) tissue culture grade water with constant stirring until powder is completely dissolved. Do not heat the water.

  2. Add 0.8g of sodium bicarbonate powder (1.6g/L) and stir until dissolved. 

  3. Adjust the pH to the desired pH using 1N HCl (83.3 g/L) or 1N NaOH (40 g/L).

    1. Added 1 mL x 1M NaOH to bring pH from 7.1 to 7.2  

  4. Make up the volume to 500ml with tissue culture grade water (added 49 mL of MQW).  

  5. Sterile filter (membrane filter with porosity of 0.22 micron or less).  

Complete medium (Part A + Part B)  

  1. Thaw the growth supplement (Part B) overnight at 2-8 degrees Celsius.

  2. Transfer half the content of one bottle of Part B (325 mL to the eye) to 500 mL of basal medium (Part A) under aseptic conditions and swirl gently to mix. Avoid repeated freeze thawing of Part B.

  3. Store the complete medium in the fridge until use  
  
*Note: Part B total volume: 610 mL  
  

6\. 90/10 RPMI + Part B/CHO HD complete medium (Part A + B)
