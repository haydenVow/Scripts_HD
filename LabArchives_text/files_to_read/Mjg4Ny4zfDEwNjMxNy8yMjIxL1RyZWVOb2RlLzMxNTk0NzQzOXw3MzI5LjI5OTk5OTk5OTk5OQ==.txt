## Performed by: LL




Process:

2 x 0.5 ml media aliquots in 15 ml falcon tubes should be stored in library
lab (top fridge, 104). Labelled 'E6' and 'HS' on the lids, with 'M5621' and
'M5704' respectively on the side. Also labelled 'JB'. The plate is stored on
the top shelf of incubator 77 in library lab.

1\. Aliquotted   0.5 mL  mL of E6 media into   1 x 15mL   tube and aliquotted
0.5 mL  mL of  HS media into   1 x 15mL tube. Stored in the fridge 105.

2\. Placed both tubes in water bath. 12:32

3\. Removed  100  % of Growth Media from vessel. 13:22

4\. Replaced with  150 uL (per well/per vessel) of  Diff   media.

5\. Returned vessel to incubate at  13:23

  * [X]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (aviary cells)
