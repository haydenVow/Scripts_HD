Background

Cell counting is an ongoing issue for suspension adaptation experiments where
cell densities are low, and we cant afford to sacrifice too many cells for
counting. The CCK8 colorimetric assay which is designed to quantify cells at
low numbers/density and may offer an alternative to traditional cell counts.

Here we will trial the assay in order to determine it's upper and lower limits
of cell quantification, and to establish a standard curve using our embryonic
cells. We will also look to see if there is a high degree of variability
between cell lines. Lines to be trialed are the Nuvonis Quail as well as our
own KHAKIO and MUSCO duck lines.
