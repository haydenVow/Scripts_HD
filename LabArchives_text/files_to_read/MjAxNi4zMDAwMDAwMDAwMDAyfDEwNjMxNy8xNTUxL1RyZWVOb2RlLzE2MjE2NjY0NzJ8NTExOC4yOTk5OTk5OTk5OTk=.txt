Aim/Purpose : To adapt fibroblast to ACF media
Hypothesis: We hypothesise that E8 + fibroblast goodies and the fibrolife ACF media formulations will both support fibroblast growth
Technical Gap: We have not achieved more than 2 fibroblast doublings in ACF at Vow.
Method/Procedure: See below.


In advance: Generate 40mL of each Growth Media:

Fibroblife media replicate: (see calculator)  
DMEM/F12 basal media  
50ug/mL LAA2P (100mg/mL) 1:2000 dilution (0.02mL = 20µL)  
5ng/mL FGF (25ug/mL stock)  1:5000 dilution) (0.008mL = 8µL)  
5ug/mL Insulin  
5ng/mL EGF (0.1mg in 1mL dPBS (14.28uM conc.)  1:2000 dilution) (0.02mL =
20µL)  
30pg/mL TGFb (2ug/mL) 1:66,666 dilution (0.0006mL = 0.6µL)  
  
500ug/mL albumin (ID 1803) (200000ug/mL 1:4 dilution) (

  
0.6uM Linolic acid L1376-5G      stock 0.92g/mL  

  * Molecular Weight 280.45



  
L-glutamine (7.5mM)  
1X P/S Antibiotics

  

E8+ goodies

  

E8 basal media  
150ug/mL albumin  
5ng/mL PDGF  
7nM IGF-1  
1:800 Protease Inhibitors  
1:100 concentrated lipids  

  

Serum control

DMEM/F12 + 20% FBS + 1X P/S

  

[Day 1] - Thaw 1 x vial of DOLLY12 fibroblast WCB into 1 x T175 using DMEM/F12
+ 20% FBS + 1x PS.

[Day 2] \- 50% feed of revived cells with DMEM/F12+20%FBS+1xPS

[Day 4] \- Passage DOLLY12 fibroblasts to 3 x T75s. Perform a cell count and
subculture at 7k cells per cm2.

[Day 5] \- 100% feed all flasks with the following conditions: DMEM/F12+10%FBS
(control), Fibrolife media, E8 + fibroblast goodies.

Fibroblast goodies = 150ug/mL albumin, 15ng/mL PDGF + 7nM IGF1 + protease
inhibitors + 1:100 dilution of concentrated lipids.

  

Keep cells in culture until 10 doublings are reached.

  1. Every ~3 days, perform a 50% feed.
  2. Passage when the cells get close to 100% confluent.
  3. Perform a cell count each time and track the number of doublings. 
  4. Monitor cell morphology and the speed of doublings over time.
  5. When 10 doublings is achieved or when the cells stop dividing, the experiment can be concluded.
  6. It is only critical to keep 1 flask of cells in each media condition; the other cells can be discarded or used for other experiments.
