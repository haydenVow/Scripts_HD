Preparation:

Make up the following Media if not already made:

  * [x]  E6 + 1xP/S 
  * [x]  DMEM/F12 + 2% HS + 1xP/S 

### Process:

  1. Inspect 3 plates under the axio, 5x objective, phase and capture and image of all wells for each plate.
  2. Proceed with Diff feed below on three plates
  3. Warm up 1 x 1 mL of E6 Media and 1 x 1 mL of HS Diff media in the waterbath for 15 minutes  `| 16:54 - 17:00 |`
  4. Transfer the media to a reservoir in the BSC before feeding for easy handling using the multichannel pipette.

For WELLS IN ROW B: Aspirate from all wells (horizontally).

  1. Removed  `100` % of supernatant from plate(s). (aspirate only until there is slightly enough liquid to cover the base of the well instead of the whole 100uL to avoid leaving the cells to dry).
  2. Replaced with  `0.1` mL (per well/per flask) of  `DMEM/F12 + 2% HS + 1X P/S Diff`  media to  of each plate. Use fresh tips only in the new media.

For WELLS IN ROW C: Aspirate from wells (horizontally)

  1. Removed  `100` % of supernatant from plate(s). (aspirate only until there is slightly enough liquid to cover the base of the well instead of the whole 100uL to avoid leaving the cells to dry).
  2. Replaced with  `0.1` mL (per well) of  `E6 Diff`  media of each plate. use fresh tips only in the new media.
  3. Returned flask to incubate at: 17:15
    * [x]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
    * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (aviary cells)
