Reagent preperation

1\. Aliquotted   600mL  mL of  E6. Placed in water bath   10:38 am - 11:41 am




Cell factory Process

  1. Unscrew white cap and remove blue cap and place aside.
  2. Removed   100%    of supernatant from vessel by carefully pouring into a waste container with volume markings.
  3. Replaced with        600   mL  (per flask) of  `growth` media by carefully pouring media through the white cap opening
  4. Place caps back and equalise cell factory by placing it on its side (blue cap on the bottom and white cap on the top, see image below:)  
  

4\. Returned vessel to incubate at:

  * [x]  37ºC, @ 12:03 pm 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (aviary cells)

  

  * [x]   Incubator:    CONTHERM       
  * [ ]  Top Sanyo Incubator (ID #25)
  * [ ]  Bottom Sanyo Incubator
  * [ ]  Top Binder Incubator
  * [ ]  Bottom Binder Incubator
