Prepare materials for thaw and seed:

2\. Aliquotted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then
placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath for a minimum of 20 minutes
prior to use:

  *  Growth media (for seeding):    300 mL 
  * Time that aliquot was placed in the water bath to warm before use:   10:00 a/pm 

  




## Thaw and seed vial:

3\. Collected the cryovial from Liquid Nitrogen storage & place in foam
floater in water bath for 5 min  13:01 - 13:04 a/pm

Location where cryovial was collected from:

Vial details:  6   x  2M  cryovials at  2M  cells each for a total of    12M
cells

Brew

Tower/Bucket #5  

Box/Cane #4  

`4. Ethanol sprayed & transferred the vial(s) to the BSC.`

`5.  resuspended the cell suspension gently to reduce osmotic shock. `

`6. Collected the entire 1mL of cell suspension & transfer into the pre-warmed
tube of Growth Media. `

`7. Using a 10mL serological pipette, resuspended & distributed the cells
evenly in the   300mL of pre-warmed Growth Media (prepared in Step 2). `

`8. Transfered   300mL to each pre-coated  2CF  flask/well`

`9. Transfered flask/plate(s) to incubate at: `

  * [X]  30ºC, 5% CO2 (reptile cells)
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (aviary cells)

  

Making labels

Note - You will need to increase the passage number by one. (i.e. if your
thawed vial ID has a passage number of 3, when you make a culture ID for you
vessel you will need change the passage number to 4 on Airtable.)
