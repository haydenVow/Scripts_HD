Perform bank using below volumes

  




## Performed by: Bonnie Tangey




Observation of DUCKEYE prior to bank.

DUCKEYE culture was 80-90% confluent. Cells have fibroblastic morphology.




Process

 1\. Aliquoted reagents and placed in the water bath for a minimum of 20
minutes prior to use:

  1.  TrypLE: 5mL 
  2. dPBS (for washing and neutralising)   10mL 
  3. Media (for pellet resuspension):   5mL gerowth media




2\. Washed the flask(s) with dPBS.

3\. Added | 5 |mL tryple to each vessel/well and incubated at 37ºC for |
10min| min

4\. Neutralised with |5mL  | dPBS (warmed) and combined cell suspension into a
|50mL| tube

5\. Centrifuged at 650 x g for 5 min  




6\. Aspirated the supernatant(s).

7\. Resuspend pellet(s) in |5 |mL |growth| medias.

8\. Performed a cell count using the haemocytometer and recorded the cell
count data in the Google Doc spreadsheet called 'Cell Count Spreadsheet' (see
link below):

SSIBtIylyrBQE5kRX5Z8NtI/edit#gid=0

9\. Total cell number was: | 9.4M (KINGO),  |

10\. Calculate the required volume cell suspension & freeze medium to generate
a concentration of ~1M cells/mL.




Note

It took approx 25 min for the HORNK culture to trypilise while the others were
fully disassociated in 10min




11\. Centrifuged cells at 650 x g for 5 min.

12\. Aspirated supernatant carefully, taking care not to disturb the pellet.

13\. Resuspended the pellet in | 16.8 |mL CRYOSTORCS10

14\. Aliquoted | 1000/vial |µL into | 16 | x cryovials (already labelled).

15\. Tightened the lids & transfer the cryovials to a Mr. Frosty immediately
into the -80ºC freezer.

  * [x]  With foam
  * [ ]  Without foam
  * [ ]  1st Freeze
  * [x]  2nd Freeze
  * [ ]  3rd Freeze
  * [ ]  4th Freeze
  * [ ]  5th Freeze

17\. Allow the cells to freeze for at least 18-24 hours before transferring to
Liquid Nitrogen storage.
