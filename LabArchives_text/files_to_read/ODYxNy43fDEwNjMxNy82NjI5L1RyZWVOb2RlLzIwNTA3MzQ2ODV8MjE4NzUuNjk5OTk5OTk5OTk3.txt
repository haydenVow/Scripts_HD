Prepare materials for thaw and seed

1\. Aliquoted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then
placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath

  * Growth medium (for seeding): 60 mL  




## Thaw and seed vials:

2\. Collected the cryovial from Liquid Nitrogen storage & place in foam
floater in water bath for max 5 min 16:33 - 16:38  

Location where cryovial was collected from:

Vial details:   1   x   F_CHOMP07   cryovials at  2M  cells each for a total
of   2M  cells

Brew

Tower/Bucket #5  

Box/Cane #5  

Vial location: C4  

Vial ID(s): see table above

``3\. Ethanol sprayed & transferred the vial(s) to the BSC.

4\. Added 500 µL of Growth Media from "resuspension & cell count" growth
medium aliquot to the cryovial

5\. Mixed gently, then collected the entire cell suspension & transferred back
into the pre-warmed tube of growth medium.

8\. Added 2M cells to 60 mL growth medium aliquot and seeded [2] x [T175s]

9\. Transfered flask/plate(s) to incubate at:

  * [ ]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * [x]  30ºC, 5% CO2 (reptilian cells)
