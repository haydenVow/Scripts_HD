Experimental Plan

This will be a very basic check of cell survival post thaw, as well as cell
numbers at the 1st passage. 1x vial of 500,000 cells frozen in each of the 3
freeze medias will be thawed and cultured. Before plating, a cell count will
be performed to determine the number of cells seeded. Cells will be cultured
in DMEM/F12 +20% FBS +1x P/S at 30C, until approximately 70-90% confluent,
before passaging and counting cells. After the 1st passage, all cultures will
be combined so that the cells can be used in another experiment. See lab book
