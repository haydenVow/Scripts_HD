Process:

1\. Aliquotted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then
placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath for a minimum of 20 minutes
prior to use:

  1. TrypLE:    40   mL in  1 x 120 ml     tubes
  2. dPBS (for neutralising)   40   mL in  1 x 120 ml   tubes
  3. dPBS (for pellet resuspension):   40   mL in    1 x 120 ml    tubes
  4. Times that all aliquots were placed in the water bath to warm before use  10:45   

Note: if aliquots were placed in water bath at different times, record the
time stamp for each individual solution.




2\. Washed the flask(s) with dPBS.

3\. Added   10    mL tryple to each vessel/well and incubated at 37ËšC for   8
min.

Note: Fibroblasts typically require 15-18 minutes of incubation with tryple,
slightly longer than MuSCs.

  1. Start/Finish time for tryple was   11:04    \-    11:12   am

4\. Neutralised with   10    dPBS (warmed) and combined cell suspension into
2 x 50 ml   tube.

5\. Centrifuged at 400 x g for 5 min

  1. Start/Finish time for centrifugation was    11:25    \-    11:28  am 




6\. Aspirated the supernatant(s)

7\. Resuspended pellet(s) in     20   mL    dPBS  

8\. Performed a cell count using the haemocytometer and recorded the cell
count data in widget or the Google Doc spreadsheet called 'Cell Count
Spreadsheet' (see link below):

9\. Total cell number was:   22,800,000  

10\. Centrifuged and aspirated the dPBS carefully, making sure not to disturb
the cell pellet.

11\. Resuspended the cell pellet in 5 ml of  pre-warmed growth media.

10\. Aliquotted  288 uL of cell suspension (seeded at 7500 cells/cm2) into
each 30 ml of pre-warmed growth media previously aliquotted in 4 x 120ml pots.

11\. Transferred each of the 30ml cell suspension into 1 x T175, having a
total of 4 x T175.

12\. Placed into incubator 140 in Library Lab.

Relevant Images/Figures (if applicable):

Images were captured on the 31 of March 2022 of two flasks prior to passage,
cells appeared 100% confluent with minimal peeling from the base of the flask.
