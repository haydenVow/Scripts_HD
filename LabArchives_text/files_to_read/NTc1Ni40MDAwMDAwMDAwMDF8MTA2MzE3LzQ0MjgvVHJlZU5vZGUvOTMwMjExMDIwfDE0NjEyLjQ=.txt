In addition to feeding the plates, 200 mL of E6 (of which 105 mL was for
Shaleen's experiment) and 100 mL of 2% Horse Serum media was made up.

The required amounts of E6 ingredients were derived from the E6/E8 calculator
spreadsheet and comprised of DMEM / F12 + 1X P/S + sodium bicarbonate + sodium
selenium + insulin + transferrin + LAA2P.

2% HS (2 mL) was added to 98 mL of basal media (equal parts of DMEM/F12).




Process:

  1. Aliquotted  40 mL  mL of  _Growth_ Media (for both Eva and Addy's experiment)
  2. Added   20 uL  mL of p38i. 
  3. Placed in water bath 2:03-3:45 pm 
  4. Removed  50  % of supernatant from vessel. 
  5. Replaced with  100 uL  (per well) of  Growth  media. 
  6. Returned vessel to incubate at:

  * [ X ]  37ºC @ 4:30 pm, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (aviary cells)

  

  * Incubator (# 52), Lab [Main]




### Observations/Summary:
