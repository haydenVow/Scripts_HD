Process:

  1. Aliquoted:
    1. 1.5 mL  of  each of the growth media conditions above   

    2. 15 mL of DMEM/F12 + 10% FBS + 1X P/S 
    3. 15 mL of GM + HDAC 1 (0.1ug/mL)  

    4. 15 mL of GM + HDAC 2 (0.1ug/mL)  
Placed in water bath: 12:00  

  2. Collected culture vessels from shakers, wiped with ethanol-sprayed cloth and brought into BSC (if necessary, paused shakers by pressing the "play" button on the controller on the side wall of the incubator)
    1. E125s timestamp: 15:35
    2. 50 mL tubes timestamp: 16:11
  3. Using a p1000 for the 6-well plate cultures and a 5 mL serelogical pipette for the E125 flasks, gently pipette-mixed cultures for ~1 minute to break up cell clumps
  4. Pipetted suspensions though 70 um cell strainer into ~~  8 x 15 mL tubes  and ~~3 x 50 mL flasks (keep E125 flask and 6-well plates in BSC as cultures will be returned to these post centrifugation) 
  5. Centrifuged at 300 x g for 5 min.
    1. E125s Timestamp:15:45 - 15:50       

    2. 6 wps timestamp:  16:23 - 16:28
  6. Aspirated supernatants, taking care to not disrupt or aspirate pellet
  7. Re-suspended all cultures in 500 uL of their respective growth media. 
  8. Took 1 x 20 uL aliquots from all cultures and performed cell count, recording counts in this spreadsheet https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1YuTvXJXQQMIMwRZGeqNjdi20WeURg5FpM-1TJ-zrb1c/edit#gid=787099888
  9. Replaced fresh, warmed media in all cultures 
  10. Gently pipette-mixed cultures again before moving back to E125 flask and 2 x 6-well plates 
  11. Returned vessels to incubator and replaced in clamp. If shaker was paused, remembered to press play to restart shaking. 6-well plates should be shaking at 150 RPM and E125 at 120 RPM)
    1. Timestamp 6 wp:     17:05     

    2. Timestamp E125:    16:05      

  * Incubator (#116 & #81), Lab [Main]




Stain and image:

  1. Took 100 uL samples of each culture, transferred to wells in 96 well plate
  2. Prepared two stain buffers of:
    1. 1 mL dPBS and 5 drops Hoechst  
    2. 1 mL dPBS and 5 drops NucGreen  
  3. Added 20 uL of Hoechst stain buffer to each well, pipet mixed each well
  4. Incubated at room temperature in the dark for 10 minutes  17:07 - 17:19    

  5. Added 20 uL of NucGreen stain buffer to each well, pipet mixed each well
  6. Incubated at room temperature in the dark for 10 minutes   17:20 - 17:30    

  7. Centrifuged at 650 RCF for 1 minute  

  8. Took images of each well on the blue and green fluorescence channels using the Zaber on  Culture ID 7742  
  9. Plate setup was as follows:
    1. Row A:
      1. serum control E125
      2. HDAC 1 E125
      3. HDAC 2 E125
      4. BLANK WELL (not imaged) 
      5. Serum control shake tube
