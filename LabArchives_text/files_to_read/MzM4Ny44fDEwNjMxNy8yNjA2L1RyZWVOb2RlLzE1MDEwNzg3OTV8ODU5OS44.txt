RELATED TO MILESTONE:  Q3 KR1, increase myosin expression by 2x

AIM/PURPOSE: To build infrastructure allowing us to expose cells safely to
electrical stimulation patterns at high throughput

HYPOTHESIS: We can control and measure the electrical stimulation patterns
that we are subjecting our cells to, in order to interpret biological results
correctly. The electrical stimulation is at a level where is does not diminish
the quality of the media or damage the stimulation infrastructure.

RESULTS SUMMARY:

see report

CONCLUSIONS: A sterilizable electrical stimulation system was built that
allows Vow to expose cells to multiple kinds of electrical stimulation pattern
(DC and biphasic) without causing electrolysis or obvious damage to the
infrastructure. In addition to a home-built e-stim electrode platelid, a
suitable commercial system (StimJim) was identified, characterized and
tailored to our specific needs (modifying firmware code to allow for
continuous stimulation)

NEXT STEPS:

  * Test with cells to identify suitable voltages to support maturation
  * Contemplate use of Platinum electrodes.
  * Purchase Pulse Pal 2 (to allow for work-rest patterns)
