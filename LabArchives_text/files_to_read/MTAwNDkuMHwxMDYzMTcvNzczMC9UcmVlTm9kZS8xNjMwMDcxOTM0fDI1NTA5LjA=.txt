Aim/Purpose


To perform a 12-factor DSD to determine the impact of 12 media ingredients on
the growth of Nuvonis suspension cells


Hypothesis


We hypothesise that >1 ingredient at the levels tested will have a
significantly positive impact on Y cell growth


Technical Gap


We have seen that Nuvonis cells can grow in a 90/10 RPMI/HyCell ratio +
Nuvonis additives when supplemented with 3mg/mL yeast, 0.06mg/mL putrescine
dihydrochloride and 0.0001mg/mL FGF-B. We want to try growing the cells in a
100% RPMI mix (no HyCell) with a range of factors aimed to replace the lost
HyCell nutrients.


Method/Procedure


  1. D0: Prepare working stocks of each factor 
  2. D0: Perform media mixing on OT2 to generate media conditions. Mix control media conditions manually. 
  3. D0: Add media to plates on OT2 and seed cells manually 
  4. D0: Image plates on Zaber (phase, 5X)
  5. D2: Image plates on Zaber (phase, 5X)
  6. D5: Perform live/dead stain on OT2.
  7. D5: Image plates on Zaber (phase + AF488 + DAPI, 5X)
  8. D5: Run images through Mia Analysis macro for suspension cells 
  9. D6: Export macro output to spreadsheets to determine cells/mL. Perform statistical analysis in Prism and JMP.
