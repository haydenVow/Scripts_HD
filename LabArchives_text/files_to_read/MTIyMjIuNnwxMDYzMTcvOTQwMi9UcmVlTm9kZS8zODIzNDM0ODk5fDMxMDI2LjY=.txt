Clone from round 9 are now being managed in this section of lab archives




Clones C/E6 (WT)(ID13420) and C/C72 (CDKN1B)(ID13415) were passaged from a
T175  
  
Briefly.

  1. Cultures were imaged using the Primovert microscope under 10x objective, PHASE imaging. Images were inspected manually for a confluence estimate. Wells that appeared to have >80% confluence were selected for continuous passaging https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1yQD_JrhzktpQd0vaCt2B5OskKgl9SipLLab3WZ9v7ZU/edit#gid=1517361241&range=252:255
  2. Media was aspirated from plates
  3. Wells were washed with 15 mL PBS
  4. Wash was removed and cells were covered with 15mL of Tryple. 
  5. Cells were left to incubate for 10-12 minutes at 30 degrees, 5% CO2. 
  6. Tryple volume from each well was then transferred to a 50mL tube and cells were neutralised with 15mL of dPBS.
  7. Cells were spun down at 600g for 5 minutes. 
  8. Supernatant was removed and cells were resuspended in 5mL of growth media (DMEM/F12 + 20% FBS + 1xP/S).
  9. Cells were counted:

  10. Cells were then plated back into individual T175 flasks. 
  11. The new cultures were returned to incubator 140.
