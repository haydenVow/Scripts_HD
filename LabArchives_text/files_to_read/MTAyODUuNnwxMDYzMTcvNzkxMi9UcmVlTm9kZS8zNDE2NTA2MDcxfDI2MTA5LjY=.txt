Plates 11416 and 11417 were removed from incubator 82 and transferred to the
Library lab.

Plates were imaged using the Larger Zaber 6 well plate imager using PHASE,
10ms exposure.

Images were used to generate a pick list based on confluence, wells with 50%
confluence were selected by eye:

Wells intended for passage were given a '1' on the pick list, while all other
wells were given a '0'
