Data

Data were collated in a google sheets doc. Mean values, variance, and SEM were
calculated for viable cell count (cells/mL) and % viable cells over time.

See graphs below

Cell counts increased over time while cell viability remained unchanged for
densities approaching 1 million cells per mL. Experiment was terminated before
cells reached densities beyond this.

pH appeared to decrease slightly as cell density approached 1 million cells
per mL. It should be noted that the accuracy of indicator strips is likely
variable and is not an objective measure. Care should be taken to carefully
monitor pH of cell densities greater than 1million/mL

Handover

This experiment was terminated (3/3/2022) early prior to completion due to
redundancy with other experiments carried out by Adrian Kotevski. See Lab
Archives entries here. Handover was completed via Slack with the following
suggestions made:

  * measure media pH by colour indicator strips
  * measure cell counts in triplicate to calculate variance/SEM
  * measure total dead cell count in addition to viable cells to determine % viable over time
  * only carry out 80% partial media changes rather than 100% media changes above cell densities of 1 million cells/mL (this better reflects limitations of bioreactor culture, where entire-volume media changes are not possible)
