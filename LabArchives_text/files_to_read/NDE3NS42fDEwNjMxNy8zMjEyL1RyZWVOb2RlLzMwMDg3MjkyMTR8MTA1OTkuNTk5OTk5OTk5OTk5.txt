1\. Prepared    100mL  PBST (0.2% Triton-X)

2\. Prepared    100mL  blocking buffer: PBST (0.1% Triton-X + PBS) + 3% bovine
serum albumin (BSA). (Kept in the fridge until needed in blocking step)

Process:

Fixing for both plates ( ~ 20 - 30 min):

  1.  Removed media from each well and wash with PBS twice. 
  2.  Added  100 µL PFA for 15 min:  11:43 - 11:58 pm 
  3. Removed PFA (and add in PFA waste container) and wash wells twice with   140 µL PBS. 

*From this point on, only Culture #7437  applies to the rest of the protocol. Culture #7438 , placed in fridge after fixing.

Permeabilise ( ~ 20 - 30 min)

1\. Removed PBS from each well.

2\. Added  100uL PBST (0.2% Triton-X) to each well for 15 min:  12:13 - 12:38
pm

3\. Aspirated PBST for each well.




Blocking ( ~ 1 hr)

1\. Added  100 µL of blocking buffer (3% BSA in PBST [0.1% Triton-X]) and
incubate for 45 minutes - 1hr at RT. (no more than 1 hour):   12:40 - 13:35
a/pm




Single/Simultaneous Primary Antibody staining ( ~ 10 minutes or 2hr)

1\. Removed blocking buffer from each well.

2\. Incubated cells with primary antibody for 90min - 2hrs at RT, or 4ºC
overnight:   13:36 - 15:19 a/pm

3\. Parafilmed plates and stored at 4ºC in tissue culture lab Fridge.

After this step, all further task should be performed in a dark room. The
vessel should also be wrapped foil when not used.




Observations/Summary:

### Both automation and manual plates fixed, manual plate stored in fridge.

Automation plate was primary stained as per plate map in experimental plan.
