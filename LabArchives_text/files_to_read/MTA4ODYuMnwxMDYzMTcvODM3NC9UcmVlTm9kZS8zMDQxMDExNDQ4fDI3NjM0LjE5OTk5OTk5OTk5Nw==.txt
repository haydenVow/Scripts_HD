Aim/Purpose


To assess which Agarose concentrations or combination will hold its shape and
be stable in 37 degrees for adherent scaffold work.


Hypothesis


Agarose will need to be mixed with other materials to hold its shape and be
stable in 37 degrees celsius.

Method/Procedure


## 1) Preparation of the Gels

Mix No.MixMeasurements with total 100g waterMethod  
1Agarose 3gMix Agarose in room temperature water. Heat Solution until agarose
is fully dissolved. Leave overnight to fully hydrate prior to filling moulds.  
2Agarose 2gMix Agarose in room temperature water. Heat Solution until agarose
is fully dissolved.Leave overnight to fully hydrate prior to filling moulds.  
3Agarose0.9Mix Agarose in room temperature water. Heat Solution until agarose
is fully dissolved.Leave overnight to fully hydrate prior to filling moulds.  
4Agarose + Alginate + Methyl cellulose +Maltodextrin0.9g+ 2.8g + 3g +3gMix all
powders except for MC and heat to 120 degrees for 20 mins. after cooling down
add MC to mixture and incubate for 2 hrs. Leave overnight to fully hydrate
prior to filling moulds.  
  
  

## 2) Place into moulds for casting

  

## 3) Results

Mix No.CommentsImage  
13% w/w Agarose gel was filled in a 3D printed (PLA) mould. This gel
concentration had great structural integrity and good resolution in comparison
to the other gels.  
2The 2% (w/w) Agarose was filled in a 3D printed (PLA) mould. The Agarose slid
out of the mould without any extra cutting out of the mould. The material is
soft but holds it shape.  
3The 0.9% (w/w) Agarose was filled in a 3D printed (PLA) mould. The gel did
not hold its shape in the mould and did not form a solid structure.  
4The Agarose + Alginate + Methyl cellulose +Maltodextrin mixed gel was put
into the mould.It did not hold its shape in the mould and out of it. The end
result looks like a clump, suggesting that this gel is not optimal for
casting.
