Procedure


PASSAGING OF NUCLEOFECTED CELLS

1\. Took 2 x images of each vessel with microscope on phase setting (4X to
assess confluence)

2\. Aliquoted the required volume of each reagent below, placed all aliquots
to warm in the bead bath for a minimum of 20 minutes prior to use:

  1. TrypLE:  2mL per well 
  2.  dPBS (for neutralising & washing):  4mL per well 

3\. Time that all aliquots were placed in the water bath the warm before use

Note: if aliquots were placed in water bath at different time, record the time
stamp for each individual solution.

Suspension cultures and adherent cultures were set up prior to 12pm by NH and
EC. Passage started at 10:44am. Cultures harvested for FACS sorting were
passaged after lunch by ST starting at 13:30

  * [EC] Control plates, IGFBP4 +ZIC1 (suspension and adherent culture setup)  

  * [NH] AQP1 + ZIC1, AQP1 + IGFBP4 (suspension and adherent culture setup)   

  * [ST]: 

The following passaging protocol was followed for each knockout/control group,
The supernatants from all wells was also collected at all steps prior to
centrifugation following neutralization of tryple. All conditions were kept in
separate tubes.

* * *

4\.  Collected culture supernatant and washed each well GENTLY with 2mL of
dPBS (warmed).  

5\. Collected dPBS wash with previous supernatant and added   2  mL tryple to
each well, cells were then incubated at 37˚C for 8 minutes.  

6\. Collected supernatants into 50mL tubes alongside previous supernatants and
empty wells were washed with 1.5 ml  of dPBS. dPBS washes were then also
collected.  

7\. Centrifuged collections at 400 x g for 5 min.  

8\. Aspirated and discarded the supernatant(s) from cell pellets.

9\. Using dPBS, Resuspended and combined pellets into one tube, taking care to
rinse out tubes with a small aliquot of dPBS. Total volumes of cell suspension
at this step for each cell pellet was 3mL.

10\. Aliquoted 10uL of cell suspension for counting using a hemocytometer,
mixing 1:5 with Trypan blue. *This step was not followed during FACS prep of
culture X , Cells were moved straight to FACS prep protocol after dPBS
resuspension.

11\. Cell suspensions were counted and total cell number was determined for
each group in the document below.

SETTING UP ADHERENT POOLED CULTURES

  1. 1.5mL tubes containing cells for adherent culture were centrifuged for 5 min at 300g. 
  2. Supernatant was removed and each pellet was resuspended in 1mL of DMEM/F12 + 20% FBS + 1xP/S growth media. 
  3. Each cell suspension was then transferred to a separate T75 flask containing 11mL of the same growth media. 
  4. Flasks were left to incubate at 30 degrees, 5% CO2 (incubator #68 ) static. 
  5. Flasks were later moved to the Main Lab. 

  




SETTING UP SUSPENSION POOLED CULTURES

  1. Once aliquots for adherent cultures and DNA extraction had been taken from the cell suspension, the remaining cells were centrifuged for 5 minutes at 400g. 
  2. Supernatant was removed from each tube and replaced with 5mL of Hycell Cho basal media + KSR + FGF-b + IGF1-LR3
  3. Cells from each condition were then resuspended and transferred to separate 50mL bioreactor tubes. 
  4. Tubes were placed in incubator 120 (main lab), at 30 degrees C, 5% CO2, shaking at 210 rpm

  




FACS SORTING SUSPENSION CELLS

  1. The collected cell suspension for each condition was transferred to a 1.5mL tube and centrifuged at 300g for 5 minutes. 
  2. Supernatant was removed. 
  3. Cells were resuspended in 500uL of FACS buffer 
  4. An esky box was packed for transport to the FACS facility 
    1. Pre-filled (medium) multi-well plates (8x96wp), parafilmed around the edges
    2. An ice pack
    3. Extra FACS Buffer prepared earlier. 
    4. 2x 0.22um filter capped tubes. 
  5. Once at the FACS facility: 
    1. Samples were passed though 0.22um filter lids into sample collection tubes
    2. A live dead stain was added to each of the sample tubes, 5uL of 7-AAD stain (invitrogen) 
    3. Cells from each condition were sorted into 3/2.5 x 96 well plates each containing suspension adapted media AND 1x 96 well plate containing adherent growth media, 1 cell per well (see FACS preparation for media compositions). 
      1. IGFBP4 + ZIC1 were the only conditions to receive 3 x96 well plates containing suspension adapated media. The other conditions (IGFBP4 + AQP1 and AQP1 + ZIC1) were only sorted into 2.5x 96 well plates containing suspension adapted media.
  6. Plates were transported back to Vow and moved directly to the incubator at 30 degrees, 5% CO2 (Incubator number #120 ), plates were left unlabelled as labelling system was down, plates were labelled on the lid with the knockout condition. 




FREEZING PELLETS FOR DNA EXTRACTION

  1. Added an additional 400uL of dPBS to each aliquot of cells taken for DNA extraction. 
  2. Centrifuged tubes at 300g for 5 minutes to pellet cells. 
  3. Removed supernatant from each tube then added all tubes to a yellow lid pot labelled with the epic number and date. 
  4. Stored cell pellets at −20°C in the bottom shelf of the freezer in library lab. 

  

  




## Observations

There was no obvious mophological differences between the control group and
each of the knockout groups when inspecting the cells down the microscope
prior to passage.




## Reference Images.

Images were taken from one plate of each sample group.
