Plates 11473-11476 were removed from incubator 140 and imaged using the
multiplate Zaber system in library lab.

Images were captured under 4x objective using PHASE imaging, exposure time
10ms. See MIA entry for images.

Plate were then returned to the incubator (30 degrees, 5% CO2).

Images were inspected manually for cell confluence above 50%.

These wells were selected into a picklist which will determine the automated
opentron passaging protocol.
