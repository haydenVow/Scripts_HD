Process:

  1. Aliquotted   75  mL of  Growth Media 
  2. Placed in water bath 11:20 am - 12:11 pm 
  3. Removed   50 % of supernatant from vessel. 
  4. Replaced with 15 mL (per well/per vessel) of   growth  media. 
  5. Returned vessel to incubate at: 10:25 am

  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (aviary cells)
  * [ X] 30ºC, 5% CO2 (reptilian cells)

### Observations/Summary:

50  % media changed on vessel(s)

Did not change pipettes between removing 15 ml of waste media from control
T175 flask and ZIC1 T175 flask. I removed the waste media from the control
flask first and then from the ZIC1 flask, so it shouldn't have any significant
impact on the cell type, given these adherent flasks are pooled populations of
cells and we already assume all of them have not been nucleofected (there are
likely some WT cells in the ZIC1 flask already!).
