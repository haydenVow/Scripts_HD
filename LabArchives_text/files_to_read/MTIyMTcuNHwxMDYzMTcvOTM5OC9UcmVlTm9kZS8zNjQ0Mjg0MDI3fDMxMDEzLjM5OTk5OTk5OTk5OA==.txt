Process:  

  1. Aliquoted Nuvonis suspension media (without growth factors) into a urine jar 
  2. In the BSC, added 10ng/mL EGF, 50ng/mL IGF LR3 and 10ng/mL FGF2 to the urine jar. 
  3. Placed in the water bath and warm to 37C 
  4. Collected vessels from shaker, and transferred to the BSC
  5. transferred contents of the flask to 50mL falcon tubes
  6. Centrifuged for 5min at 400RPM
  7. Aspirated and discarded 90% spent media from each tube 
  8. Re-suspended cell pellets in Complete Nuvonis Suspension Media (including growth factors) and combined 
  9. Took aliquots to perform cell counts.
  10. Performed trypan blue staining and manual counting with a haemocytometer,  see here https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1DPzKubYxfHmWogVPihC-SSIBtIylyrBQE5kRX5Z8NtI/edit#gid=0
  11. Added transferred cell suspensions back to their original flasks, along with  additional Complete Nuvonis Suspension Media (including growth factors) or Nuvonis media + OptiPro. 
  12. Returned to incubator 77, library lab, 37C, 5% CO2, shaking at 190RPM
