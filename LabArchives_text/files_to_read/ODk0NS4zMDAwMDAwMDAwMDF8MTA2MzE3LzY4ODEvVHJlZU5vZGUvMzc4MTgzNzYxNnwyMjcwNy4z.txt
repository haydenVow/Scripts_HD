Calibrated the pH probe

  1. Gathered 2 reference buffers (preferably pH 7 and pH 10, pH 4 can also be used) in small beakers (ideally a 50 mL falcon tube with 5 mL of reference buffer), a wash bottle, and a spare wash beaker.
  2. Connected the pH probe up to the control tower.
  3. Ran the pH calibration program. 
    1. Navigate to the web browser window from the previous step
    2. Select pH from the list of options in the centre of the screen
    3. Click on calibration
    4. Click measure and follow the instructions
      1. Washed the probe tip thoroughly with deionized water (MilliQ) and wiped with a lint-free wipe before placing it in the reference buffers.
      2. Followed the instructions in the calibration program
      3. Washed the probe tip thoroughly with deionized water and wiped with a lint-free wipe
  4. After calibration, seal the probe in an autoclave bad ready for sterilization. *Place the probe end such that it sits with that end facing the opening part of the autoclave bag

Ensured that the dissolved oxygen probe was working

  1. Washed the probe tip thoroughly with deionized water and wiped with a lint-free wipe
  2. Screwed the DO probe into one of the free ports using fingers (not tools).
  3. Connected the dissolved oxygen probe to the control tower
  4. Waited for a signal (the probe should initially begin at 0% and rise to between 7-15% once submerged in MilliQ) *These results may vary
  5. Once signal is confirmed, disconnect the dissolved oxygen probe and seal it in an autoclave bag ready for sterilization *Place the probe end such that it sits with that end facing the opening part of the autoclave bag

Autoclaved the equipment

  1. Transported the probes and bottles to the autoclave using a trolley.
  2. Placed the autoclave liquid temperature probe in a bottle containing 500 mL of room-temperature tap water, then placed the bottle and probe on the bottom level in the autoclave
  3. Placed the vessel and bottles into the autoclave chamber.
  4. Set the autoclave to the liquid sterilization cycle (to prevent rapid cooling that may cause lines to pop off).
  5. Set the autoclave to use the liquid temperature probe
  6. Ran the sterilization cycle.

Calibrated the peristaltic pumps

  1. Gathered 100 mL of water in a beaker, a 100 mL measuring cylinder and an arms-length piece of 6 mm (1/4 inch) silicone tubing
  2. Ran the calibration program:
    1. Followed the instructions in the calibration program
      1.  The arrows below each pump on the biostat A indicate the flow of liquid once the tubes are connected. 
      2.  First prime the line ensuring that the complete line is filled with liquid
      3.  Switch the pump (i.e., SUBS-A to automatic and pump out an arbitrary volume of water i.e., 30 mL, into the measuring cylinder)
      4.  The sartorius control tower will measure the time it takes for the liquid to be pumped and after calibration indicate the volume pumped, which will be used to determine the flow rate. 
    2. For pump SUBS-A and SUBS-B, set Mode: OFF in the first menu and Mode: Automatic in the second menu

Moved the sterile bioreactor vessel and bottles from the autoclave to near a
BSC (all connections are required to made in a BSC for sterility)

  1. Removed outer bag
  2. Sprayed down and put into a BSC
  3. Removed inner bag
  4. Connector lines:
    * Harvest line at the bottom (big line with a clamp)
    * Seed line - at the top, connected to thicker tube for the cells
    * Media line - hooked up to a large line with a clamp
    * Insert the probes (pH and dissolved oxygen probes) into the vessel. Remove the rubber plug on the top of the bioreactor to insert the probes.
  5. Waited for the autoclaving chamber to cool to 60-70'C
  6. Opened the chamber and checked connections to make sure that all vessels remained sealed. In the event that any tubing popped off, rinsed the connections with 70% ethanol and reconnected, and autoclave again; or, re-autoclaved the entire assembly.
  7. Placed the vessel and bottles on a trolley and moved the trolley next to a BSC.
