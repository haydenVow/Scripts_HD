Growth Media:

  * [X]  E8_10C (ACF medium) 
  * [X]  DMEM/F12 + 20% FBS + 1X P/S + P38i (10uM)




### Process:

1\. Took image of vessel with microscope on phase setting.

3\. Aliquotted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then
placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath for a minimum of 20 minutes
prior to use:

  1. TrypLE:   600  mL in   2 x 300 mL  pots  10:45 am   

  2.  dPBS (for washing and neutralising):   1200  mL in   4 x 250 mL   pots   10:45 am   

  3. 10C growth media for pellet resuspension:   30  mL in   1 x 50 mL  tube    12:20    

  4. 10C growth media (for seeding):   5  mL in   1 x 15 mL  tube  15:30  
  5. D/F+20%FBS+1xP/S+P38i (for seeding): 2 mL in 1 x 15 mL tubes 15:30   

Note: if aliquots were placed in water bath at different time, record the time
stamp for each individual solution.




4\. Removed vessel(s) from the incubator

5\. Washed the vessel(s) with 100 mL dPBS (warmed). Equalised, re-circulated
the dPBS, equalised again.

6\. Added   100  mL tryple to each 2CF. Equalised, re-circulated the Tryple,
equalised again, and incubated at 37˚C.

  1. Start/Finish for TrypLE was     11:52 - 12:06 am 

7\. Added   100 mL   dPBS/2CF. Equalised, re-circulated the dPBS, equalised
again. Poured into sterile 500 mL pot. Aliquotted cell suspension from pot
into centrifuge tubes. Again added  100 mL   dPBS/2CF. Equalised, re-
circulated the dPBS, equalised again. Poured into same 500 mL pot, then
aliquotted into centrifuge tubes.

8\. Centrifuged at 650 x g for 5 min.

  1. Start/Finish time for centrifugation was     12:17 - 12:22  
  2. Start/Finish time for centrifugation was     12:23 - 12:28  
  3. Start/Finish time for centrifugation was     12:29 - 12:34  




9\. Aspirated the supernatant(s).

10\. Resuspended pellet(s) in    32   mL   10C   media  

11\. Aliquoted   2 x 100 uL   of resuspended cells into a microcentrifuge tube
for cell count. Took 1 x 10 uL sample from each 100 uL sample for a total of 2
cell counts.

12\. Performed cell counts using the haemocytometer and recorded the cell
count data in the Google Doc spreadsheet called 'Cell Count Spreadsheet' (see
link below):

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1DPzKubYxfHmWogVPihC-
SSIBtIylyrBQE5kRX5Z8NtI/edit#gid=0

  1.  Total average cell number was:     2 cell counts added together/2 = 61,943,000  
  2.  Volume to re-suspend pellet in to achieve 0.8M cells in 50 uL to seed 76 wells (72 with excess):   3800 uL      




13\. Centrifuged cell suspension at 650 x g for 5 min.

  1. Start/Finish time for centrifugation was   13:34 

15\. Re-suspended pellet in  3800 uL  warmed 10C medium

16\. Received cell suspension of cells in serum-containing media from cell
expansion team (LAB BOOK LINK)

17\. Centrifuged cell suspension at 650 x g for 5 min

  * Start/Finish time for centrifugation was    14:07    

18\. Re-suspended pellet in  1000 uL warmed D/F+20%FBS+1xP/S+P38i

14\. Transferred cell suspensions to 2 x sterile reservoirs and, using a
multichannel pipette, added 50 uL of cell suspension to each zein scaffold

16\. Left at RT in the BSC for 30 min to allow cells to settle      14:25 -
15:00  

17\. Transferred vessel(s) to incubate at:

  * [X]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (avian cells)

Observations/Summary:

Zein scaffold coated with either EPL or Pectin were seeded with 0.8M cells per
scaffold in ACF (10C) or serum-containing (D/F+20%FBS+1xP/S+P38i) medium




### Results:

  * Results were;
    * [X]  As Usual (this is a repetitive task)
    * [ ]  Unexpected because...
    * [X]  Need to be further analysed
      * Will fix and DAPI stain tomorrow to determine whether cells adhered
    * [ ]  Other (.......)
