Breakdown of seeded wells:

Cell containing:

Anchor points and no insert samples will contain: 640ul collagen sol: 160ul
cell suspension (4:1) - final volume of 800 uL in each well

Conical insert samples will contain: 240ul collagen sol: 60ul cell suspension
(4:1) - final volume of 300 uL in each well

Cell free:

No cells anchor point  samples and no insert samples: 640 uL collagen sol :
160uL growth media - final volume of 800uL per well.

No cell conical insert samples will contain: 240ul collagen sol: 60ul growth
media  (4:1) - final volume of 300 uL in each well

  

  




Preparation Media :

Cell free:  
Collagen: ~3.680 mL  
Cold growth media (no cells): 0.920 mL

Cell containing:  
Collagen: 4.560 mL  
Cold growth media with cells : 1.140 mL (95M cells in 1140uL of cell
suspension media. Each sample has a seeding density of 16.67M cells per mL)

Feed media:  
Pre-warm growth media containing p38i for feed: 16 ml + 4mL for error = 20mL

  




Prepare plate:

  1. Add sterile inserts into a non-treated 24-well plate (see plate map below). Place lid ontop and parafilm. Place the plate with the tray and inserts into the fridge for a minimum of 30min before seeding, timestamp 11:05




Cell free seeding in gel

  1. Remove PureCol® EZ Gel solution from 4°C storage (fridge)
  2. Remove the 24 well plate from fridge and remove parafilm
  3. Add 920uL of cold growth media to 3.680 mL of PureCol® EZ Gel 
  4. Whilst suspension is still cold, transfer cell free mix into the wells: 
    1. No insert: 800 uL directly in the middle (n=3)
    2. pin insert: 800 uL to the pin insert, making sure the gel surrounds the pin (n=2)
    3. Conical insert: 300 uL onto the conical inserts (n=2)

Centrifuge 71.32 mL of cell suspension.

Re-suspend in 1.140 mL of GM.

  

Cells-laden seeding in gel

  1. Prepare cell suspension (95M cells in 1.140 ml in GM and place in fridge at 4'C for a minimum of 10 minutes (~1hr max). 
  2. Remove PureCol® EZ Gel solution from 4°C storage (fridge)
  3. Add 1.140ml of the cold cell suspension to 4.56 ml of cold PureCol® EZ Gel solution (ratio of 4:1 gel:cells, based on: https://advancedbiomatrix.com/purecol-ezgel.html) 
  4. Remove the 24 well plate from fridge and remove parafilm
  5. Whilst the cell-gel mix is still cold seed the inserts (IMPORTANT TO BE QUICK SO MIX STAYS COLD):
    1. anchor points: 800ul per well around and between the insert legs (n=3)
    2. conical inserts: 300ul per well around the perimeter trough of the insert (n=3)
    3. no inserts: 800ul to the center of the well (n=3 )  
  

  6. Move the plate containing the gels into the incubator (37°C, 5% CO2). Gelation will occur within 40 minutes, but allow approximately 60 to minutes for firm gel formation (should start almost immediately). Start 15:40
  7. After 60 minutes (or until gel is firm can take up to 90 min) add pre-warmed proliferation media to each well (DMEM/F12 + 20% FBS + 1x P/S + p38i, enough media to fully immerse samples ~1.5mls per well). 16:23  
  
Note - add media gently to the side of the well so as not to dislodge the gels
from the insert




Observations/Summary:

some bubbles in collagen gels.

Conical insert only had 230uL instead of 300uL of gel
