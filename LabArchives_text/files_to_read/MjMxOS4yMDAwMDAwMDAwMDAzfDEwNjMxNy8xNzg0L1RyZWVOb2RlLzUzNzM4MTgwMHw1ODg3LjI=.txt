Took samples

  1. Unscrewed the "BENCHMARK" sample tube cover.
  2. Sprayed down the tube end with 70% ethanol.
  3. Connected a 5 mL sterile syringe.
  4. Withdrew slightly more than 3 mL (to purge the line).
  5. Discarded the 5 mL syringe.
  6. Connected a fresh sterile syringe and withdrew sample 4 mL.
  7. Disconnected sample syringe and transferred sample to vessel(s) for subsequent analysis.
    1. 3 x 1 mL aliquots in 3x 1.5 mL Eppendorf tubes
  8. Sprayed sample tube end and cap with 70% ethanol, re-attached cap.

there was some backflow into sample line - look out for contamination  
  
  
  
  




Stained and imaged cells adhered to microcarriers

  1. Added 1 drop of Hoechst 33342 readyprobes reagent to each tube
  2. Vortexed at minimum power for 30 seconds
  3. Left the tubes to incubate at room temperature, in the dark (away from light), for ~15 minutes.  `| 10:10 - 10:25   |`
  4. `Added 3 x 50 uL of dPBS to 3` x wells of a 96 well plate
  5. `After incubation, transferred 50 uL from each tube to a well containing 50 uL of dPBS `
  6. The wells were inspected under the Axio microscope, 5x objective.
  7. Using https://mia-capture.vow.tools/#/, 1 set of same frame images using the DAPI and PHASE channels were captured for each well `|   |`
    1. Fluorescence intensity of the UV lamp was adjusted until the centre of each microcarrier was barely visible compared to the space between microcarriers.
  8. Once images were captured, Image pairs were assigned a 'location ID' in MIA capture. 
  9. Images captured were then selected for analysis using the 'uCarrier cell count plastic' tool from MIA capture. 
  10. Estimated cell count was 67 million cells, based on an initial microcarrier count of 10.75 million microcarriers (2.5 g of microcarriers at 4.3 million microcarriers/g dry mass)

  

  






Analysis using nuclei ejection.

### Process:

Nuclei Ejection:

  1. Removed 0.9 mL of the supernatant from the 1.5mL tubes carefully without aspirating the microcarriers.

  2. Washed microcarriers using 0.9 mL of room temperature Dulbecco's phosphate buffered saline without Ca2+ and Mg2+ (DPBS-/-).
  3. Aspirated and discarded the dPBS wash.
  4. Added 0.9 mL of cell lysis solution to the microcarriers
  5. Vortexed the 1.5 mL tube for 1 min at maximum speed to release nuclei.
  6. Loaded 10uL of each Hoechst stained sample onto a countess slide and took three images of separate locations under the DAPI imaging channel on the Zaber under the 10x objective.
  7. Took three images of separate locations under the DAPI imaging channel on the Axio under the 5x objective.

Set feed schedule

  1. Set automatic feeding
    1. Open LEVEL menu
    2. Set Harvest/Feed to FEED
    3. Set MODE to AUTOMATIC
    4. Close menu
    5. Open LEVELT pump menu
    6. Set MODE to AUTOMATIC
  2. Set medium drain schedule
    1. Open the SUBS-A menu
    2. Open the PROFILE submenu
    3. Create a profile that pumps 500 mL after 48 hours (at ~100 mL/min for SUBS-A pump, the profile should be at 100% pumping rate from roughly 48:00:00 to 48:05:00)
    4. Close PROFILE submenu
    5. Set MODE to PROFILE
    6. Close menu
