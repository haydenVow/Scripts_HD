Aim


To further explore potential biomaterial candidates and determine the effect
of the addition of gluten


Hypothesis


Due to the different properties required in the final scaffold, more than one
biomaterial will be needed to create the final bioink.


Method


1\. Hydrate various biomaterials.

1A. Add methylcellulose to chilled water and dissolve.

1B. Heat 60C and add in alginate, gluten (if added), xanthan, and then
glucomannan.

2.Cast in moulds/extrude and set.

2A. Determine resolution of print, idea of viscosity, shear thinning

2B. Determine solubility in water.

3\. Autoclave.

Observations

Hydrating materials - Using a magnetic stir bar or cold water did not assist
in dissolving methyl cellulose. Manual stirring with a spatula was required to
break apart large lumps, however lumps of methyl cellulose still were present.
The addition of the rest of the components aided in mixing of the components,
which suggests we could possibly mix the powders first and then add them to
the water. Gluten containing samples were autoclaved straight away, while the
other samples were refrigerated overnight. After 2 hrs in the fridge the
undissolved components had become hydrated and will be stirred through the
next day.
