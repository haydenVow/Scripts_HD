## Performed by: Michael, Bec, Marie, Avani, Jared  




Process:

  1. Prepare 33mL of MDB by dissolving  150`.00` mg of collagenase II  powder in  66 mL of wash media. MDB Collagenase II calculations (750U/mL in 33mL WM)

LotConc (U/mg)Collagenase (mg)WM(mL)  
  
33015066  
  
11mL is needed for each biopsy. Prepare fresh before tissue digestion.
Sterilize with 0.22 μm filter.

  2. Prepare in hood: Scalpels, blotting paper, dissection scissors, 2mL aliquot of MDB, 100mm plates, 50mL tubes ready and labelled with cell type and Col II Lot #, Parafilm.

  3. Details of animal biopsy harvest & transportation

  4. Biopsies collected at    `approx ~15:30-16:00 `

    1. `Iodine solution was poured over the alpaca leg and left there for ~2 mins?`

    2. Gently dabbed away excess with sterile gauze

    3. Sprayed the surface of the leg with 70% ethanol. Waited for 2 mins
    4. `To take muscle biopsies, first cut a square (not too deep) to remove the skin`

      1.   

    5. Change scalpels and tweezers (as the outer layer may be contaminated). Cut another square into the tissue (not too deep). Remove this - It will not be used as it may be contaminated.

      1.     6. Change scalpels and tweezers and take biopsies (approx 3x2x2cm)

    5. Biopsy #5:
      1. location: 
      2. number of pieces: 3
        1. 5.1 and 5.2 were taken from near the knee (large circle)
        2. 5.3 was taken from the area indicated by smaller circle
      3. Note: these 3 biopsies were not muscle biopsies. They were taken from the surface. This involved using scalpels and tweezers to pull and cut away the thin outer white layer.



  1. Collect muscle biopsy, transfer to BSC.  `16:32   
`

  2. Transfer the biopsy to 1 x 10cm plate containing 2mL WM in the Biosafety cabinets to perform the following steps:
  3. Cut each biopsy into 4-5 pieces using dissection scissors.
  4. Transfer pieces from each biopsy to a fresh 100mm plate (or use the lids of the initial dishes).

Note* Perform all following steps for each biopsy provided.

Blot the biopsy to remove any blood, and then quickly cut off any adherent
fat/connective tissue (don't spend ages doing this, just anything large
clearly hanging off). Get the biopsy into a dish sooner rather later to
prevent it from drying out.

If the muscle is well digested, triturate through a 10mL serological pipette.

If there are still muscle chunks, `using a 10 mL syringe and 20-gauge needle,
aspirate and eject the muscle suspension in and out of the syringe 10 times.`

CRITICAL STEP: The needle may be clogged by small pieces of tendon or
undigested muscle during the first few attempts. If clogging occurs during
trituration, remove the clog from the tip of the needle. If clogging occurs
during ejection, pull the plunger up and down to move the clog out of
position. Eject towards the wall of the tube (as opposed to the bottom) to
avoid foaming.

Observations/Summary:

In summary of the days events, for clarification, the tissue samples processed
by each operator (Marie/Jared, Avani/Bec and Michael) were re-annotated with
new unique identifying biopsy codes in SV1 (airtable) and will henceforth be
referred to as the following KUZCO cell lines:  
  
Marie/Jared biopsy original number = 1.3, KUZCO cell line number = KUZCO8

Avani/Bec biopsy original number = 2.5,  KUZCO cell line number = KUZCO7

Michael biopsy original number = 4.3, KUZCO cell line number = KUZCO9

  

All cell cultures derived from these raw isolates (if any) will belong to the
KUZCO7,
