## Procedure

  1. Aliquoted 195 mL of HyCell CHO base medium 
  2. Added KSR and growth factors to 378 mL aliquot as described in table below (this will result in 1 x 245 mL aliquot) 
  3. Aliquoted 211 mL of CD CHO base medium 
  4. Added KSR and growth factors to 378 mL aliquot as described in table below (this will result in 1 x 265 mL aliquot) 
  5. Split HyCell CHO aliquot into 4 x 60 mL aliquots and CD CHO aliquot into 3 x 60 and 1 x 80 mL aliquots 
  6. Add HDAC1, HDAC2 and P53i to 6 x 60 mL aliquots (3 of each basal medium) as described in table below. Leave 1 x 60 mL & 1 x 80 mL aliquot as is (control media).
