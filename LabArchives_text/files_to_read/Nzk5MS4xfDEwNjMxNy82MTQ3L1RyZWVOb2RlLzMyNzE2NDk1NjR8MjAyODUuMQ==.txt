Process:

1\. Open spreadsheet link below for heat-up for each 384 well plate

2\. Remove the first plate from the incubator and transfer in the BSC and
remove the lid facing upwards to allow the condensation the evaporate (Should
take <5 mins). Can also spray in a lint wipe with ethanol and wipe the lid of
the plate to remove the condensation faster.  

3\. Check each well that is highlighted as green in each of the plate map to
confirm the presence of cells (Ignore the corner wells i.e. A1/A24/P1/P24)

4\. If cells are present indicate in the table below the well ID and how many
cells are present and capture images using the Primovert in the library lab
under the respective plate ID

5\. If no cells can be detected do not include these wells in the table below

6\. Repeat process for the remaining plate

*Insert row below for each well that has cells
