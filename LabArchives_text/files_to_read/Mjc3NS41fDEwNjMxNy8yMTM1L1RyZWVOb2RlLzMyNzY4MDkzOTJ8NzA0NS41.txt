Process:

2 x 1 ml media aliquots in 15 ml falcon tubes should be stored in library lab
(bottom fridge, 105?). Labelled 'E6' and 'HS' on the lids, with 'M5531' and
'M4947' respectively on the side. The plate is stored on the top shelf of
incubator 77 in library lab.

1\. Aliquotted   0.5 mL  mL of E6 media into   1 x 15mL   tube and aliquotted
0.5 mL  mL of  HS media into   1 x 15mL tube. Stored in the fridge 105.

2\. Placed both tubes in water bath. 15:48

3\. Removed  100  % of Growth Media from vessel. 15:56

4\. Replaced with  150 uL (per well/per vessel) of  Diff   media.

5\. Returned vessel to incubate at  16:03

  * [X]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (aviary cells)

  

  * Incubator (#77 ), Lab [Library]




### Observations/Summary:

 100 % media changed on vessel(s)

  1. 7148-DOLLY12-15D11-Sheep P11-3of3

\- Cells in E6 medium starting to peel away from edges of well (commonly seen
later on in diff assays, particularly in E6 medium) (see images at bottom of
lab book)
