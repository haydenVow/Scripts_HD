Growth Media:

  * [ ]  DMEM + 10% FBS + 1X P/S

  

Prepare materials for thaw and seed:

1\. Aliquotted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then
placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath for a minimum of 20 minutes
prior to use:

  *  Growth media (for seeding):   1 x 5 mL + 2 x 30mL in  3  tubes 
  * Time that aliquot was placed in the water bath to warm before use:   11:06  am 

  




## Thaw and seed vial:

3\. Collected the cryovial from Liquid Nitrogen storage & place in foam
floater in water bath for 3 min  11:29 - 11:32 am

Location where cryovial was collected from:

Vial details:  1   x  mouse fibroblast  cryovials at  ?   cells

Brew

Tower/Bucket 4  

Box/Cane 3  

Vial location: E9  

Vial ID(s):  

`4. Ethanol sprayed & transferred the vial to the BSC.```  

`5.  Collected 1 x 10uL aliquot for cell count. (this is a backup in case the
next count is too dilute) - WAS NOT NEEDED  
`

`6. Measured the total volume of cell suspension in the cryovial for total
volume (  1000  µL) `

`7. Transferred the contents into the tube containing 5mL of Growth Media```  

`8. Collect 1 x 10uL aliquot for cell count. - USED FOR COUNT  
`

`9. Perform a cell count from the 2nd sample taken (from the 5mL growth media
+ cell suspension = 6mL total) by diluting the sample 1:1 in trypan blue and
counting on a hemocytometer.`

`10. Determine total cell numbers`

Count

11\. Additional 90mL of Growth Media was placed in the water bath for 15 min
until warm. Existing 60mL + new 90mL added together in a sterile 250mL pot,
cells added and dispersed evenly.

`11. Seeded into 5 x T175 flasks at ~7,000 cells / cm2. (30mL each)  
`

`12. Transfered flask/plate(s) to incubate at: 11:54 am  
`

  * [ X]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (aviary cells)

  

Making labels

Note - Unclear what passage number the cells are at so they were labelled as
Passage 1 until further information is received
