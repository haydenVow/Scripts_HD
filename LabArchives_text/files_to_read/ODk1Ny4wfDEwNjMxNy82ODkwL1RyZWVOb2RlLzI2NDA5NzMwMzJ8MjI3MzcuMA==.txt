Aim/Purpose


Pilot run of Nuvonis culture in 3L Mobius stir-tank bioreactor (to establish
how culture behaves in our hands following tech transfer)


Hypothesis


As above


Technical Gap


Vow do not routinely culture cells using a bioreactor - this is a pilot run to
establish conditions and workflow in-house, and to confirm cells retain
viability in stir-tank bioreactor as described by supplier


Method/Procedure


As per LabArchives Mobius template. Briefly,

  1. Culture cells in shake-flask to required density (100 000 000 cells total)
  2. Prepare Mobius bioreactor as per template, prepare 2L media
  3. Seed cells into bioreactor
  4. Monitor cell count and morphology over 5 days
  5. Harvest on day 5
