### Process:

Intermittent agitation to facilitate adhesion

  1. 13 396 600 cells in 4.8 mL of E89C were harvested. 
    1. See lab book entry: https://au-mynotebook.labarchives.com/share/Vow%2520-%2520Team%2520Science/MTA0My45fDEwNjMxNy84MDMvVHJlZU5vZGUvMzM0NDU5Mjc3OXwyNjQ5Ljg5OTk5OTk5OTk5OTY=
    2. Transferred  896 uL  of of this cell suspension containing `2.5 million cells` into  30 mL of equilibrated microcarrier suspension in the culture vessels containing E89C, E810C, and E811B media.
  2. 2.5 M cells in 1.092mLof serum containing media were received from cell expansion
    1. See lab book entry: https://au-mynotebook.labarchives.com/share/Vow%2520-%2520Team%2520Science/Mzk1LjJ8MTA2MzE3LzMwNC9UcmVlTm9kZS8xODI0OTkyMDg1fDEwMDMuMTk5OTk5OTk5OTk5OQ==
    2. Transferred these cells into the E125 flask containing equiilibrated microcarrier suspension in serum containing media.

  1. Transferred vessel to incubate at:

  * [X]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (aviary cells)
  * [X] bottom sanyo incubator




  

  1. Began the seeding schedule for 6 hours (below) using the KASA app.
    1. The minimum required agitation speed for shaken cultures to maintain the microcarriers in suspension can be estimated using this calculator: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/18NrC_xaJ2I87B4x3vTE46Z-ZUS3EV0Gw-CnM0DcukL4/edit?usp=sharing
      * Shake speed used = 120 rpm  

      * shaking started at 1:08 pm. Shaking cycle included 2 minutes of shaking followed by 28 minutes of static for 6 hours. Continuous shaking began at 7:08 pm.
    2. The seeding schedule may be reduced or extended by removing or adding 30 minute cycles as required. Generally, at least 3 but up to 12 hours are required to allow the maximum number of the inoculated cells to adhere.
