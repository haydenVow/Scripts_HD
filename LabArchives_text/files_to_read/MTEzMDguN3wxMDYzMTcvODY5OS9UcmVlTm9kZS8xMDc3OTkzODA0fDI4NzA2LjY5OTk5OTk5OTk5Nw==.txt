Process
  
  
*Note: Flasks have been labelled with numbers 1-36, where #1 refers to flask ID 12686 and #36 refers to flask ID 12721, in order to make the labelling of ViCell and 15mL tubes quicker.  
  
         Outside the BSC

  1. Took 3 x 2mL aliquot of RPMI + Nuvonis and deposited in 1 x 15mL tube each, having a total of 3 x 15mL tubes.  
  

  2. Placed 3 x 15mL tube in incubator before starting to sample flasks to allow enough time for temperature equilibration.  
  
 In the BSC  
  

  3. Took 1 x 2.5mL aliquot from each 36 x E125 using a 5mL stripette and deposited in 1 x 15mL tube. [First part including counting and pH reading: 9:30 am-12:30pm]   
  
Outside the BSC  
  

  4. Took 1 x 500uL aliquot from each 15mL tube and deposited in 1 x ViCell tube. Once taken the aliquot, placed 15mL tubes in incubator until ready to perform pH readings.  
  

  5. Performed counts on ViCell and recorded counts in media results G-sheet.  
  

  6. While counts are being performed, performed pH reading on the remaining 2mL per 15mL tube, and recorded measurements in the media results G-sheet. *Note: In order to obtain an accurate pH reading, removed 12 x 15mL tubes set at the same starting pH, placed thermometer into one of the 1 x 15mL tube containing RPMI + Nuvonis previously equilibrated and pH probe into 15mL tube containing sample.  
  

  7. Once finished measuring pH, took a 250uL aliquot from each 2mL sample contained in a 15mL tube and deposited into 1 x 1.5mL tube, having a total of 36 x 1.5mL tubes.  
  

  8. Diluted 1:2 with an equal volume of MiliQ water (250uL).   
  

  9. Quick-spun for 1 minute, using the bento lab or microcentrifuge.  
  

  10. Aspirated supernatant and deposited in new tube, having a total of 36 x 1.5mL tubes. Discarded pellet.  
  

  11. Placed in the -20'C freezer in Main Lab (#184) in a plastic box labelled "Biochem analyses for BIF'.  
  

  12. Enter the details of your samples in this G-sheet. Please try to ensure the order of the samples in the box match the order in the spreadsheet.
