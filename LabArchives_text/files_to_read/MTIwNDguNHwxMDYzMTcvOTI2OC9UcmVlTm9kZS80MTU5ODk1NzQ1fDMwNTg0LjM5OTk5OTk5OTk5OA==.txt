Plate map/Diagram


Clear visual demonstrating which vessels/wells require feeds with what media
and volumes of media.




Process:

  1. Aliquotted  1200  mL of  growth media listed in table 1-2 
  2. Placed in water bath for 10-20 minutes minimum
  3. Removed 100 % of supernatant from vessel
  4. Replaced with  see table 2mL (per well/per vessel) of  growth media listed in table 1-2  
  5. Returned vessel to incubate
