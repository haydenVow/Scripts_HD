### Process:

1\. Took image of vessel with microscope on phase setting.

2\. Gelatin coated     6 wells in 2x96 well plates    with sterile filtered
0.1% gelatin solution and then incubated all coated flasks at 37˚C.

2.5. Removed 4 gelatin coated T175s from the fridge containing 0.1% sterile
filtered gelatin solution, incuated the flasks at 37 degrees C.

  1. Time when all vessels(s) placed into the incubator       9:54   a/pm 
  2. Coated 6 more T175 flasks with gelatin and placed them in the incubator at [13:38]   

  3. Coated 1 more 96 well plate (6 wells) with gelatin and placed in the incubator at [13:38] 

NOTE: PREPARE AND SEED DIFF ASSAY ACCORDING TO EXPERIMENT TEMPLATE:

3\. Aliquotted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then
placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath for a minimum of 20 minutes
prior to use:

  1. TrypLE:     40    mL in     1x50mL     tubes
  2.  dPBS (for washing and neutralising):     40    mL in    1x50mL    tubes
  3. Growth media (for pellet resuspension):     2    mL in     1x15mL    tubes
  4. Growth media (for seeding diff assay):     2.7    mL in     1x15mL    tubes
  5. Growth media (for seeding planar culture):    300    mL in     1x500mL    container.   

  6. Growth media (for seeding suspension culture: See next lab book entry in EPIC.   

Time that all aliquots were placed in the water bath the warm before use
14:28   a/pm

Note: if aliquots were placed in water bath at different time, record the time
stamp for each individual solution.




4\. Removed vessel(s) from the incubator     15:28   a/pm

5\. Washed the vessel(s) with dPBS (warmed).

6\. Added     10    mL tryple to each vessel/well and incubated at 37˚C.

  1. Start/Finish for TrypLE was     15:36-15:47   a/pm 

7\. Neutralised with    10mL      dPBS and combined cell suspension into a
2x50mL     tube.

8\. Centrifuged at 650 x g for 5 min.

  1. Start/Finish time for centrifugation was     16:10   a/pm 




9\. Aspirated the supernatant(s).

10\. Resuspended pellet(s) in     1    mL     growth     media     16:28
a/pm

11\. Aliquoted      10uL    of resuspended cells into a microcentrifuge tube
for cell count.

12\. Performed a cell count using the haemocytometer and recorded the cell
count data in the Google Doc spreadsheet called 'Cell Count Spreadsheet' (see
link below):

SSIBtIylyrBQE5kRX5Z8NtI/edit#gid=0&range=1015:1015

  1.  Total cell number was:      1,592,000       




Transferred 0.243mL of cell suspension containing 192857 cells to the pre-
warmed      2.7     mL Growth media:      16:38    a/pm

2\. Transferred 140uL of cell suspension into each of the 6 gelatin coated
wells across all 3 pre-gelatin coated      96 well      plates after removing
excess gelatin. (B2-4, C2-4).

3\. Transferred vessel(s) to incubate at: 16:49

  * [x]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (avian cells)

Planar culture cell requirements (1/4 of harvested cells):

Cells remaining: 1592000-192857 = 1399143

1399143 / 4 = 349785.75.  

1\. Transferred      440     µl of cell suspension containing 349785.75 cells
to pre-warmed aliquot of     60mL     mL Growth media:      16:59    a/pm  

2\. Left at RT in the BSC for 30 min to allow cells to settle      16:59  \-
17:30 a/pm  

3\. Transferred vessel(s) to incubate at:

  * [x]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells), incubator #67. 
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (avian cells)

Suspension culture cell requirements (3/4 of harvested cells):

Cells remaining: 1049357.

### Observation

Noticed some abnormal cell morphology on these cells prior to passage.
Proceeded with passaging but consulted Katie about the issue.

  




### Results:

  * Results were;
    * [ ]  As Usual (this is a repetitive task)
    * [x]  Unexpected because...
    * Cell morphology appeared unusual. cells appeared splattered when examined down the primovert on  4x and 20x objective.
    * Cell numbers from the passage were also lower than expected, Compared to DOLLY12_11E7 which produced around 6-8 million at this time point after thaw from MCB.
    * [ ]  Need to be further analysed
    * [ ]  Other (.......)
