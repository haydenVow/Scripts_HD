### Process:

1\. Took image of vessel with microscope on phase setting.

3\. Aliquotted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then
placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath for a minimum of 20 minutes
prior to use:

  1. TrypLE:     5    mL in    1     tubes
  2.  dPBS (for neutralising):     5    mL
  3.  dPBS (for washing):     5    mL
  4. Growth media (for pellet resuspension):      2   mL
  5. Growth media (for seeding):     30    mL 

Time that all aliquots were placed in the water bath the warm before use
15:31 pm

Note: if aliquots were placed in water bath at different time, record the time
stamp for each individual solution.




4\. Removed vessel(s) from the incubator     15:40 pm

5\. Washed the vessel(s) with dPBS (warmed).

6\. Added     5    mL tryple to each vessel/well and incubated at 37˚C.

  1. Start/Finish for TrypLE was     15:43 pm 

7\. Neutralised with    5mL    dPBS and combined cell suspension into a   1  x
15mL  tube.

8\. Centrifuged at 650 x g for 5 min.

  1. Start/Finish time for centrifugation was   15:59 - 16:04 pm 




9\. Aspirated the supernatant(s).

10\. Resuspended pellet(s) in     1    mL     Growth     media     16:07  pm

11\. Aliquoted      10uL    of resuspended cells into a microcentrifuge tube
for cell count.

12\. Performed a cell count using the haemocytometer and recorded the cell
count data in the Google Doc spreadsheet: Cell Count Spreadsheet or cell count
widget below

  1. Total cell number was:      460,000       

  2. Volume of cell suspension required for subculture was:       ALL      

  3. Cell density per vessel:    2600/cm2      




13\. Transferred      all     µl of cell suspension to the pre-warmed
30   mL Growth media:      16:18 pm

14\. Transferred cell suspension into the    T175       vessel.

16\. Transferred vessel(s) to incubate at:  16:22 pm  

  * [ ]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (avian cells)

Observations/Summary:

F_KUZCO18 cells expanded and seeded at a lower density as required (2600 cells
/ cm2)
