## Harvest:

D0 Harvest and encapsulate cells :  

##

Harvest yield:  21.6 M cells

harvest volume:   13.5 mL




## Encapsulation of cells in 250 uM RGD starting conc.

  1. centrifuge ~ 21 M cells and resuspend in growth media to a total max volume of XXX mL       11:45

  2. Prepare cell suspensions in alginate at 1% and 2% final Alginate density:
    1. 1/2 of volume = 4% (or 2% Alginate prediluted with media) = 300 uL (for 1% 150 Alg + 150 Media)
    2. 1/3 of volume = cell suspension (or cell free substitute), 20M cells/mL or higher (200 uL)
    3. 1/6 of volume = RGD peptide (mix in last and immediately form meatballs), dilute 100x from stock RGD (100 uL of of a predilution as follows: 150 uL RGD into 850 uL media)
  3.  Prepare cell free alginate gel only and dispense first:   12:00    

    1. using a P200 for each condition, produce gel droplets at the pipette tip and drop into a Calcium bath (1.5mL in 24wp well) from a close distance (to avoid deformation and maintain spherical shape). 5 "meatballs" per well only to allow for sufficient media to feed the encapsulated cells
  4. Gelation will occur within 2 minutes, but allow approximately 5 minutes for firm gel formation.
  5. Transfer all inserts to a new plate preloaded with 1.5 mL media (wash 1) for 2 min
  6. Transfer all inserts to a new plate preloaded with 1.5mL media (wash 2) for 2 min
  7. Transfer all inserts to a new plate preloaded with 1.5 mL media
  8. Put plate in incubator 12:20 pm
    1. PLATE ID: 9486  

    2. PLATE LOCATION: Contherm

Observations:

Gel spheres merged in the buckets, 5 drops were added to each well but only in
some wells individual spheres was achieved
