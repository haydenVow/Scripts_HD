months

  1. Added 20 uL of Hoechst stain directly to cells
  2.  Added 80 uL of dead stain solution (dPBS+Nucgreen) to cells
  3. Incubated for 30 minutes in the dark at room temperature  

  * 14:13-14:43

  1. Made 4x, 8x and 16x dilutions of the sample in dPBS 
  2. Centrifuged plates at 300 RCF for 1 minute  
    1. 14:44  

  3. Prepared plate map:
