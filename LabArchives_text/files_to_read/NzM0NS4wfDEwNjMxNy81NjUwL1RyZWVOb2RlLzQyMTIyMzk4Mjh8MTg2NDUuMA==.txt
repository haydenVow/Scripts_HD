RELATED TO OKR:  

Develop a QMS-compliant serum-free media that supports 20+ doublings of our
chosen species in suspension, at a doubling rate <48hrs

AIM/PURPOSE:

Adapt cells to suspension in CD-CHO media supplemented with plant-derived
hydrolysates.

HYPOTHESIS:

Incorporation of plant-derived hydrolysates in addition to CD-CHO basal media
will enable DOLLY_12 fibroblasts to adapt to suspension culture conditions.
