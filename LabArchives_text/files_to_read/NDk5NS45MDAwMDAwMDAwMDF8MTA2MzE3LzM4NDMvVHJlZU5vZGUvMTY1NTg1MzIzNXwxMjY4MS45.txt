Process:

  * 96 deep-well plate
  * 15 mL falcon tube
  * 135 mL E6

1\. Using the tables below, first create 1 in 10 dilutions of the concentrated
stocks highlighted in red. To reduce buffer concentration in the final
mixture, these can be done in E6 media.

2\. Add the designated volume of concentrated stock to stock E6, making up to
2 mL of each stock in all wells for Row A and E (excluding Columns 11 and 12).

Note: The following compounds were culled in light of inconsistent seeding of
columns 11 and 12 (now used for controls).

  * Dodecanoic acid
  * Glyoxylic acid 
  * Thioridazine
  * Glucosamine

Hence, columns 1- 10 will be used for the remaining 20 factors in the same
fashion/dilutions as the original plan - and columns 11 and 12 will feature 3
replicates of each of the 5 controls in a snake pattern.

4\. Using a multichannel pipette (6 tips at a time), transfer 300 uL from the
1X row into the row below. Repeat this process twice more until you have 4
rows of every condition from 1X to 0.008X.3. In the remaining wells, add 1.2
mL E6 media.

Making the control media

There will be five control medias; 1) E6 control, 2) E6 + EtOH, 3) E6 + DMSO,
4) E6 + HCl 5) 2% HS  

In a snake pattern, each of those control were made up in order in columns 11
and 12
