2\. Aliquotted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then
placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath for a minimum of 20 minutes
prior to use:

  * Growth media (for seeding):   3mL 
  * Growth media (for washing):  5mL
  * Time that aliquot was placed in the water bath to warm before use:   14:25   

  




## Thaw and seed vial:

  1. Collected the cryovial from Liquid Nitrogen storage & place in foam floater in water bath for 3 min  14:45   
Location where cryovial was collected from: 3291-Culture-7379-Vial-1of4
Quarantine Dewar, Tower 3 (was acctually in tower 2).

  2. `Ethanol sprayed & transferred the vial(s) to the BSC.```
  3. `Added  500µL of Growth Media (to generate a total volume of 1mL in the cryovial) to the cryovial, resuspended the cell suspension gently to reduce osmotic shock. `
  4. ```Collected the entire 1mL of cell suspension & transfer into the pre-warmed tube of Growth Media (for washing)`
  5. `Centrifuged for 5min at 650g.  
`

  6. `Removed supernatant and re-suspended cell pellet in 3mL fresh, pre-warmed growth media  
`

  7. Transferred cell suspension to 1x well of a 6-well plate
  8. `Transferred plate to incubate at: 15:00`

  * 30ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
