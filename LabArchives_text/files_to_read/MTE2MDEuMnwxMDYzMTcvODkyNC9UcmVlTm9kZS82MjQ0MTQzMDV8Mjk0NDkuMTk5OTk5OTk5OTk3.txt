Perform passage using below volumes:




## Performed by: Bonnie and Anushka




Note

Nathan made the excellent suggestion that a slow transition to Nuvonis
suspension media while still in planar culture prior to suspension adaptation,
may reduce stress during the adaption process. The base of this media is the
Freestyle 293 however which is not recommended for adherent culture. To assess
if weening onto the Nuvonis suspension media is feasible in planar culture, 4
x T75 flasks were seeded with 500,000 cells/flask in OptiPRO +4mmM Glutamax.
Tomorrow the will be given a media change with either OptiPRO + 4mM Glutamax +
25%, 50% or 100% Nuvonis Complete Suspension media.

Cell count had decreased since last passage. We believe this is likely due to
incomplete tryplisation of cells which we were unable to observe under the
microscope due to the height of the 10CF. For the remaining of this
experiment, 10CFs will not be used for this reason.

Harvest Process:

Aliquoted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then
placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath > 30 minutes prior to use

  1. TrypLE:    500  mL 
  2. dPBS (for washing & neutralising)   500 mL
  3. Growth media (for pellet resuspension and seeding):    used PBS (100mL)  
  4. Washed the flask(s) with dPBS.
  5. Added   500mL  tryple to each vessel/well and incubated at 37ËšC for   15min  
  6. Neutralised with    500mL dPBS (warmed) and combined cell suspension into a   225mL   tubes.
  7. Centrifuged at 650 x g for 5 min.
  8. Aspirated+ discarded supernatant
  9. Resuspended pellet(s) in     40  mL PBS.  
Performed a cell count using the hemocytometer and recorded the cell count
data in widget or the Google Doc spreadsheet called 'Cell Count Spreadsheet'
(see link below):

  10. Total cell number was: 17,120,000

  11. Cells were then seeded into either planar or suspension culture or Banked (see next steps

  12. 2M cells were taken from the cell suspension and placed in a 50mL falcon tube then centrifuged at 650g for 5min

  13. In the meantime, remaining cell suspension was transferred to 600mL OptiPRO + 4mM Glutamax, then seeded into a 4CF , and placed in incubator 77, library lab at 37C and 5% CO2.

  14. Supernatant removed from 50mL tube after centrifugation, and cells re suspended in 48mL  OptiPRO + 4mM Glutamax. 12mL of the cell suspension then seeded into each of 4x T75s, placed in incubator 77, library lab at 37C and 5% CO2.
