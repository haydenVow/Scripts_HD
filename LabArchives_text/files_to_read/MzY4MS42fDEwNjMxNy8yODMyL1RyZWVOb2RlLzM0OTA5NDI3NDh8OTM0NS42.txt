### Process:

1\. Took image of vessel with microscope on phase setting.

2\. Gelatin coated     2     x    4CF      vessel + 1 x 2CF  with sterile
filtered 0.1% gelatin solution and then incubated all coated flasks at 37˚C.
(note - it is likely we will not seed all these flask)

  1. Time when all vessels(s) placed into the incubator       9:55   

3\. Aliquotted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then
placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath for a minimum of 20 minutes
prior to use:

  1. TrypLE:    100     mL in     1x120 mL    tube
  2.  dPBS (At 37 degrees for washing):      100   mL in   1x120 mL     tube
  3.  dPBS (at RT neutralising):     100    mL in   1x120mL     tubes
  4. Growth media (for pellet resuspension):    6    mL in   1x15mL  tube
  5. Growth media (for seeding):     1500    mL in     2    tubes

Time that all aliquots were placed in the water bath the warm before use
10:05  

Note: if aliquots were placed in water bath at different time, record the time
stamp for each individual solution.




4\. Removed vessel(s) from the incubator     10:45  

5\. Washed the vessel(s) with dPBS (warmed).

6\. Added     10    mL tryple to each vessel/well and incubated at 37˚C.

  1. Start/Finish for TrypLE was    11:03 - 11:13 (5 flasks - A), 11:08 - 11:18 (5 flasks - B)  

7\. Neutralised with     10     dPBS and combined cell suspension into a
1x250 mL falcon  tube.

8\. Centrifuged at 650 x g for 5 min.

  1. Start/Finish time for centrifugation was    11:39 - 11:44  




9\. Aspirated the supernatant(s).

10\. Resuspended pellet(s) in     10    mL    growth      media     11:55  

11\. Aliquoted     20uL     of resuspended cells into a microcentrifuge tube
for cell count.

12\. Performed a cell count using the haemocytometer and recorded counts in
"Seed Calculator" widget (see below):




Seeding for separate experiment

Shaleen - ELISA

Link to lab book:

Cell requirement: 1.5M

  

  

Tim - DSD

Link to lab book:

Cell requirement: ~0.8M

  




12\. Calculate the required cell suspension. (4CF - 4M cells    |   2CF - 2M
cells)  \- NOTE: we need at least 7.5M in order to reach the target by
Thursday next week.

13\. Transferred    2x 3500      µl of cell suspension to the pre-warmed    2x
600      mL Growth media:      12:50  

14\. Transferred cell suspension into the      13:00       pre-gelatin coated
2x4CF       vessel.

15\. Left at RT in the BSC for 30 min to allow cells to settle      13:10  \-
13:50  

16\. Transferred vessel(s) to incubate at: 13:55

  * [x]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells) thermo incubator
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (avian cells)
