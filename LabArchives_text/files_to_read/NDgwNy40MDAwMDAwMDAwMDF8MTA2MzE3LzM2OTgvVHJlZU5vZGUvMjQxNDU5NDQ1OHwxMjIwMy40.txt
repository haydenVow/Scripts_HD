### Process:

1\. Took image of vessel with microscope on phase setting.

2\. Gelatin coated   14 x T175  with sterile filtered 0.1% gelatin solution
and then incubated all coated flasks at 37˚C.

  1. Time when all vessels(s) placed into the incubator       12:39 pm 

3\. Aliquotted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then
placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath for a minimum of 20 minutes
prior to use:

  1. TrypLE:    40     mL in 
  2.  dPBS (At 37 degrees for washing):     40   mL 
  3.  dPBS (at RT neutralising):    40     mL 
  4. Growth media (for seeding):     210mL of Vit C and 210mL of GM + 27mL for seeding 2 x 96wp      

  5. Growth media (for pellet resus):     2    mL of each media type  

Time that all aliquots were placed in the water bath the warm before use
11:10 am

Note: if aliquots were placed in water bath at different time, record the time
stamp for each individual solution.




4\. Removed vessel(s) from the incubator     14:24   a/pm

Note: treat the conditions separately

5\. Washed the vessel(s) with dPBS (warmed).

6\. Added     10    mL tryple to each vessel/well and incubated at 37˚C.

  1. Start/Finish for TrypLE was     14:33 - 14:56 a/pm 

7\. Neutralised with     10     dPBS and combined cell suspension into a
50mL tube for each flask

8\. Centrifuged at 650 x g for 5 min.

  1. Start/Finish time for centrifugation was     15:07 - 15:12  pm 




9\. Aspirated the supernatant(s).

10\. Resuspended pellet(s) in     2    mL      each GM    media  

11\. Aliquoted      2 x 10 ul   of resuspended cells into a microcentrifuge
tube for cell count.

12\. Performed a cell count using the haemocytometer and recorded counts in
"Seed Calculator" widget (see below):

  

first is Vit C = 2434666 cells

second is no treatment = 2043999 cells

this constitutes a 1.2x improvement in yield over the control conditions




13\. Transferred       1.198    ml of cell suspension to the pre-warmed
210    mL Growth media

13\. Transferred       1.209    ml of cell suspension to the pre-warmed
210    mL Growth media \+ p38i  

  

14\. Transferred cell suspension into the         7 x T175    pre-gelatin
coated    vessel.

15\. Left at RT in the BSC for 30 min to allow cells to settle      16:08  \-
16:38 pm  

16\. Transferred vessel(s) to incubate at:

  * [x]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells) thermo incubator
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (avian cells)




Observations/Summary:

Thew away remaining ~1M cells for each conditrion. (user did not expect such a
high cell count, and did not prepare enough flask for seeding the full amount)

Version Change Log

NameChange Details  
V1 (original)N/A  
V2Changed all sentences to past tense to better reflect a hand-written lab
book entry.  
Various formatting changes.  
Addition of more detail to step 2, removal of step 3. Replaced volume
requirements table with updated volumes @Sep 22, 2020  
Updated temperature selection for mammalian/aviary cells @Sep 23, 2020  
V3Included a section for 'vessel type' in passage ID table Replace
'flask/plate' with 'vessel' throughout lab book Include at step 1 to take
image of vessel on the microscope

Added timepoint at step 4 for when vessel is removed from incubator  
Include at step 11 to aliquot cell resuspension into microcentrifuge tube  
Included at step 10 and 13 time point for when cell pellet is resuspended and
when resuspended cells is moved into growth media.  
Included p38i in table of regent used  
Combined two dPBS entries in 'Media/reagents' table Added 'cell density per
vessel'
