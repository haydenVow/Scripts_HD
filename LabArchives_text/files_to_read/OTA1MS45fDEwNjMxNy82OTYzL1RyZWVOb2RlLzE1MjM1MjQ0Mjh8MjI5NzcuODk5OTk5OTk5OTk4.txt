### Process: Passage and seed  

  1. Observed vessels under the microscope (could not image as image capture not working).
  2. Aliquoted seeding media, PBS and Tryple and then placed all aliquots in 37C water bath for a minimum of 20 minutes prior to use
  3. Removed vessel(s) from the incubator
  4. Washed the vessel(s) with dPBS (warmed).
  5. Added    10 (T175s) or 100mL (2CF)   mL tryple to each vessel/well and incubated at 37ËšC for 10min (OptiPro cultures) 15min (KSR cultures).
  6. Neutralised with    10 (T175s) or 100mL (2Cf)   dPBS and combined cells from each group into seperate      50ml   tubes.
  7. Centrifuged at 650 x g for 5 min.
  8. Aspirated the supernatant(s).
  9. Resuspended pellet(s) in 5-10mL PBS.   

  10. Note: KSR flasks had considerable cell clumping that could not be broken apart with a pippet. They were filters through a 70um cell strainer to obtain a single cell suspension prior to the count. It is likely that a significant number of cells were lost during this process.   

  11. Took 2x 30-50ul aliquots from each condition, and performed trypan blue counts

  12. For each group, 3 x E125 flasks were seeded, and the remaining cells were banked as MCBs. One with each of the following medias  
OptiPRO + 0.2% Pluronic + 2mM Glutamax  
CDM4 Avian + 2.5mM Glutamax  
Nuvonis supension media  
BOBBO: 6M cells seeded into E-125 flasks (only 1M cells per flask due to low
numbers of cells harvested). Remaining cells frozen in 7 vials as MCB in
Cryostor.  
BOBBK: 6M cells seeded into E-125 flasks (only 1M cells per flask due to low
numbers of cells harvested). Remaining cells frozen in 3 vials as MCB in
Cryostor.  
BIRDYO: 3M cells seeded into E-125 flasks (only 1M cells per flask due to low
numbers of cells harvested). Remaining cells frozen in 2 vials as MCB in
Cryostor.  
BIRDYK: 3M cells seeded into E-125 flasks (1M cells per flask, had intended to
seed 2M per vial, but seeded 1M in error). Remaining cells frozen in 6 vials
as MCB in Cryostor.
