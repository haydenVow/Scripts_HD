Process:

1\. Aliquotted   350mL  mL of  Growth Media into  1x250mL container (250mL)
and 1x120mL container (100mL)     container(s). Placed in water bath   16:01
a/pm

2\. Removed  50  % of supernatant from vessel.

  * One filter cap was removed and thesupernatant was poured into a 250mL container up to the 150mL mark. The container was emptied into the waste collection bottle. Supernatant was then poured into the 250mL container up to the 200mL mark before being emptied once more. 

3\. Replaced with  350 mL (per well/per vessel) of  growth   media.

4\. Screwed the filter caps back onto the vessel, placed the vessel along one
of its longest edges and waited for the media to equilibrate across all levels
of the flask.

4\. Transferred the vessel to incubate at: [16:23]

  * [x]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (aviary cells)

  

  * Incubator (#78  ), Lab [Main/Library/Production]




### Observations/Summary:

  * Visualising confluence inside the flask was challenging. The cells were barely visible when inspected on the primovert without the condenser under any objective (condenser removed due to the size of the flask)
