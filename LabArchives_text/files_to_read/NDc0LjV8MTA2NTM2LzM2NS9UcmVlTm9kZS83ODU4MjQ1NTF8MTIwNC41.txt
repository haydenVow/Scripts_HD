Results:

The average weight of collagen coating is: 0.079867g

Results from the continuous culture experiment (not accounting for collagen
coating weight):

  

The same results but with the weight of the collagen coating subtracted from
the pellet weight of collagen coated flasks:

  

Overall Findings:

  * Collagen coating accounted for a lot of the pellet weight seen in the continuous culture experiments. 
  * VitC treatment appears to still be beneficial in increasing the final yield weight compared to other conditions, however it is not more than was seen in the uncoated VitC seeded flasks. Therefore, it does not seem worth the cost and effort
