Process:

  1. Aspirated supernatant and washed each well 3 times with    uL   PBS.
  2. Added     uL   Janus Green Stain (0.3% solution in PBS) per well, sufficient to cover the cells/scaffolds.
  3. Incubated at RT for 5 minutes:  
  :  \-  :  a/pm  
  4. Removed dye, wash 5 times with    uL   deionized water each wash or until excess dye is removed (cells will remain light blue due to dye absorption to mitochondria).
  5. Removed last water wash, add    uL  0.5 M HCl (just enough to cover the cells/scaffolds) and incubate for 10 min.  
  :  \-  :  a/pm  

  6. Transferred    50uL   of the stained supernatant into the wells of an untreated 96 well plate.  
Do not use cell culture treated 96 well plate!

  7. Spun down plate in centrifuge for 1 min at 1000 rpm to remove bubbles and droplets
  8. Read absorbance at 605 nm using the NanoStar plate reader (preset).
  9. Wrap assay plate in parafilm and store in fridge if needed.
