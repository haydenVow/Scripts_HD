Procedure - Harvest

### Cell Harvest

  1. Turn on water bath and set temperature to 37C.
  2. Take the flasks for harvest and observe under the microscope at 4x objective for even cell distribution . Refer to VSOP-006. Take 2-3 images per flask.
  3. Aliquot required volume of dPBS (37C), dPBS (ambient temp) and TrypLE in separate sterile pots.  Refer to Table below for required volume.
  4. Place aliquots in pre-warmed water bath and leave for ~20 minutes or until warmed. Note: Ensure TrypLE is thoroughly warmed.
  5. Transfer aliquots and flasks required for harvest into the BSC.
  6. Collect growth media and loose aggregates from each flask.
  7. Wash with warmed dPBS, then collect this also.
  8. Add TrypLE to each of the flasks. Mix thoroughly to ensure coverage of the surface area.
  9. Place in the incubator at 37C. After 10 minutes, remove flasks and observe for 95-100% dissociation of cells. Incubate further until maximum dissociation level is reached.  
     NOTE: The flasks must be removed from the incubator within 18 minutes of initial incubation of TrypLE containing flasks
  10. Aspirate the TrypLE solution and collect into 250mL centrifuge tubes.
  11. Add ambient temperature dPBS to each flask as a final wash. To effectively remove remaining cells adhered to the flasks, mix thoroughly and then pour the dPBS into 250mL centrifuge tubes.
  12. Centrifuge at 700 x g for 5 minutes.````
  13. Meanwhile remove aggregates from collected growth media and dPBS via carefully aspiration with a serological pipette and place them into a 250mL centrifuge tube.
  14. Centrifuge this also at 700 x g for 5 minutes.
  15. Gently remove centrifuge tubes from the machine, ensuring not to disturb the cell pellets. Aspirate as much supernatant as possible from the tubes. Discard supernatant. Remove as much remaining supernatant with a 1mL pipette.

### Re-pellet and Weigh Final Yield

  1. Label and Record the weight of 1 sterile centrifuge tube and set aside. Record details in Widget.  
  2. Add growth media to each centrifuge tube and resuspend cells. Refer to the table below for the required amount of growth media to be added.
  3. Combine all resuspended cells into the weighed centrifuge tube. 
  4. Wash all empty centrifuge tubes with growth media and add this to the centrifuge tube containing the resuspended cells. 
  5. Centrifuge at 700 x g x 5 minutes. 
  6. Aspirate the supernatant from the tube. Remove as much remaining supernatant with a 1mL pipette.
  7. Record the final weight of the cell pellet. Enter details in Widget.

Note/observations:

  1. In the final pellets, the supernatant was extremely difficult to remove entirely from the two vitamin C treated pellets due to the aggregates forming large sheets/membranes of cells. The sheets/membranes often were difficult to tell apart from the supernatant close to the main pellet and often clogged the 1000 uL pipette in the fine removal stage. I removed as much as possible to the point where the main pellet aggregates (noodle like structures) were clearly visible on the top surface of the pellets, but there remained some proportion of liquid still in the pellets in these VitC treated tubes due to this. 
  2. The final spins revealed that the membranous portions of the VitC treated samples had trapped air bubbles and these had caused the sheets to fail to pellet fully on the first spin at 700g. I took the vitC treated tubes back into the BSC and attempted to pop the bubbles in the membrane with a pipette with mixed success. I then repeated the spin for these two sample tubes at 1200g. The pellet for 7641 (vitC #2) had one larger air bubble remaining and this was holding up a large strand of cell membrane. I removed the supernatant around this section and did my best to remove all of the liquid, but I think that a large proportion of the difference in weight between 7640 and 7641 is due to excess liquid trapped in the pellet because of this errant bubble/sheet.
