AIM/PURPOSE: Expand F_CHOMP09 MCB cells to a WCB of  ≥ 2 billion cells.

HYPOTHESIS: Continued culture of an initial population of 2.5M F_CHOMP09 MCB
cells will allow for a bank of  ≥ 2 billion cells within 4 passages.

AIM/PURPOSE: Expand F_CHOMP09 MCB cells to a WCB of  ≥ 2 billion cells.

HYPOTHESIS:  Continued culture of an initial population of 2.5M F_CHOMP09 MCB
cells will allow for a bank of  ≥ 2 billion cells within 4 passages.

RESULTS SUMMARY:  The hypothesis was supported, a WCB of 2.2 billion cells was
generated from a starting population of approximately 2.5M cells, over 4
passages. This took the form of 130x 15M vials and 25x 10M vials. The average
cell doubling time over the course of the expansion was 2.89 days.

CONCLUSIONS:  A WCB of 2.2 billion F_CHOMP09 cells was banked.

NEXT STEPS: The  F_CHOMP09 WCB will be used by Production and Science teams.
When this WCB has been exhausted, additional MCB to WCB expansions may be
required. In the event of total F_CHOMP09 depletion, F_CHOMP07 offers a viable
alternative.
