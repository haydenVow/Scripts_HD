Growth Media:

  * [x]  DMEM/F12 + 20% FBS + 1X P/S + P38i (10uM)




### Process:

1\. Took image of vessel with microscope on phase setting. Could not image
flasks today as the imaging station was inoperable. Contacted the engineering
team about the issue.

2\. Gelatin coated     2     x    T75     and    1     x    T25      vessels
with sterile filtered 0.1% gelatin solution and then incubated all coated
flasks at 37˚C.

  1. Time when all vessels(s) placed into the incubator       9:52   a/pm 

3\. Aliquotted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then
placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath for a minimum of 20 minutes
prior to use:

  1. TrypLE:     6    mL in     1x15    tubes
  2.  dPBS (for washing and neutralising):     6    mL in    1x15    tubes
  3. Growth media (for seeding):      2x15 and 1x5    mL in    15mL     tubes  

Time that all aliquots were placed in the water bath the warm before use
10:00   a/pm

Note: if aliquots were placed in water bath at different time, record the time
stamp for each individual solution.




4\. Removed vessel(s) from the incubator     10:18   a/pm

5\. Washed the vessel(s) with dPBS (warmed).

6\. Added     2    mL tryple to each vessel/well and incubated at 37˚C.

  1. Start/Finish for TrypLE was     10:21-10:37   a/pm 

7\. Neutralised with      2    dPBS and combined cell suspension into a     15
tube.

8\. Centrifuged at 650 x g for 5 min.

  1. Start/Finish time for centrifugation was     10:44-10:59   a/pm 




9\. Aspirated the supernatant(s).

10\. Resuspended pellet(s) in  their respective seeding media.     10:55:
a/pm




13\. Transferred  cell suspensions to their respective flasks. See

for vessel sizes and locations.  

15\. Left at RT in the BSC for 30 min to allow cells to settle      10:59  \-
11:29 a/pm  

16\. Transferred vessel(s) to incubate at:

  * [x]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells), incubator #78
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (avian cells)

24wp cultures were discarded (cultures 7037 and 7038

Observations/Summary:

\- Wells A1, A2 and A3 look ready for passage (confluence >30%). Well A1 and
A2 appear 80% confluent, therefore I plan to expand them to T75 flasks instead
of T25 flasks. Well A3 looked within the 30-50% confluent range so I'll expand
it up to a T25.
