Observations

In cultures containing adhesion peptides, It was very difficult to
discriminate between live and dead cells with trypan blue staining today.
There appeared to be a large number of non-viable cells in all cultures
however several of these had the classic glowing halo of viable cells, but
with apparently trypan blue stained core which is typical of dead or dying
cells.

Process:  

  1. Place media in water bath >15min prior to use
  2. Collected vessels from shaker, wiped with ethanol-sprayed Rediwipe, and brought into BSC 
  3. Centrifuged 50 mL tubes at 400 x g for 5 mins 
  4. Aspirated  80% (8mL) of supernatant, taking extra care to not disrupt or aspirate pellet.
  5. Resuspended each pellet in the remaining 5mL of media, and took 2x 10ul samples from each culture for hemocytometer counts 
  6. Performed  hemocytometer counts (see below for counts).
  7. Topped up each 50 mL centrifuge tube with 8 mL of fresh pre-warmed media.
  8. Pipette-mixed cultures.
  9. Returned to incubator, 210RPM

incubator 160 Library Lab, 37C, 5% CO2
