### Process:

1\. Inspected wells under the microscope, 5x objective to observe which clones
were 100% confluent. Wells 100% confluent were set up for passage below.

2\. Filled one well on a 6 well plate with 3mL of growth media (DMEM/F12 + 20%
FBS + 1xP/S) for each clone destined to be picked.




Plates were passaged on 12/4/22 as per the protocol below.

3\. Plates were removed from the incubator and all supernatant was aspirated
and discarded.

4\. Wells were washed with 50-100uL of dPBS, washes were then discarded and
replaced with 200uL of Tryple+EDTA before plates were returned to incubate at
30 degrees, 5% CO2 for 8-12 minutes.

5\. 200uL of dPBS was added to each well to neutralise the tryple, 100uL from
each well was collected and transferred to a PCR tube. The remaining well
contents were collected and transferred to individual wells on a destination
plates containing growth media. destination plates were then returned to the
incubator (#82, 30 degrees C, 5% CO2).

6\. PCR tubes were spun for 5 minutes in the microfuge, supernatant was then
discarded, Suspected that the pellets had been aspirated, Should probably take
another DNA sample on next passage for these clones
