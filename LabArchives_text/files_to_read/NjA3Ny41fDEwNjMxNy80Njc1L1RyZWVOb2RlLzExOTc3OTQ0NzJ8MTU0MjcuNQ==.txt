For the remaining 30 days of this experiment, these 12 suspension cultures
will be run concurrently with the 12 suspension cultures from EPIC25749. See

Process:

  * Prepared stain buffer in 15 mL amber or black tube by combining the following:
  * 4 mL of dPBS 
  * 16 drops of NucBlue Live Cell Stain Readyflow Hoechst 33342
  * 4 drops of NucGreen Dead 488 Cell Stain ReadyProbes Sytox Green
    * Vortex mix for ~5 seconds, then stored in dark until ready to use  

50 mL shake tubes

  1. Paused shaker by pressing the "play" button on the controller on the side wall of the incubator
  2. Collected shake tubes from shaker 
  3. Centrifuged at 300 x g for 5 min
    1. Timestamp  
  4. While tubes were centrifuging, loaded protocol linked below (added protocol as attachment) on computer next to OT2 and set up deck as described at calibration step
  5. Ethanol-sprayed  shake tubes and loaded on OT2
  6. Collected media aliquots from water bath, ethanol-sprayed, and loaded on OT2 deck. Ensured that media aliquot deck positions matched up with intended feed tube positions. 
  7. Calibrated the pipet head
  8. Ran protocol  
    1.  Start time 1:02:37 PM
    2.  End time 1:27 PM  

    3. Total run time: 01:25:24
  9. Replaced caps and returned vessels to incubator      
Incubator (#), Lab [Main/Library/Production]

  10. Stained samples with equal volume of stain buffer (50% sample dilutions) :
  11. Incubated for 30 minutes in the dark at room temperature 
  12. Made 25% and 12.5% dilutions of the sample in dPBS :  

  13. Centrifuged plates at 300 RCF for 1 minute  
  14. Plate map of culture IDs in 96-WP for imaging
