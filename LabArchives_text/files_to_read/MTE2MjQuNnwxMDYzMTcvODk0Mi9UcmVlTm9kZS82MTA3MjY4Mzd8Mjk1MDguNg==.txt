Methods and Experiment Layout


Aim 1: Determine the optimal centrifugation time for the pelleting of the cell
supply prior to creating.  
  
Experiment Plan

We will seed four moulds with 9 tissues each at a cell density of 40 million
cells per mL (finding of current max density with "well-formed" tissues from
experiment 4).

Tissues will be created via 4 different approaches to centrifuging the cells
prior to creating the tissue gel and seeding into the moulds.

  1. 500g for 5 minutes in 500mL centrifuge tubes 
  2. 1200g for 5 minutes in 500mL centrifuge tubes 
  3. 300g in 50mL falcon tubes 
  4. 500g for 5 minutes in 500mL centrifuge tubes, then resuspend in a small volume and recentrifuge at 300g for 5 minutes in 50mL falcon tubes

Tissues will be cultured for 5 days in Pen/Strep, changed to P/S free media
for 2 days and harvested after 7 days.

Tissues will be used for immunoanalysis, flow cytometry, molecular analysis
and product testing.

## Matrix formation for scaffold seeding -

N.B. Repeat this gel formation for each falcon tube at the same time - i.e.
Add Collagen to all, then add DMEM to all etc. - BUT be sure to move quickly!
Refer to Figure 2 to visualise the workflow.

1. Remove pluronic from the wells.

Condition: 40M cells/mL (n=9) per condition (mL)  
Step 1. Aliquot cells+media for 1 condition  
  
(n= 9   tissues)17.424  
 Step 2. Add total Collagen (mL)  
14.616  
Step 3. Add total 10xDMEM/F12  
  
(mL)1.764  
Step 4. Add total 0.1M NaOH  
(mL)2.196  
Step 5. Pipette matrix into each well  
(mL)4mL per well (into 9 wells)  
  
2\. Add Collagen I (Devro: final concentration 2.6mg/ml) and mix well with
stripette (not resuspending!):

3\. Add 10xDMEM/F12 and mix with stripette.

4\. Add 0.1M Sodium Hydroxide and mix with stripette:

5\. Seed    4mL    gel/matrix gently into scaffold ensuring good distribution
around pillars in the well. Repeat for each treatment condition plate.

6. Leave for    60-90    minutes to gel at 37°C - start time   \- : -   

7\. Add   ~150-200mL   50-50 Media with or w/o TGF-b to entire 15mL dish,
ensure entire mould is covered.

8. Culture at 37°C overnight before checking.

# Tips and Tricks for this Protocol:

  * When pelleting cells, make sure they are completely dry
  * Flick pellet to dislodge before adding medium
  * Add Medium first to pellet to prevent clumping and cell death
  * Col1 is very viscous, pipette carefully - when adding 10x DMEM, it turns yellow
  * As soon as you add the NaOH, be quick as the Col starts to gel
  * Everything has to be exact, don't be tempted to add more cells than the volume stated if there are some left
  * Add cells slowly!
