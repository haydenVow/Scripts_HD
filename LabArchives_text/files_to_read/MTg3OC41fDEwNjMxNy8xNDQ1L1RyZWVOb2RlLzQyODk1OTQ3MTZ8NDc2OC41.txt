## Feed performed by:  




Growth Media:

  * [X ]  DMEM/F12 + 20% FBS + 1X P/S
  * [X ]  DMEM/F12 + 20% FBS + 1X P/S + 1:100 Anti-clumping agent
  * [X ]  DMEM/F12 + 20% FBS + 1X P/S + 1:500 Anti-clumping agent
  * [X ]  DMEM/F12 + 20% FBS + 1X P/S + 1:100 RevitaCell

  

  

Media are aliquotted in 10mL aliquots in fridge #104 of Library Lab




Process:

1\. Place the pre-aliquotted  10 mL  mL of each respective type of Growth
Media into the water bath    09:22 am

Take observations (below) of the 4 x shake tubes in incubator #67. Stop
shaking platform to collect tubes and then restart after returning tubes to
tube rack

2\. Placed shake tubes in centrifuge and centrifuge at 650 x g for 5 min at
RT.     09:37 am

Aspirated supernatant from each pellet *Note, allow a buffer of ~0.5mL to
ensure no cells are aspriated

Added 1mL of respective growth media to each tube and used a P1000 pipette to
break up cell clumps. (pipette up and down ~10 times)

Remaining 9mL of each respective media was added afterwards and triturated
with 10mL serological pipette to break up cell clumps for each culture further
and resuspend cells evenly.

4\. Returned vessel to incubate at:    09:54 am  Shaking at 206 RPM

  * [X ]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (aviary cells)

  

  * Incubator (#67 ), Lab [Library]




  

Observations:

Upon collecting the tubes from the shaking platform, tubes were observed.  
Any clumps / aggregates / cloudy suspension / other observations?

1:100 anti-clumping - LOADS of clumps present, too many to count, all pretty
uniform in size. No cloudiness. No visible sediment on the very bottom of the
tube.

1:500 anti-clumping -  Clumps present - up to ~6 counted, one quite large one
and the others which were much smaller. No cloudiness. No visible sediment on
the very bottom of the tube.

1:100 RevitaCell - Clumps present (3 to 5 counted - one quite large one and
two much smaller bits). No cloudiness. A visible sediment on the very bottom
of the tube that appeared stuck to the surface of the tube.

Serum control -  2 bigger clumps, one very small one visible. Sediment also
present on the bottom of the tube. Media is not cloudy.
