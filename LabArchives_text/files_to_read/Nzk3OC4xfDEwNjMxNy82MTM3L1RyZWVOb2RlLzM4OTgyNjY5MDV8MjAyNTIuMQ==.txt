Prepare reagents:

  1. prepare 'serum free media' 
    * 100 mL 50% (v/v) DMEM; 
    * 100 mL 50% (v/v) F/12; 
    * (should be topped up with 50mL FBS - make without and indicate that FBS needs to be added before use on label)
    * filter-sterilise 0.22µm
  2. prepare saline solution (for reconstitution of fibrinogen)
    * 90mg/10mL dH2O (or 900mg in 100mL if this is too small to weigh out)
  3. reconstitute fibrinogen (5g stock) according to manufacturer's instruction:
    * reconstitute in saline solution (0.9% NaCl) heated to 37°C
    * 20mg/mL stock concentration
      * weighed out fibrinogen: 212mg
      * made up to correct concentration (20mg/mL) filter-sterilised MilliQ-water -> measured out 10.6mL filter-sterilised MilliQ water into specimen jar
      * placed fibrinogen dessicate on top of water and allowed to dissolve into the water at room temperature
      * gently swirled occassionally
      * chilled at 4°C  

  4. reconstitute thrombin (1000U stock) according to manufacturer's instruction:
    * reconstituted entire amount (9.9mg) in chilled water
      * 125µL total filter-sterilised MilliQ water to reconstitute entire amount
      * 1000U/125uL = 8U/uL (0.0792mg/uL)
  5. prepare 3.3% (w/v) alginate 
    * 330mg in 10mL dH2O
    * microwave (or hot plate)
    * cool to 4°C
  6. prepare 60mL 200mM CaCl2 
    * 1332mg dissolved in 60mL SFM
    * filter-sterilise 0.22µm 
  7. prepare 1.5% (w/v) agarose in DMEM solution
    * 1.5g agarose in DMEM
    * heat to boiling point and agarose dissolved

Process  

  1. Prepare 24 well plate as per table below (x4 replicates of each condition are plated in each column moving down the plate):

  
1 (Condition A)2 (Condition B)3 (Condition C)4 (Condition D)5 (Condition E)6  
A  
  
  
  
  
  
  
B  
  
  
  
  
  
  
C  
  
  
  
  
  
  
D  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
3\. Add 2mL serum-free media per well to columns 1 (Condition A) and 2
(Condition B)

4\. Add 2mL serum-free CaCl media to columns 3-5 (Conditions C/D/E)

5\. To each well, add 3uL thrombin (final concentration: 12U/mL)

Thaw CHOMP cells as per entry here. Cell count for vial: 9.3x10^6 (labelled as
15x10^6)

6\. Label eppendorf tubes A-E

7\. As per table below, add to eppendorf tubes in the following order: media,
cell suspension, alginate solution, fibrinogen. Draw up alginate in syringe
and then afix needle. Dispense using syringe/needle combination, using
graduations on syringe to measure. Mix gently (stir with pipette tip end) and
allow bubbles to dissipate. Prepared a single condition at a time until
completion and plating before preparing the following condition

8\. Remove plunger from syringe with needle. Used 20 guage needle. Add
suspension to plunger and then replaced plunger. Carefully dispense drop-wise
suspension to wells containing media below. Disperse drops evenly between
wells. NOTE: this is finicky.

9\. Incubate in hood at room temperature for 15 minutes

10\. Seed remaining CHOMP cells into T75 flask at 7500 cells/cm2 in 20% FBS
DF12 and return to incubation

11\. Aspirate media from wells using a syringe and needle and discard. Replace
with new 20% FBS-containing growth media, incubate at 30°C

  

Stored in Thermo incubator #82, main lab, 30°C static

Plate IDs:

24-well plate: 10165  

T75 flask: 10164




Observations:

  * in fibrinogen/thrombin containing wells, reaction proceeded very quickly and media began to cross-link in addition to micromass 'beads' containing cells. Was able to be pipetted off, but future experiment runs should reduce incubation time following dropping cells into media
  * beads containing cells were very large. Perhaps best to use a smaller gauge needle for future iterations
