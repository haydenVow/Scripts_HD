Process:  

  1. Aliquotted  8 mL  of  10C Media and  3 mL  of  serum-containing Media into  2 x 15 mL    tube(s). Placed in water bath   15:38  
  2. Added media to respective wells after Zaber imaging to make up to 230 uL per well of media 
  3.  ~~Using a sterile tweezers (autoclaved metal pointy tweezers), carefully transfer each scaffold over to the new plate (eg 24 - well 04 48 well with plate inserts) containing growth media.  ~~
    1.  ~~Use a 50 mL falcon tube in the BSC to hold the tweezers and maintain sterility between use (easier than putting back into autoclave bag)  ~~
    2.  ~~have the new plate side-by-side touching the previous plate during transfer, so if the scaffold drops during transfer it is likely to drop within the new sterile plate.~~
    3.  ~~when transferring scaffolds try to pinch a small area on outside edge of scaffold, do not fold the whole scaffold between tweezers as the scaffold is prone to break.  ~~
    4.  ~~when transferring scaffolds in the BSC do so towards the centre of the BSC, when working too close to the filter the movement of air can blow thin/light scaffolds and result in scaffolds being blown away/dropped. Working too close to the filter is also not best practise from a sterility perspective.~~  

  4. Returned vessel to incubate at: 

  * [x]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (aviary cells)

  

  * Incubator (Thermo)
  * Lab [Main/Library/Production]
