Cell factory Process

  1. Unscrew white cap and remove blue cap and place aside.
  2. Removed  `100` % of supernatant (300 mL) from 1 x 2CF by carefully pouring all the waste media out. 
  3. Replaced with  `300` mL (per flask) of  `growth`   media by carefully pouring media through the white cap opening (alternatively you may use a 50mL serological to add media.)
  4. Place caps back and equalise 2CF by placing it on its side (blue cap on the bottom and white cap on the top, see image below:)  
  

4\. Returned vessel to incubate at:

  * [x]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (aviary cells)
