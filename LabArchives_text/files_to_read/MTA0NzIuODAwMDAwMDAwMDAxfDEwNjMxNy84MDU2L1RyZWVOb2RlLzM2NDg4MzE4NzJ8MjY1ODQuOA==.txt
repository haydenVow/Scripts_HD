RELATED TO OKR:  Release of first product & 1-tonne scale up

AIM/PURPOSE: to pilot test chemical flocculation methods to improve the
efficiency and speed of harvesting cells from large volumes (>10L) of cell
suspension broth

HYPOTHESIS: Addition of flocculants will reduce the number of cells in
supernatant compared to control conditions where no flocculants are added to
the broth

RESULTS SUMMARY:  Normalised and time-matched data show the largest reduction
in supernatant cell number occured in the Chitosan 40 mg/L condition.
