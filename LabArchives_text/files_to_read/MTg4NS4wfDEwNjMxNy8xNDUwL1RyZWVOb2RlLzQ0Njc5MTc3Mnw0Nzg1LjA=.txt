RELATED TO MILESTONE:  N/A. Related to company-wide milestone of generating
100g of product per week.

AIM/PURPOSE: To see if we can increase our product mass by putting fibroblasts
through a 2 week "maturation" process during which ECM production is
encouraged.

HYPOTHESIS: Treatment of overconfluent fibroblasts with 5ng/mL TGFb and
50ug/mL Vitamin C for 2 weeks will lead to formation of fibroblast sheets with
more mass than fibroblast sheets generated with 24h of treatment.

RESULTS SUMMARY: See report

CONCLUSIONS: See report
