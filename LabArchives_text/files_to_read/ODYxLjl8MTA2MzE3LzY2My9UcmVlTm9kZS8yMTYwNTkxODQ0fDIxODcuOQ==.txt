### Prepared materials:

1\. Aliquotted the required volume of each reagent and then placed all
aliquots to warm in the water bath for a minimum of 20 minutes prior to use:

  1. dPBS (for washing before Trypsinization), 100 mL per g Cytodex 1:     30    mL in     1 X 50mL    tubes
  2. Trypsin/EDTA, 100 mL per g Cytodex 1:     30    mL in    3 x 10mL     tubes
  3. Growth media (for neutralizing) 100 mL per g Cytodex 1:     30    mL in     1 x 50ml    tubes

Time that all aliquots were placed in the water bath the warm before use
15:51   a/pm

Note: if aliquots were placed in water bath at different time, record the time
stamp for each individual solution.




## Sample and stain:

  1. Removed flask from incubator and sampled 20uL of culture from evenly mixed microcarrier solution
  2. Added 80uL of dPBS and mixed with a P200 pipette.
  3. Added 2uL of Hoescht stain and incubated for 15 mins 15:49 - 16:05

## First wash to remove serum:

  1. Allow the microcarriers to settle for at least 2 minutes
  2. Gently tilt the flask to an angle of approximately 30 degrees from vertical
  3. Remove the cap and aspirate the supernatant using a serological pipet - keep the tip only 5-10 mm below the surface during this procedure
  4. Transfer half of the fresh, pre-warmed dPBS fro prewashing to the flask using a serological pipet - wash down the insides to wash any stuck microcarriers back into the bulk suspension, then replace the cap

  




## Second wash to remove serum:

  1. Allow the microcarriers to settle for at least 2 minutes
  2. Gently tilt the flask to an angle of approximately 30 degrees from vertical
  3. Remove the cap and aspirate the supernatant using a serological pipet - keep the tip only 5-10 mm below the surface during this procedure
  4. Transfer the remaining half of the fresh, pre-warmed dPBS for prewashing to the flask using a serological pipet - wash down the insides to wash any stuck microcarriers back into the bulk suspension, then replace the cap

  




## Add detachment agent:

  1. Allow the microcarriers to settle for at least 2 minutes
  2. Gently tilt the flask to an angle of approximately 30 degrees from vertical
  3. Remove the cap and aspirate the supernatant using a serological pipet - keep the tip only 5-10 mm below the surface during this procedure
  4. Transfer the fresh, pre-warmed Trypsin/EDTA solution to the flask using a serological pipet - wash down the insides to wash any stuck microcarriers back into the bulk suspension, then replace the cap

  




## Incubate flask:

  1. Stop the shaker
  2. Remove the flask from the BSC and transfer it back to the shaker
  3. Restart the shaker at the `speed required for detachment` \- see the table below.
  4. After `7-15 `minutes, stop the shaker 16:16 - 16:24
  5. Remove the flask from the shaker
  6. Restart the shaker
  7. Wipe down the flask with an ethanol-soaked wipe and place it in the BSC

## Neutralize the detachment reagent:

  1. Add fresh, pre-warmed growth medium to the flask
  2. Mix the suspension vigorously
  3. Allow the microcarriers to settle for at least 2 minutes
  4. Gently tilt the flask to an angle of approximately 30 degrees from vertical
  5. Remove the cap and transfer the supernatant to centrifuge tubes using a serological pipet - keep the tip only 5-10 mm below the surface during this procedure

  




## First wash to recover additional cells:

  1. Transfer half of the fresh, pre-warmed dPBS solution to the flask using a serological pipet - wash down the insides to wash any stuck microcarriers back into the bulk suspension
  2. Pipet-mix the suspension vigorously
  3. Allow the microcarriers to settle for at least 2 minutes
  4. Gently tilt the flask to an angle of approximately 30 degrees from vertical
  5. Remove the cap and transfer the supernatant to centrifuge tubes using aserological pipet - keep the tip only 5-10 mm below the surface during this procedure

  




## Second wash to recover additional cells:

  1. Transfer half of the fresh, pre-warmed dPBS solution to the flask using a serological pipet - wash down the insides to wash any stuck microcarriers back into the bulk suspension
  2. Pipet-mix the suspension vigorously
  3. Allow the microcarriers to settle for at least 2 minutes
  4. Gently tilt the flask to an angle of approximately 30 degrees from vertical
  5. Remove the cap and transfer the supernatant to centrifuge tubes using aserological pipet - keep the tip only 5-10 mm below the surface during this procedure

  




# Optional: sieve cell suspension to remove microcarriers

  1. Pass the cell suspension through a 40 - 100 um pore-size sieve to remove any errant microcarriers.




## Recover pellet, prepare suspension for counting and subculture:

  1. Centrifuge the tubes at 650 - 700 RCF for 5 minutes
  2. Aspirate supernatants
  3. Resuspend pellets in 1 mL of fresh, pre-warmed growth medium
  4. Combine the cell suspensions into 1x 50 mL centrifuge tube
  5. Wash out each tube with the remainder of the fresh, pre-warmed growth medium and combine with the cell suspension

  




## Performed cell count:

  1. Aliquoted     20uL     of resuspended cells into a microcentrifuge tube for cell count.
  2. Performed a cell count using the haemocytometer and recorded the cell count data in the Google Doc spreadsheet called 'Cell Count Spreadsheet' (see link below):

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1DPzKubYxfHmWogVPihC-
SSIBtIylyrBQE5kRX5Z8NtI/edit#gid=0

  1.  Total cell number was:     2818000       

  2. Volume of cell suspension required for subculture was:      All      

  3. Cell density per vessel:    93933 cells/mL        




Added all cell suspension to E125 flask containing microcarriers at 4.5mg/mL
(equilibrated for more than 1 day).  
began 6h shaking (intermittent 2min on, 28 min off) at 5:00. Finished at
~22:25.

Observations/Summary:

\- poloxomer looks promising to improve cell harvests. Added during dPBS wash
steps.

\- Orange/Pink colour of serum containing media in the past has somewhat
retained in previous dPBS washes, however with poloxamer containing dPBS - on
the final wash step a clear supernatant is observed.
