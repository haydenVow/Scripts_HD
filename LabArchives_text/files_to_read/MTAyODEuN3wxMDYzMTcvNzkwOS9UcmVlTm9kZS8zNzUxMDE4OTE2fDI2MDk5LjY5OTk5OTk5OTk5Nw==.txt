Process:

  1. Prepared x2 50mL falcon tubes containing 30mL each of Freestyle Nuvonis medium and supplemented with growth factors. Medium was pre-heated.
  2. Removed plates from static incubator at 10:40am. Used serelogical pipette 
  3. Used serelogical pipette to transfer cells to x2 50mL falcon tubes and centrifuged at 310xg for 5 minutes
  4. Aspirated supernatant and resuspended in 5mL newly prepared media (per pellet)
  5. Evenly dispensed cells between x2 E-125 flasks

  




Cell Count:

  1. Sampled 100uL per flask for trypan blue staining & counting
  2. 1:2 trypan blue staining and cell count (manual)
  3. Counts:
    * 12007: 175 000 cell/mL
    * 12008: 85 000 cell/mL
