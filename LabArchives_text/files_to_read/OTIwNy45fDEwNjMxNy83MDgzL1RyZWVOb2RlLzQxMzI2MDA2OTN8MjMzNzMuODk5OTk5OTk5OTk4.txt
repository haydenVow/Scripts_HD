Aim/Purpose


Determine if the type of water (MilliQ [Type 1 water] vs distilled ultrapure
vs RO [type 3 water] vs industrial distilled vs tap water) used to
reconstitute the Hycell CHO media affects the survival and subsequent
proliferation of Nuvonis suspension cells


Hypothesis


No significant differences in Nuvonis cell survival and proliferation will be
observed between Hycell media reconstituted in each of the water treatment
conditions.


Technical Gap


All commercially available media powders used at Vow are reconstituted in
MilliQ (Type 1) water. It is unclear whether Nuvonis suspension cells can
survive in growth media reconstituted in other water types. This experiment
will determine whether the water used to reconstitute powdered growth media
affects cell survival and proliferation.


Method/Procedure


Process:

  1. Prepare 150 mL of Hycell media in each water treatment (see below)
    1. Add 25.4 g/L of Hycell CHO powder, 2.2 g/L of sodium bicarbonate and 1 g/L of poloxamer 188
    2. Stir until dissolved
    3. Sterile filter through a 0.22 um filter unit
  2. Seed 5x E125 flasks with Nuvonis suspension cells (1.5M cells per flask)
    1. Condition 1: Hycell media with MilliQ (Type 1 water)
    2. Condition 2: Hycell media with distilled ultrapure water
    3. Condition 3: Hycell media with reverse osmosis (Type 3 water)
    4. Condition 4: Hycell media with industrial distilled water
    5. Condition 5: Hycell media with tap water
  3. Perform a cell count approximately 24 hours after seeding to assess cell survival
  4. Passage the cells 4 days after seeding and retrieve samples for a total cell count and viability for each condition
  5. Allow the cells to remain in culture for an additional 4 days and perform a final cell count and viability check for each condition
