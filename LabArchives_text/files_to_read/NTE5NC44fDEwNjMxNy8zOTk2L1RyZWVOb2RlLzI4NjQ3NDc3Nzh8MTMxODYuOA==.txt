Aim/Purpose


To test how many times Hoechst can be used in the cloning pipeline to quantify
cells. i.e. To test whether Hoechst staining cells multiple times affects
viability


Hypothesis


Hoechst staining cells 3 times and then passaging them will not affect cell
viability/cell numbers compared to unstained control.


Technical Gap


We have not tried staining cells and passaging them for 3 consecutive
passages.


Method/Procedure


Conditions:

  1. Stained 3 times total: 12 wells stained before all 3 passages. 
  2. Stained 2 times total: 12 wells stained before first 2 passages, unstained for 3rd passage.
    1. 6 wells get 'sacrificed' after 3rd passage for staining to quantify cells
  3. Stained 1 time: 20 wells stained before first passage. Unstained for last 2 passages.
    1. 6 wells get 'sacrificed' after 2nd passage, and 6 more after 3rd passage
  4. Unstained: 33 wells unstained for all 3 passages.
    1. 6 wells get 'sacrificed' after each passage for staining to quantify cells
