Decontaminated bioreactor

  1. Filled all connected bottles with 100 mL of 70% ethanol
  2. Pumped the 70% ethanol through the tubing and into the bioreactor
  3. Cut off the tip of the sampling tube and discarded.
  4. Pumped 50 mL of 70% ethanol back through the sample tube.
  5. Disconnected and removed the pH probe:
    1. Wiped with 70% ethanol
    2. Rinsed with water
    3. Wiped with a lint-free cloth
    4. Filled the storage cap with3.5 M KCl
    5. Replaced the storage cap and stored the probe upright
  6. Disconnected and removed the DO probe:
    1. Wiped with 70% ethanol
    2. Rinsed with water
    3. Wiped with a lint-free cloth
    4. Filled the storage cap with tap water
    5. Replaced the storage cap and stored the probe upright
  7. Disconnected and removed the level probe:
    1. Wiped with 70% ethanol
    2. Rinsed with water
    3. Wiped with a lint-free cloth
    4. Stored the probe in a thickly-padded foam box
  8. Pumped the 70% ethanol out of the bioreactor and into an empty waste bottle.
