Growth Media:

  * [x ]  DMEM/F12 + 10% FBS + 1X P/S 




### Process:

1\. Took image of vessel with microscope on phase setting.  
  

2\. Aliquotted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then
placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath for a minimum of 20 minutes
prior to use:

  1. TrypLE:    30 mL in       1  tube.
  2.  dPBS (for washing):    30    mL in      1  tube.
  3. dPBS (for neutralising):    30   mL in      1  tube.
  4. Growth media (for pellet resuspension):   10   mL in    1     tube.
  5. Growth media (for seeding):   0.810 L in       1 tub (This is all the 10 % FBS media we had left and we have no DMEM in stock so I could not make more media, cells were therefore seeded with slightly less than the recommended volumes)   

Time that all aliquots were placed in the water bath the warm before use
9:45

Note: if aliquots were placed in water bath at different time, record the time
stamp for each individual solution.




4\. Removed vessel(s) from the incubator    11:10

5\. Washed the vessel(s) with dPBS (warmed).

6\. Added     10   mL tryple to each vessel/well and incubated at 37˚C.

  1. Start/Finish for TrypLE was    11: 15- 11:25   

7\. Neutralised with    30ml      dPBS and combined cell suspension into     2
x 50mL   tubes.

8\. Centrifuged at 650 x g for 5 min.

  1. Start/Finish time for centrifugation was     11:30-11:35   




9\. Aspirated the supernatant(s).

10\. Resuspended pellet(s) in    6.5     mL       growth   media     11:45

11\. Aliquoted     2x50ul     of resuspended cells into a microcentrifuge tube
for cell count.

12\. Performed a cell count using the haemocytometer and recorded the cell
count data in the Google Doc spreadsheet called 'Cell Count Spreadsheet' (see
link below):

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1DPzKubYxfHmWogVPihC-
SSIBtIylyrBQE5kRX5Z8NtI/edit#gid=0

  1.  Total cell number was:      6.324M     

  2. Volume of cell suspension required for subculture was:       All      

  3. Cell density per vessel:    830/cm, 2,022,400 per 2CF     




13\. Transferred   8.5mL  of cell suspension to the pre-warmed       0.810   L
Growth media:   12.20  

14\. Transferred cell suspension into 3 x     2CFs  

16\. Transferred vessel(s) to incubate at: 12:40

  * [ x]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)




Media/Reagents used:  

NameDetails (reagent ID)  
Tryple 4949  
  
dPBS (for washing & neutralising) 5617  
  
Growth Media 5722  
  
  
  




Observations/Summary: Cells were more confluent than ideal. Because we only
had 810mL of growth media, and no DMEM to make more, cells were seeded at
270mL per flask instead of the recommended 300mL  

  




### Results:

  * Results were;
    * [ x]  As Usual (this is a repetitive task)
    * [ ]  Unexpected because...
    * [ ]  Need to be further analysed
    * [ ]  Other (.......)
