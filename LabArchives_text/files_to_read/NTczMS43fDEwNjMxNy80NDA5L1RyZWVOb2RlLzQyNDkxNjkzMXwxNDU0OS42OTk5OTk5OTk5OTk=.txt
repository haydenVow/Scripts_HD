### Process:

1\. Took image of vessel with microscope on phase setting.

2\. Gelatin coated     2     x   24 well plates       vessel with sterile
filtered 0.1% gelatin solution and then incubated all coated flasks at 37˚C.

  1. Time when all vessels(s) placed into the incubator       11:23   a/pm 

3\. Aliquotted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then
placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath for a minimum of 20 minutes
prior to use:

  1. TrypLE:         mL in         tubes
  2.  dPBS (for neutralising):         mL
  3.  dPBS (for washing):         mL
  4. Growth media (for pellet resuspension):         mL
  5. Growth media (for seeding):    14     mL 

Time that all aliquots were placed in the water bath the warm before use
15:40   a/pm

Note: if aliquots were placed in water bath at different time, record the time
stamp for each individual solution.




13\. Transferred       728    µl of cell suspension containing 350,000 cells
to the pre-warmed      14     mL Growth media:      15:48    a/pm

14\. Transferred 500uL per well of cell suspension into the pre-gelatin coated
2 x 24 well plates      vessel.

15\. Left at RT in the BSC for 30 min to allow cells to settle      15:53  \-
: a/pm  

16\. Transferred vessel(s) to incubate at:

  * [X]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (avian cells)

Version Change Log

NameChange Details  
V1 (original)N/A  
V2Changed all sentences to past tense to better reflect a hand-written lab
book entry.  
Various formatting changes.  
Addition of more detail to step 2, removal of step 3. Replaced volume
requirements table with updated volumes @Sep 22, 2020  
Updated temperature selection for mammalian/aviary cells @Sep 23, 2020  
V3Included a section for 'vessel type' in passage ID table Replace
'flask/plate' with 'vessel' throughout lab book Include at step 1 to take
image of vessel on the microscope  
Mentioned that dPBS for washing should be warm - step 3(2) and 5.  
Added timepoint at step 4 for when vessel is removed from incubator  
Include at step 11 to aliquot cell resuspension into microcentrifuge tube  
Included at step 10 and 13 time point for when cell pellet is resuspended and
when resuspended cells is moved into growth media.  
Included p38i in table of regent used  
Combined two dPBS entries in 'Media/reagents' table Added 'cell density per
vessel'
