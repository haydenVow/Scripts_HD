Note: Copy the value for 'viable cells per mL' from Vicell  anc record in the
master cell count spreadsheet, with the respective culture ID and the volume
of growth medium the cells are being cultured in.

It was noted that the density of 12504 was lower than expected so a second
Vicell count was taken:

## Steps for harvest and feed of flask 12537 (ZM)

250.4 M cells were harvested from the E500 flasks with a Ranger ID of: 12537
and given to the scaffolds stream. The remaining cells (161M) were placed into
a new flask and topped up with media.

1\. The initial volume, density and total cells of 12537 was noted as 123.9mL,
3.30M cells/mL, 375.4 M cells, respectively.

2\. 158.74mL of 50/50 Hycell/RPMI media was aliquoted to a 500mL container

3\. 0.159mL of IGF and 0.032mL of EGF were added to the 158.74mL of media

4\. 41.26mL of the cells from 12537 were deposited into the 500mL jar
containing 158.74 mL of media (\+ 0.159mL of IGF and 0.032mL of EGF)

5\. The cells and media were then pipetted into a new E500 flask, total
working volume in flask 200mL (41.26 + 158.74)

6\. A cell count was taken using the Vicell before returning to the incubator
at 15:00 (37 C, 5% CO2, 120 RPM):

7\. The remaining 82.64mL (123.9 - 41.26) of cells (3.03M cells/mL, 250.4M
cells) in the original E500 flask were given to the scaffolds stream
experiments

Seed flask details:

  * Seeding density: 0.805 x10^6 cells / mL
  * Growth Medium Volume in the seed flask:  200 mL
  * Flask size: E500 flat bottom
  * Refer to summary table above

## Steps for harvest and feed of flask 12536 (ZM + JD)

240 M cells were harvested from the E500 flasks with a Ranger ID of: 12536 to
be spun down and frozen. The remaining cells (145M) were placed into a new
flask and topped up with media.

1\. The initial volume, density and total cells of 12536 was noted as 115.9mL,
3.15M cells/mL, 365.1 M cells, respectively.

2\. 160.29mL of 50/50 Hycell/RPMI media was aliquoted to a 500mL container

3\. 0.160mL of IGF and 0.032mL of EGF were added to the 160.29mL of media

4\. 39.71mL of the cells from 12536 were deposited into the 500mL jar
containing 160.29 mL of media (\+ 0.160mL of IGF and 0.032mL of EGF)

5\. The cells and media were then pipetted into a new E500 flask, total
working volume in flask 200mL (39.71 + 160.29)

6\. A cell count was taken using the Vicell before returning to the incubator

7\. The remaining 76.19mL (115.9 - 39.71) of cells (3.15M cells/mL, 240 M
cells) in the original E500 flask were centrifuged at 500g for 5 minutes

8\. The remaining cell pellet was harvested, weighed and placed in a -20C
freezer

Seed flask details:

  * Seeding density: 0.725 x10^6 cells / mL
  * Growth Medium Volume in the seed flask:  200 mL
  * Flask size: E500 flat bottom
  * Refer to summary table above

## Cell seeding density experiment 12504 (JD)

 1\. The flask containing the seed density experiment was reseeded at the
following density. The remaining cells were spun down, weighed and frozen.
