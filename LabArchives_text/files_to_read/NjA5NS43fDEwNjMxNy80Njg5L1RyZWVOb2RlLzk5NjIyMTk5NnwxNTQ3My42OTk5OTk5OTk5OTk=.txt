Observations

All cultures were examined under the microscope. When adherent cells were
observed, images were taken. See mia links below.

Culture  
Observations  
  
8241-WALLE02-Bennets Wallaby P0-1of1  
A few very small clusters of cells in A2, no adherent cell observed in B1, a
few dense clusters of cells seen in B2 (while the majority of the well is
bare).  
  
8243-WALLE04-Bennets Wallaby P0-1of1  
No adherent cells observed in A2 or B1, a few small clusters of adhered cells
in B2.  
  
8533-F_WALLE04-Bennets Wallaby P1-1of1  
A lot of debris in the well. Much lower confluence than 8532, estimated
10-15%.  
  
8532-F_WALLE02-Bennets Wallaby P1-1of1  
There is a lot of debris throughout the culture but cells appear healthy.
Estimated confluence, 50-70% (depending on are of well).
