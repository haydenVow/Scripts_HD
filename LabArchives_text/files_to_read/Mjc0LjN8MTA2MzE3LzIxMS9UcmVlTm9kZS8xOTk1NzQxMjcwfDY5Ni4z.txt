Hoechst staining.  
  

  1. Prepared Hoechst stain by adding 5ul of Hoechst to 245ul media.
  2. Scaffold was left to dry in the bsc overnight and then covered with DMEM/F12 media for approx 4hrs prior to use. Details on zein scaffold preparation can be found here:

  3. Media aspirated from scaffold. 
  4. Add 200ul Hoechst mix + incubated for 10 minutes, protected from light. 15:05-15:15
  5. Washed with 2x with 200ul PBS for 5 minutes. 15:16- 15:21, 15:22-15:27
  6. Image. 

Reagents  
Hoeschst: 1403  
DMEM/F12 Mix: 4216  
PBS: 4216




Images and observations  
High level of background fluorescence from Hoechst stained cell-free samples.
I then looked at an unstained scaffold, which had a very similar appearance
indicating that the scaffold itself is absorbing/admitting the light rather
than being stained.
