Procedure
  
  
Prepare plates

  1. Add 50 uL/well of fresh Growth Medium (CD CHO +10% Knockout serum replacement + 1:100 anti-clumping agent + + 4mM L-glutamine +  100ng/mL each FGF, IGF1 + 10ng/mL PDGF + 1x P/S) to plates (6x plates total, 2 for each culture conditions).
  2. Parafilm plates before closing the lid (sterile-side down, facing wells, as demonstrated in image below) & then parafilm lids and plates together (same fashion as is done for fix and stained plates in fridge) for transport to Garvan 12:00

  




Prepare FACS buffer

  1. Prepare 20mL of FACS buffer (PRF DMEM/F12 + 2% FBS).
    1. 400uL FBS + 19.6mL PRF DMEM/F12
  2. Sterile filter through a 0.2 µm filter.
  3. Store at 4ºC until needed. 11:00




1\. Retrieve cell samples from Andrew ~50K cells from each of the follwoing
cultures:

\- 8639-F_DOLLY12-Sheep P11-1of3  
\- 8640-F_DOLLY12-Sheep P11-2of3  
\- 8641-F_DOLLY12-Sheep P11-3of3

All cultures are grown in the same culture media so when performing the FACS
sort the plates will have the same media but each sample will need to be
switched after filling two plates.

  2. Once cell pellet was generated after being retrieved from the E125 culture flask:
    1. Re-suspended each pellet in 1 mL Growth Medium (can go up to 4 - 5mL if necessary, just keep in mind Hoechst is 100 X so if cell suspension is 5 mL, add 50 uL of Hoechst in the next step, etc.)
    2. Placed the FACS tube cell suspension on ice. 12:27

  




Prepare 1 styrofoam boxes to transfer to the Garvan

1 Box with:

  * Pre-filled (medium) multi-well plates, parafilmed (6 total)
  * An ice pack
  * Hoechst (ddH20) - vial is located in large new fridge in library lab, top shelf of door in 70 mL urine container
  * Extra FACS Buffer
  * Tube containing cells
