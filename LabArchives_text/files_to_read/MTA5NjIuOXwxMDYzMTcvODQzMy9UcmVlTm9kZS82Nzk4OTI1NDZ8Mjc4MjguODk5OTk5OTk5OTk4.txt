This viscosity experiment has been deprioritised.




## Performed by:  




## Aim:

To determine whether low and medium alginate (lab grade) are promising
candidates for utilising in the development of lattice and/or adherent
scaffold strands. We aim to examine the structural integrity the alginate
macroscopically by testing it at various concentrations, with various
concentrations of the crosslinking agent, and by creating various physical
forms such as lattice and moulds.

## Hypothesis:

We hypothesise the medium viscosity alginate crosslinked with a high
concentration of CaCl2 will have promising physical attributes (high stiffness
and structural integrity) that make it ideal for as a scaffold component.
