Aim/Purpose


To identify the best basal media to support CHOMP suspension adaptation


Hypothesis


That CHOMP cells will adapt to suspension in at least one of the commercial
suspension basal media formulations paired with several supplements shown to
support adaptation in previous exps


Technical Gap


We have never tried adapting CHOMP cells to suspension using these commercial
media formulations, nor have we tried supplementing them with glutamax, lipid
supplements, or RGD peptides.


Method/Procedure


D0: Seed cells into T175 flasks for adherent slow adaptation and scale up

Thaw 16 x 1 million F_CHOMP09 vials into 12 x T175 flasks at 7500 cells/cm^2
to grow up >28M (these vials should reach ~80 million cells after 1 week but
we are allowing a big margin for lag time after thaw and possible failure of
the suspension medium feed conditions).

Thaw F_DOLLY12 also to seed control flasks in CD CHO.

D3/4: 50% Medium change with suspension media  

Perform 50% change of each flask into the matching suspension basal media
after 3-4 days (still 10% FBS at this point)

D7: Passage cells into suspension culture in 24x50mL shake culture tubes

Passage F_CHOMP from 9-12x T175 flasks into suspension. 28x50mL shake culture
tubes will be seeded with a total of 28M (1M each) into the following basal
media conditions all containing the "10G" supplement:

Positive control: F_DOLLY12 \+ CD CHO + fresh 10G

Negative Control 75% feed: CHOMP DMEM/F12 + 20% FBS  

Positive control 75% feed: F_DOLLY12 \+ CD CHO + fresh 10G

1\. CHOMP RPMI (200 mL)  

2\. CHOMP CD CHO (200 mL)

3\. CHOMP CDM4 CHO (200 mL)

4\. CHOMP CDM4 Avian (200 mL)

5\. CHOMP Hycell CHO (200 mL)

6\. CHOMP ActiPro (200 mL)

7\. CHOMP CDM4HEK293 (200 mL)

9G supplement: 20% KSR + 1:100 glutamax, lipid supplement 1:1000, 1 g/L
pluronic, 1:100 ACA, 100ng/mL each of FGF, IGF1, PDGF +1x p/s (should be
roughly 240 mL, which is enough for 6 x 200 mL = 1200 mL of growth media)

11G supplement: 20% KSR + 1:100 glutamax, lipid supplement 1:1000, 1 g/L
pluronic, 1:100 ACA, 100ng/mL each of FGF, IGF1, PDGF, RGD 100 ng/mL, and
YIGSR 100 ng/mL +1x p/s (should be roughly 240 mL, which is enough for 6 x 200
mL = 1200 mL of growth media)

OT2 Feed

Perform 75% media changes twice per week by centrifuging cell suspensions at
300xg for 5 minutes, discard the supernatant and re-suspend cells in their
respective growth medias. Take 100 uL of resuspended sample for imaging and
cell counts.  ENSURE THAT OT TIP ASPIRATE HEIGHT IS APPRECIABLY ABOVE PELLET,
IDEALLY >> 5 mm  

OT2 Cell counts

Transfer 100 uL sample to a 96 well-plate. Add 100 uL of stain buffer (Hoechst
33342 Readyflow) to the cells and incubate at room temperature and in the dark
for 30 minutes. Prepare serial dilutions (50%, 25%, 12.5%) of the stained cell
preparation in subsequent wells, diluting with dPBS. Image all wells using the
Zaber and analyse using MIA.

Shaking speeds:

Recommendation for 50 mL tubes is 180-250 RPM with a 50 mm orbital diameter:
https://www.tpp.ch/page/downloads/bioreactor/Recommendations-11-2014.pdf?m=1557880784&

No agitation at all will occur at 100 RPM or below with a 50 mm orbital
diameter:
https://www.tpp.ch/page/downloads/bioreactor/MixingTime_50mLTPP_Entfaerbung.pdf?m=1557880815&

Smaller orbital diameters require a higher shaking speed as the mixing power
is related to the square of the velocity of the well
