Experiment Plan:




### Prodecure: Harvesting - TrypLE-EDTA Method

  1. Discard media from the roller bottle.
  2. Rinse twice with 50mL warmed dPBS, then discard.
  3. Dispense 20mL TrypLE and place bottle in the incubator , set at a speed of 0.5rpm (recommended guidelines 0.3-0.5 rpm)
  4. After 18 minutes of incubation, remove the flask from the incubator and observe under the microscope for complete dissociation.
  5. Pour solution out into a centrifuge tube at a 45 degree angle.
  6. Rinse with 20mL dPBS twice ensuring entire surface has been covered. Note: You may use a serological pipette for this. Alternatively place the bottle on the roller apparatus for 2 minutes.
  7. Spin centrifuge tubes at 600 x g for 5 minutes (if using 50mL tubes), or 1000 x g for 5 minutes (if using 250mL tubes)
  8. Aspirate supernatant and combine into a resuspension pellet. Cells are now harvested.

  

### Procedure: Harvesting - Cell Scraping Method

NOTE: cell scraping will lyse cells.

  1. Discard media from the roller bottle.

  2. Using a cell scraper, scrape the sides of the roller bottle to remove cells.

Note: NUNC PETG roller bottles may be cut using a razor-type utility knife or
a hot knife to comfortable access the surface area of the roller bottle.

Cells are now harvested.




Aggregate has formed on 19/08/21 but was left in the roller bottle until the
following day for harvest (20/08/21). The following day for harvest the
aggregate looked more rolled up and smaller than the previous day. The roller
bottle was checked for any adhered cells and there was very minimal still
adhered. For harvest the free floating aggregate was pipetted into a pre-
weighed falcon tube and pulse spun to remove all supernatant and excess media
before weighing again. Pellet was then stored in the freezer.
