RELATED TO MILESTONE:  

Q3 Clones KR2: Derive 1500 clones from at least 7500 cells per month starting
September 1st.

AIM/PURPOSE:

To determine whether gelatin coating wells or adding FGF basic to our media
will impact F_DOLLY12 cell survival and growth after single cell sorting.

HYPOTHESIS:

We hypothesis that exposure of cells to gelatin coated wells and FGF
containing media will produce the highest percentage of surviving clones after
14 days

RESULTS SUMMARY:

A higher number of clones were picked from wells which had been treated with
gelatin and/or FGFb compared to wells that did not contain either of these.
However, this is based on cell counts from the machine learning model which
was inaccurate for fibroblasts in 384 wp.

CONCLUSIONS:

The hypothesis could not be confirmed in this experiment because the machine
learning model used for counting cells was inaccurate. Additionally, cell
viability was likely affected by staining cells with Hoechst ReadyFlow
reagent. No immortalised cell lines were created.

NEXT STEPS:

The effect of gelatin and FGF on fibroblast single cell cloning will need to
be investigated again after a better ML model has been developed.

Collect more data for ML model by imaging Hoechst stained cells on phase on
DAPI channel (EPIC25398).

Investigate the effect of Hoechst staining on cell viability (EPIC24301).

Set up a suspension cloning pipeline.
