  

  1. Using a sterile tweezer, remove sample from the well into a fresh plate containing pre-warmed media.  (only doing for 1M cells)
  2. Aspirated media from  250 ul    wells of each treatment and pipetted into   6   x 70 mL pots   

  3. Added 100ul of PBS to each well in the now empty cell-laden 96-well plate (wash step)
  4. Removed PBS from all wells and pipetted into same tube containing media (so any washed away cells from this step will still be included in the count)  

  5. Added 50ul of Tryple to each well.
  6. Placed plate in the incubator for 10 min until cells lifted. Time stamp:    16:16 pm        

  7. Removed tryple from wells and added to tubes containing media and PBS. 
    1. NOTE: If there are still a number of cells adhered to the base of the wells, add another 50 uL of tryple and replaced in incubator.
    2. Removed tryple and added to tubes containing media, tryple and PBS.
  8. Took 1 x 10 uL sample from each 8 x cell suspensions and added    30 uL   trypan blue 
  9. Loaded onto Haemocytometer and performed cell counts. (Subtract the cell count from initial seed density of this condition and divide by number of wells.)

  1. Cell count ( 1    M,  ACF Autoclave sample   ): cell count: 3,447,360
    * Efficiency: ((initial seeding density - cells left in plate)/ initial seeding density)*100 =     13.816     %
  2. Cell count (  1   M,   ACF HT + Autoclave sample   ): cell count: 3,441,000
    * Efficiency: ((initial seeding density - cells left in plate)/ initial seeding density)*100 =     13.975     %
  3. Cell count (  1   M,   ACF HT + Autoclave \+ EPL sample    ):cell count:  3,737,520
    * Efficiency: ((initial seeding density - cells left in plate)/ initial seeding density)*100 =     6.562     %
  4. Cell count ( 1    M,   Serum Autoclave sample    ): cell count: 2,420,800
    * Efficiency: ((initial seeding density - cells left in plate)/ initial seeding density)*100 =    39.48      %
  5. Cell count (  1   M,  Serum  HT + Autoclave sample    ): cell count: 3,544,200
    * Efficiency: ((initial seeding density - cells left in plate)/ initial seeding density)*100 =    11.395      %
  6. Cell count (  1   M,  Serum  HT + Autoclave \+ EPL sample    ): cell count: 3,021,520
    * Efficiency: ((initial seeding density - cells left in plate)/ initial seeding density)*100 =    24.462      %
