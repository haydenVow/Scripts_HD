Prepare materials for thaw and seed:

  *  Growth media (for seeding):    150mL  OPTI media, 30mL KSR media  

  * Time that aliquot was placed in the water bath to warm before use:  15:10 (OptiPro), 17:40 (KSR)  

  




## Thaw and seed vial:

3\. Collected the cryovial from Liquid Nitrogen storage & place in foam
floater in water bath for 3 min

Vial details

KHAKIO- 1 vial, 2M cells, 14809,MAGGIE,TOWER 1, BOX 4, POSITION 1  
DUCKEYE- 1 vial, 2M cells, 14908, HOMER, TOWER 3, BOX 6, POSITION C6

MUSCO- 1 vial, 5M cells,14847, HOMER, TOWER 3, BOX 4, POSITION I8  

`4. Ethanol sprayed & transferred the vial(s) to the BSC.`

`5.  Added  500µL of Growth Media (to generate a total volume of 1mL in the
cryovial) to the cryovial, resuspended the cell suspension gently to reduce
osmotic shock. `

`6. Collected the entire 1mL of cell suspension & transfer into the pre-warmed
tube of Growth Media. `

`7. Using a 10mL serological pipette, resuspended & distributed the cells
evenly in the pre-warmed Growth Media (30mL per flask) (prepared in Step 2).`

`8. Transverred into`` T175 flasks, 1 flask for KHAKIO, DUCKEYE and MUSCK, 3x
flasks for MUSCO```

`9. Transfered flask/plate(s) to incubate at: `

  * [ x ]  37ºC, 5% CO2, Incubator #77 Library lab.
