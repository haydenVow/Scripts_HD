Process:

  
E-125 flasks

  1. Collected E125s from shaker, wiped with ethanol-sprayed Rediwipe, and brought into BSC
  2. Using a 25 mL serelogical pipette, gently pipette-mixed culture for 1 minute to break up cell clumps
  3. Pipette suspension though 70 um cell strainer into 3 x 50 mL tubes. Kept E125 vessels in BSC, as culture will be returned to this vessel after feed. 
  4. Centrifuged 50 mL tubes at 300 x g for 5 min.   14:35 - 14:40   

  5. Aspirated  10 % ( 25 mL) of supernatant, leaving ~100-200 uL on the pellet
  6. Measured how much growth media was left on pellet and recorded
  7. Took 10 uL from each cell supsension for cell counts
  8.

6-Well-Plates

  1. Collected 6-well-plates from shaker, wiped with ethanol-sprayed Rediwipe, and brought into BSC   14:10     

  2. Using a 5 mL serelogial, transferred each cell suspension into 6 x 15 mL tubes. Kept 6-well-plates in BSC, as culture will be returned to vessel after feed. 
  3. Centrifuged 15 mL tubes at 300 x g for 5 min.   14:21 - 14:26   

  4. Aspirated   ~100 % of supernatant, taking extra care to not disrupt or aspirate pellet 
  5. Resuspended and measured residual volume
  6. Took 20 uL sample, performed manual cell count
  7. Added  3 mL  of fresh, warmed growth media
  8. Gently pipette-mixed culture using 5 mL serelogical or P1000, before moving cell suspension back to 6-well-plate
  9. Took 100 uL samples from each culture and stored in separate microtubes until ready to stain alongside 50 mL shake tubes. 
  10. Returned 6-well-plates to incubator.   : 

Incubator (#81), Lab [Main/Library/Production]

  

1\. Dilute 100 uL samples with trypan blue staining dye and add 10 uL of each
condition onto a haemocytometer slide and perform a manual count to check if
any cells are still present and if so are still viable to kept in continuous
culture.

  

Only perform the remainder of the procedure if there are viable cells visible
on the haemocytometer with trypan staining.

  1. Aliquoted growth media as indicated in the growth media section:
    * Placed in water bath    

  2. Prepared stain buffer in 15 mL tube by combining the following (1 drop of each stain solution per 1 mL of dPBS):
    * __ mL of dPBS 
    * __ drops of NucBlue Live Cell Stain ReadyProbes Hoechst 33342
    * __ drops of NucGreen Dead 488 Cell Stain ReadyProbes Sytox Green
      * Vortexted mix for ~5 seconds, then stored in dark until ready to use.

### Observations/Summary:

All cultures show no signs of viable cell life - just lots of debris and some
clumped dead cells. Discarded all cultures.
