Process:

1\. Aliquotted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then
placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath for a minimum of 20 minutes
prior to use:

  1.  TrypLE:  4.2L  
  2.  dPBS (for washing and neutralising)  8.4
  3.  Growth media (for pellet resuspension):   500mL
  4.  Time that all aliquots were placed in the water bath to warm before use:  9:50

Note: if aliquots were placed in water bath at different times, record the
time stamp for each individual solution.




1\. Imaged the 4CF  
  
2\. Removed spent media

3\. Added 500(10CF)/200(4CF)mL tryple to each vessel/well and incubated at
37ºC for 10 min

Start/Finish time for TrypLE was:  
12:48  
12:55  
12:58  
13:02  
13:04  

4\. Neutralised with 500 (10CF)/200(4CF) dPBS (warmed) and combined cell
suspension into |250mL| tubes.

5\. Centrifuged at 650 x g for 5 min

Start/Finish time for centrifugation was  
13:10  
13:12  
13:17  
13:18  
13:25  
13:27  
13:32  
13:34  
13:39  
13:41




6\. Aspirated the supernatant(s).

7\. Resuspend pellet(s) in |500|mL Growth media (combined).

8\. Performed a cell count using the haemocytometer and recorded the cell
count data in the Google Doc spreadsheet called 'Cell Count Spreadsheet' (see
link below):

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1DPzKubYxfHmWogVPihC-
SSIBtIylyrBQE5kRX5Z8NtI/edit#gid=0

9\. Total cell number was: | 2,225,000,000 |

10\. Calculate the required volume cell suspension & freeze medium to generate
a concentration of (10M) cells/mL. = 222.5mL




13\. Aspirated supernatant carefully, taking care not to disturb the pellet.

14\. Resuspended the pellet in | 222.5 |mL freeze media (chilled, to reduce
DMSO toxicity).

15\. Aliquotted | 1mL (10M cells) or 1.5mL (15M cells)|into 25 vials @10M/vial
and 125 vials @15M/vial

16\. Tightened the lids & transfer the cryovials to a Mr. Frosty immediately
into the -80ºC freezer.  Last frosty put in freezer @ 16:10

17\. Allow the cells to freeze for at least 18-24 hours before transferring to
Liquid Nitrogen storage.
