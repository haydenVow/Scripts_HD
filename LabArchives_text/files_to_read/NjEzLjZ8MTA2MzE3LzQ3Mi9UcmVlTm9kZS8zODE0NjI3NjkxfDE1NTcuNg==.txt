### Process:

1\. Took image of vessel with microscope on phase setting.

2\. Gelatin coated    1      x    2CF      vessel    with sterile filtered
0.1% gelatin solution and then incubated all coated flasks at 37˚C.

  1. Time when all vessels(s) placed into the incubator     15:00 

3\. Aliquotted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then
placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath for a minimum of 20 minutes
prior to use:

  1. TrypLE:     30    mL in     1x 50 mL    tube
  2.  dPBS (At 37 degrees for washing):     30    mL in    1x 50 mL    tube
  3.  dPBS (at RT neutralising):     30    mL in    1x 50 mL    tube
  4. Growth media (for pellet resuspension):     5    mL in     15 mL    tubes
  5. Growth media (for seeding):     300    mL in   pre-aliquoted media container 

Time that all aliquots were placed in the water bath the warm before use
15:17

Note: if aliquots were placed in water bath at different time, record the time
stamp for each individual solution.




4\. Removed vessel(s) from the incubator  15:30

5\. Washed the vessel(s) with dPBS (warmed).

6\. Added     10    mL tryple to each vessel/well and incubated at 37˚C.

  1. Start/Finish for TrypLE was  15:35 - 15:45 

7\. Neutralised with     10 mL    dPBS and combined cell suspension into a
2x 50 mL    tubes.

8\. Centrifuged at 650 x g for 5 min.

  1. Start/Finish time for centrifugation was  15:53  \- 15:58  




9\. Aspirated the supernatant(s).

10\. Resuspended pellet(s) in     5    mL     Growth     media  16:08  

11\. Aliquoted     10 uL     of resuspended cells into a microcentrifuge tube
for cell count.

12\. Performed a cell count using the haemocytometer and recorded the cell
count data in the Google Doc spreadsheet called 'Cell Count Spreadsheet' (see
link below):

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1DPzKubYxfHmWogVPihC-
SSIBtIylyrBQE5kRX5Z8NtI/edit#gid=0

  1.  Total cell number was:       3,728,000      

  2. Volume of cell suspension required for subculture was:      2.14592       

  3. Cell density per vessel:     2M cells into 1 x 2CF  (ie 1582 cell per cm2)   any excess give to Chris (~1.7M)  




13\. Transferred   2145 µl of cell suspension to the pre-warmed   300 mL
Growth media:   16:38

14\. Transferred cell suspension into the pre-gelatin coated   1x 2CF vessel.

15\. Left at RT in the BSC for 30 min to allow cells to settle   16:45  \-
17:15  

16\. Transferred vessel(s) to incubate at:

  * [x]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells) thermo incubator
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (avian cells)
