Process:

  1. Checked both plates under microscope to ensure cells are in wells. Noted if cells were present and healthy in the "Observation" section below. We've had cell death recently - so would appreciate a quick look :)
  2. Placed previously aliquotted media in water bath  10:12 am 
  3. Removed  100  % of supernatant from vessel. 
  4. Replaced with  140uL  (per well/per vessel) of  E6   media. 
  5. Returned vessel to incubate at: 11:33AM

  * [X]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (aviary cells)

  

  * Incubator (Sanyo), Lab [Main]
