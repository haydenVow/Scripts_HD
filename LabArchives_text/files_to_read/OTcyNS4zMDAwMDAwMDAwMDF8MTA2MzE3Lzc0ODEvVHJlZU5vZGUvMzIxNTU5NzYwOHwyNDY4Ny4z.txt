### Process:

1\. Took image of vessel with microscope on phase setting.

3\. Aliquotted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then
placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath for a minimum of 20 minutes
prior to use:

  1. TrypLE:     4x5    mL in     1x50mL    tubes
  2.  dPBS (for neutralising):     4x5    mL
  3.  dPBS (for washing):    4x5     mL
  4. PBS (for pellet resuspension):     5    mL
  5. Growth media (for seeding):     4x30    mL 

Growth media was aliquoted into T175 flasks (30mL per flack) and flasks were
placed in the incubator to warm at 30 degrees, 5% CO2     10:00   a/pm

Note: if aliquots were placed in water bath at different time, record the time
stamp for each individual solution.




4\. Removed vessel(s) from the incubator and removed supernatant from each
flask.

5\. Washed the vessel(s) with dPBS (warmed).

6\. Added     5    mL tryple to each vessel/well and incubated at 30ËšC for 8
minutes.

7\. Collected supernatants for each flask in separate tubes then washed empty
flasks with     5     dPBS and combined the wash with the respective cell
suspensions in 50mL tubes.

8\. Centrifuged at  400x g for 5 min.




9\. Aspirated the supernatant(s).

10\. Resuspended pellet(s) in    1     mL     dPBS  

11\. Aliquoted      10uL    of resuspended cells into a microcentrifuge tube
for cell count.

12\. Performed a cell count using the haemocytometer and recorded the cell
count data in the Google Doc spreadsheet: Cell Count Spreadsheet or cell count
widget below

13\. Transferred      200uL      of cell suspension to separate tube 1.5mL
tubes for future RNA extraction, tubes were spun at 400g for 5 minutes and
supernatant was removed before cells were placed at -80 degrees, top shelf of
the library lab -80 freezer.

 13.5 The remaining cells were plated into T flasks, T75 for LARS in 12mL of
growth media, and T175 flasks for the remaining three groups in 30mL of media.

16\. Transferred flasks to incubate at 30 degrees, 5% Co2 in incubator 140 in
library lab.

Version Change Log

NameChange Details  
V1 (original)N/A  
V2Changed all sentences to past tense to better reflect a hand-written lab
book entry.  
Various formatting changes.  
Addition of more detail to step 2, removal of step 3. Replaced volume
requirements table with updated volumes @Sep 22, 2020  
Updated temperature selection for mammalian/aviary cells @Sep 23, 2020  
V3Included a section for 'vessel type' in passage ID table Replace
'flask/plate' with 'vessel' throughout lab book Include at step 1 to take
image of vessel on the microscope  
Mentioned that dPBS for washing should be warm - step 3(2) and 5.  
Added timepoint at step 4 for when vessel is removed from incubator  
Include at step 11 to aliquot cell resuspension into microcentrifuge tube  
Included at step 10 and 13 time point for when cell pellet is resuspended and
when resuspended cells is moved into growth media.  
Included p38i in table of regent used  
Combined two dPBS entries in 'Media/reagents' table Added 'cell density per
vessel'
