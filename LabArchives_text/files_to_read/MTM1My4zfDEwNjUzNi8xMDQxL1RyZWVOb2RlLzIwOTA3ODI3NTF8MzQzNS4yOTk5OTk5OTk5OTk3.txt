Notable Events:

  * Due to the widespread fungal contamination across the labs and the high possibility that this infection originated for the WCB bank used to see this batch, it was decided to terminated this culture despite not observing any spindle structures in the flasks. This fungal infection was found to be very slow growing and so it was likely that the infection was in these flasks but not yet detectable. Due to their small size from being at the very beginning of the process this was not considered a great loss to be on the side of caution.
