### Process:

1\. Took image of vessel with microscope on phase setting.

3\. Aliquotted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then
placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath for a minimum of 20 minutes
prior to use:

  1. TrypLE:    200     mL in   1      tubes
  2.  dPBS (for neutralising):     200    mL
  3.  dPBS (for washing):      200   mL
  4. Growth media (for pellet resuspension & seeding):    3000    mL 

Time that all aliquots were placed in the water bath the warm before use
15:13 pm  

Note: if aliquots were placed in water bath at different time, record the time
stamp for each individual solution.




4\. Removed vessel from the incubator

5\. Washed the vessel(s) with dPBS (warmed).

6\. Added    200     mL tryple to each vessel/well and incubated at 37˚C.

  1. Start/Finish for TrypLE was    16:13 pm 

7\. Neutralised with     200     dPBS and combined cell suspension into a    8
x 50mL    tubes.

8\. Centrifuged at 650 x g for 5 min.

  1. Start/Finish time for centrifugation was   16:40 pm 




9\. Aspirated the supernatant(s).

10\. Resuspended pellet(s) in     100    mL     Growth     media

11\. Aliquoted       10uL x 2   of resuspended cells into a microcentrifuge
tube for cell count.

12\. Performed a cell count using the haemocytometer and recorded the cell
count data in the Google Doc spreadsheet: Cell Count Spreadsheet or cell count
widget below

  1. Total cell number was:      144M cells       

  2. Volume of cell suspension required for subculture was:      all       

  3. Cell density per vessel:      50M/10F      




13\. PERFORMED 3 TIMES: Transferred      33.3     ml of cell suspension to the
pre-warmed      1.5     L Growth media:      17:39 pm

14\. Transferred each batch of cells in 1.5L of media into 1 x 10CF.

15\. Placed all 3 x 10CF flasks to incubate at:  16:50 pm  

  * [X ]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells) in the library lab
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (avian cells)




Observations/Summary:

144M F_KUZCO20 cells harvested from 1 x 4CF and seeded into 3 x 10CFs.
