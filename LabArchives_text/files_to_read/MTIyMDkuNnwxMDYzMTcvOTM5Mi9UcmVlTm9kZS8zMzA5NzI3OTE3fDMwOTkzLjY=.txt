Briefly

  1. Culture media was removed from each clone that appeared >90% Confluent (see wells A1 and A3 of culture 13137 on Ranger) 
  2. 1mL of dpBS was added to wash the cells 
  3. dPBS was removed and cells were then treated with 1mL of TRYPLE-EDTA
  4. Cells were incubated at 30 degrees for 10 minutes to detach cells
  5. Cells were removed from incubation, mixed by pipetting. then all of the Tryple volume was taken from each clone and added to individual 15mL tubes.
  6. Wells were washed with 2mL of dPBS. 
  7. DPBS washes were collected into their respective tubes containing clones in Tryple-EDTA. 
  8. Cells were centrifuged at 650g for 5 minutes. 
  9. Supernatant was removed and cells were resuspended in 5mL of DMEM/F12 + 20% FBS + 1xP/S growth media. 
  10. Cells were transferred to their own T25 flasks. 
  11. Flasks were returned to incubate at 30 degrees, 5% CO2. (flask ID's 13227 for clone B/B1 and 13228 for clone C/E6.
