Inspected the 3xT175 flasks containing the DAISY4_16G9 clones. All cells
appeared to be less triangular in morphology than what we would expect our
muscle stem cells to look like. They instead still retain a spiked and/or flat
egg morphology. Images of each of the 3xT175 flasks were captured in MIA
capture under 5x objective on the Primovert microscope. The quality of the
images was not ideal, there appears to be a bright spot in the corner of each
image that could not be corrected. The issue was raised with engineering.
