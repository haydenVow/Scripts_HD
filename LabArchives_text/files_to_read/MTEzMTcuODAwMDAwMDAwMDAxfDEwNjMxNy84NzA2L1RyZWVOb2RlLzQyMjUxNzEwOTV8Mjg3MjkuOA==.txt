Experimental Plan


Background

The previous experiments demonstrated two limitations, premature collapse of
gel scaffolds and cell escaping from scaffold proliferating faster in media.

Aim

1\. To invesitgate the cause of gel scaffold collapse by seeding pork bun gels
with a no cell control, while also include a pork bun gel formulation with a
medium MW alginate, as increases in MW of algiante has been shown to increase
scaffold stability.

2\. Investigate whether transistioning cells to adherent form as opposed to
suspension will increase cell proliferation in the gel scaffold.

Hypothesis

With an increase in MW of alginate, the scaffolds should stay intact for the
duration of culture (1 week), in addition the adherent cultures will
proliferate faster in the gel scaffold compared to the suspension cultures.


Experimental Layout


  

BRIEF OVERVIEW

1\. Pork bun gels created and left overnight in the refrigerator to hydrate
prior to autoclaving 20 mins at 121C on liquid setting.

2\. Gels mixed with cells and cast into shapes.

3\. Cultured in cell strainers for 7 days with daily 50% feeds. With viability
stain performed at day 1, 4 and 7 and if possible a metabolic assay on those
days as well.
