1\. Prepared   50 mL  PBST (0.2% Triton-X)

2\. Prepared   15 mL  blocking buffer: PBST (0.1% Triton-X + PBS) + 3% bovine
serum albumin (BSA). (Kept in the fridge until needed in blocking step)

3\. Prepared Primary Antibody Mix: :  40 µL   Primary #1 MyoG (Santa Cruz)
(1:200  ) +  160 µL   Primary #2 MF20 (DSHB)   (1:50  ) +   8 mL Blocking
Buffer (enough for 20 samples in 96 wp, stained with 100 uL antibody mix)

Pipette-mixed antibody mix and stored refrigerated away from light until
needed.

Process:

Fixing ( ~ 1.20 - 2.30 hr)

  1.  Prepare 0.1% PFA - 0.6mL of 4%PFA in 24mL of PBS   

  2. Removed media from each well and wash with PBS.   

  3.  Added  500 uL µL PFA for 1 - 2 hours  (1hr for small loops, 2hrs if the loop is >5mm in diameter) :  10:53 - 12:11 pm 
  4. Removed PFA (and add in PFA waste container) and wash wells 3 times with   500 µL of ice cold PBS

PBS wash

1: 12:11 - 12:16

2: 12:18 - 12:23

3:  12:25 - 12:30

  

  

Permeabilise ( ~ 20 - 30 min)

1\. Removed PBS from each well.

2\. Added  500 µL PBST (0.2% Triton-X) to each well for 15 min:  12:33 - 12:48
pm

3\. Aspirated PBST for each well.




Blocking ( ~ 1 hr)

1\. Added  500 µL of blocking buffer (3% BSA in PBST [0.1% Triton-X]) and
incubate for 45 minutes - 1hr at RT. (no more than 1 hour):   12:51 - 1:51 pm




Single/Simultaneous Primary Antibody staining ( ~ 10 minutes or 2hr)

1\. Removed blocking buffer from each well.

2\. Incubated cells with 400uL primary antibody for 2hrs at RT, or 4ºC
overnight:   14:03 - 16:03 pm

After this step, all further task should be performed in a dark room. The
vessel should also be wrapped foil when not used.




Observations/Summary:

### \- for the conical insert, collagen samples formed a tight ring around the
center
