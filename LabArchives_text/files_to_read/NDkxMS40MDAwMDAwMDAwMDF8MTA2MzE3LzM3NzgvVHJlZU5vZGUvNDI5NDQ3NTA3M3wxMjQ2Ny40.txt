###  




1\. Prepare growth media for each condition.  

2\. Transferred the required volume of each reagent in the table above to each
vessel and then placed vessels in incubator for a minimum of 20 minutes prior
to use:

  * Growth media (for seeding) 50 mL bioreactor spin tubes:   8 mL  (2x replicates for each condition in map - 8 in total) 
  * Growth media 2% FBS:    8 mL   for cell resuspension  

  * Growth media 2% FBS:    10 mL    for neutralising   

  * Time that aliquot was placed in the incubator to warm before use:   14:33      

  




## Thaw and seed vials:

Amount of cells required =  8,000,000 cells (to seed cells at 200,000
cells/mL):

\- 8x 50 mL bioreactor spin tubes (5 mL media in each tube) at 1,000,000 cells
per tube =  8,000,000 cells

  

1\. Collected the cryovials from LN storage & place in foam floater in water
bath for 5 min      14:53  \- 14:57  

Vial details:  4   x  DOLLY12 Fibroblast  cryovials at  1M/5M  cells each for
a total of   8M  cells

`2. Ethanol sprayed & transferred the vial(s) to the BSC.`

3\. Added     500 uL   of growth media (media prepared for neutralising) to
generate a total volume of 1 mL in each of the cryovials, resuspending the
cell suspension gently to reduce osmotic shock.

4\. Transfer entire cell suspensions into the remainder of the aliquot of
neutralising medium

5\. Centrifuge the cells at 300 x g for 5 min at RT:     15:00   \-   15:05  

6\. Removed supernatant to remove residual DMSO from cells. Note be extra
careful not to aspirate any cells  

7\. Resuspended the pellet in the    8  mL  of growth media prepared for
seeding the cells.

8\. Transfer   1000 uL of the cell suspension into each of the pre warmed
growth media conditions (to seed cells at 200,000 cells/mL - 8 conditions
total). Gently resuspended and distribute the cells evenly in 4 mL of pre-
warmed growth media using a p1000.

9\. Transferred flask/plates(s) to incubate at: ` 15:13  
`

  * [x]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (aviary cells)

10\. 50 mL bioreactor spin tubes were shaken at 206 RPM to achieve  P/V ~60
W/m3 as per the power/kLa calculator:

Making labels

Note - You will need to increase the passage number by one. (i.e. if your
thawed vial ID has a passage number of 3, when you make a culture ID for you
vessel you will need change the passage number to 4 on Airtable.)
