Plating of and EPL coating of zein samples to be used for Hoechst survival
experiment

1\. Zein pieces (covered in DMEM/F12 and stored in petri dishes on 13/04/21)
were removed from the biomaterials fridge.

2\. N= 16 samples were transferred to untreated 96 well plates as follows  
N=4 samples to be seeded with cells and subsequently stained with Hoechst at
D1, + N=4 samples to be seeded with cells but not stained with Hoechst at D1,
N= 4 samples for cell free controls, to be stained with Hoechst at D1,  N= 4
samples for cell free controls not to be stained with Hoechst at D1  

3\. Approx. 180ul of 2.5% EPL coating solution was added to each scaffold
containing well.

4\. Plates were then sealed with parafilm and returned to the biomaterials
fridge overnight.

1\. The Zein pieces in 96 well plates (stored in the biomaterials fridge on
14/04/21) were transferred from the fridge to the BSC.

2\. All EPL solution was removed from the wells.

3\. The zein pieces were left to dry with the plate lids ajar in the BSC.

Since the samples were not drying fast enough, the lids were completely
removed from the plates. 13:00
