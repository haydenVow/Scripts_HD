D5 Diff samples- Fix, MyoD, TE7, DAPI stain and Image 2 samples from each
condition, Note down whether there is a good cell coverage across the
material/scaffold surface.

Process:

1\. Removed plate culture IDs: 6496-DOLLY12-Sheep P11-1of1  containing
scaffolds from the incubator.

2\. Used sterile tweezers to carefully transfer   10x (highlighted in bold in
the image above)   scaffold pieces to separate wells on a 24 well plate.

3\. Washed the pieces in the 96-well plate 3x in   200 uL of PBS for  5
minutes at room temperature.

  1. 10:45 - 10:50   

  2. 10:54 - 10:59   

  3. 11:00 - 11:05   

  




4\. Added 150 uL of 4% PFA to each scaffold and incubate for  15  min at room
temperature.  11:13 - 11:28  




5. Wash the pieces 3 times for   5    minutes in   200  uL of PBS.

  1. 11:30 - 11:35   

  2. 11:38 - 11:43   

  3. 11:44 - 11:49   

  

6\. Aspirate the PBS and leave the scaffold pieces just covered by fresh PBS.

7\. Proceed with primary antibody staining.
