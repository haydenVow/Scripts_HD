1\. Made up new 50uL primer working stocks for P27 and P28 (ZIC1-guide 2) by
adding 5uL of each primer stock to 45 uL of miliQ water.

  1. Took samples to the PCR machine and set the settings to (melting temp for primers used was 61 degress C).  

  2. To visualize PCR products, made up a 1 % agarose gel in 0.5X TBE buffer (1 tablet + 50mL of 0.5X TBE). 
    * The following tutorial was followed for setting up the gel electrophoresis station on the BentoLab https://bento.bio/protocol/biotechnology-101/introduction-to-gel-electrophoresis/
  3. Add GelGreen® at a volume of 1 μl per 10 mL of agarose, as shown in the table below. Swirl container to mix, taking care to avoid any bubbles.
  4. Ran the PCR products on the gel using 2uL of loading dye mixed with 5uL of PCR product. Loading order listed below
