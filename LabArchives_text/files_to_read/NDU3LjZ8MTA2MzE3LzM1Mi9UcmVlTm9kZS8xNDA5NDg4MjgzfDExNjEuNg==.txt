Preparation of zein (3SP)

Volumes of zein needed for different plate formats:

6-well plate - 1 scaffold = 1ml

24-well plate - 1 scaffold = 300 ul (pipetted onto 2 ml of water)

96-well plate - 1 scaffold = 50ul

  

  1. Determine the following key volumes and weights to make the desired number of scaffold pieces:
    1. Number of scaffold pieces desired: 24 wells x 1 plate = 24 scaffolds 
    2. Volume of zein solution used per scaffold piece: 500 uL per piece, ~ 12 mL sol'n per 24WP 
    3. Total volume of zein solution (number of scaffold pieces x volume/piece) + loss/error: 5*3 + error = 18 mL total sol'n
    4. Total grams of zein required (total volume of zein solution / 5): 18/5 = 3.6 g zein powder
    5. Total volume of 80% ethanol to make (total volume of zein solution + loss/error to the filter): 18 + 2 = 20 mL 80% ethanol
  2. Acquire aliquot volumes of the Ultrapure water (sterile filter milliQ water using a 0.2 um filter into a sterile tube in the BSC) and of 100% ethanol 65 + 4 + error = 80 mL of Ultrapure water needed
  3. Weigh out 3.6 g of zein powder into a sterile sample pot and record the actual weight below:
    1. Actual zein weight: 3.6055 g
  4. Transfer the zein powder, 100% ethanol and Ultrapure water into the BSC in the Production lab
  5. Make 20 mL of 80% ethanol in the BSC and filter it using a 0.2 um filter
    1. Volume made: ~18.3 mL
  6. Add 18 mL of 80% ethanol into a sterile sample pot/container and add a sterile magnetic stirrer bar (previously spray with ethanol then autoclave in a autoclave bag) inside the BSC
  7. Commence mixing of the 80% ethanol on the stirrer (sprayed down and brought into the BSC) and slowly add the pre-weighed 3.6055 g zein powder until it is all added
  8. Mix at room temperature until the powder has completely solubilised (20-60 minutes):
    1. Start time: 14:30 
    2. Finish time: 15:20
  9. Add 200 uL of 0.2 um filtered ultrapure water to each well of a 96-well plates (use multichannel pipette) 
    1. Number of 96-well plates required: 3 plates 
    2. Total vol. filtered ultrapure water required = 57.6 mL + error = 65 mL 
  10. After solubilisation, carefully add 50 uL of the zein solution to the top surface of the ultrapure water in each well in the 96-well plate (drop by drop) so that a skin forms on the surface of the water (use multichannel) 
  11. Allow the zein to form in each plate inside the BSC with the lids completely removed for 60-90 minutes
    1. Start time (last plate): 15:37 (checked at 16:20, 16:30, and 16:36)
    2. Finish time: (started removing first pieces) 16:40
  12. Using a sterile spatula and forceps, loosen the edges of each zein piece from the walls of the wells and transfer the zein pieces into a sterile sample pot/container/tissue culture dish with 20 mL of DMEM. Discard any damaged or cracked pieces
    1. Number of pieces discarded due to damage or dropping: 5
    2. Number of pieces available for use: 283 (however a fair number of them are irregular shapes or may not be ideal for seeding) 
  13. Seal the container and store the scaffold pieces at 4C overnight or until needed, for a maximum of 7 days prior to use.

## Finish time: 18:30

# Deviations/Observations

  1. No autoclaved stir bars available so had to autoclave more (cycle ran from 14:04 - 14:19)
  2. Zein was quite stretchy at the beginning, and it took us a while to finesse our technique. We determined that the best method was to ensure the zein was entirely separated from the edge of the wells before attempting to lift it out, otherwise the elasticity of the samples meant that you would get a stretched piece with long tendrils on the edges. 
  3. It took a while to get through all the plates, so by the time we were working on the last samples they had become more brittle and easier to break into pieces. A few had also formed small holes in the centre of the samples.

Note - Zein is in a medium sized sigma-aldrich tub on the shelving above the
biomaterials section/heated stir plates in the main lab.
