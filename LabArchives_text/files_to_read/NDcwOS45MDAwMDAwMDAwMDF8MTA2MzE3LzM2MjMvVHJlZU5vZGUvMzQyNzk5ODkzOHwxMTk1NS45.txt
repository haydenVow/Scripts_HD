Process:

 1\. Aliquotted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and
then placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath for a minimum of 20 minutes
prior to use:

  1.  TrypLE:  41 mL in | 1 | tubes
  2.  dPBS (for washing and neutralising)   82 mL in | 1 | tubes 
  3.  Growth media (for pellet resuspension):   10.5 mL in | 1 | tubes 
  4.  Time that all aliquots were placed in the water bath to warm before use:   9 :43  

Note: if aliquots were placed in water bath at different times, record the
time stamp for each individual solution.




2\. Washed the flask(s) with dPBS.

3\. Added | 10 |mL tryple to each vessel/well and incubated at 37ºC for | 15 |
min

  1.  | 10:06 - 10:21 | 

4\. Neutralised with | 10mL/vessel | dPBS (warmed) and combined cell
suspension into |2x 50 ml  | tubes.

5\. Centrifuged at 650 x g for 5 min

  1.  Start/Finish time for centrifugation was:   10:30 - 10:35    




6\. Aspirated the supernatant(s).

7\. Resuspend pellet(s) in | 10 |mL | growth | media.

8\. Performed a cell count using the haemocytometer and recorded the cell
count data in the Google Doc spreadsheet called 'Cell Count Spreadsheet' (see
link below):

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1DPzKubYxfHmWogVPihC-
SSIBtIylyrBQE5kRX5Z8NtI/edit#gid=0

9\. Total cell number was: | 18 320 000 |

10\. Calculate the required volume cell suspension & freeze medium to generate
a concentration of ~1M cells/mL.




11\. Prepared  30 mL Freeze Medium: (FBS + 10% DMSO). ID #  

Stored at 4ºC until use to keep chilled.

12\. Centrifuged cells at 650 x g for 5 min.  10:55  \-  11: 00

Whilst centrifuge is spinning, prepared & printed vial labels, labelled
cryovials. (Note that passage number will be the same as the culture you
harvest from. The passage number will increase by 1 during the revive of a
vial.)




13\. Aspirated supernatant carefully, taking care not to disturb the pellet.

14\. Resuspended the pellet in | 18 |mL freeze media (chilled, to reduce DMSO
toxicity).

15\. Aliquotted | 1000 |µL into |18  | x cryovials (already labelled).

16\. Tightened the lids & transfer the cryovials to a Mr. Frosty immediately
into the -80ºC freezer.  11 :20   a/pm

  * [X]  With foam
  * [ ]  Without foam
  * [ ]  1st Freeze
  * [ ]  2nd Freeze
  * [X]  3rd Freeze
  * [ ]  4th Freeze
  * [ ]  5th Freeze

17\. Allow the cells to freeze for at least 18-24 hours before transferring to
Liquid Nitrogen storage.

Banked 18 million late passage DOLLY12 fibroblasts.
