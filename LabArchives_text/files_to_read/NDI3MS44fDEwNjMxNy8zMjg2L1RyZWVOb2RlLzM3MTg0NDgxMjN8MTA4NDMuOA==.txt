Process 50mL shaker flasks:

  1. Paused shaker by pressing the "play" button on the controller on the side wall of the incubator
  2. Collected culture vessel from shaker, wiped with ethanol-sprayed cloth and brought into BSC 
  3. Using a 5 mL serological pipette, gently pipette-mixed culture for 1 minute to break up cell clumps
  4. Pipetted suspension though 70 um cell strainer into 1 x 50 mL tube
  5. Centrifuged at 300 x g for 5 min. 15:47 - 15:52, 15:53 - 15:58
  6. Aspirated 5 mL of supernatant, taking care to not disrupt or aspirate pellet 
  7. Re-suspended cultures in fresh 5 ml of appropriate media using serological.
  8. Took 1 x 100 uL sample from 5 mL cell suspension and followed procedure in entry below to count cells.
  9. Gently pipette-mixed cultures again before moving back to spin tubes 
  10. Returned vessel to incubator and replaced in clamp. 16:10, 16:20,

### Staining Process for cell count

  1. Prepared stain buffers
    1. Made enough Hoechst/PI buffer to stain 6 samples, 300 uL per sample ( 2mL):
    2. Filtered 10 mL dPBS to remove any debris, used 0.2 or 0.45 um pore size syringe filter
    3. Combined the following:
      1. 2 mL of filtered dPBS 
      2. 2 drops (~50 uL) of NucBlue Live Cell Stain ReadyProbes Hoechst 33342
      3. 2 drops (~50 uL) of NucGreen Dead 488 Cell Stain ReadyProbes Sytox Green  

  2. Prepared 6wells in a 96 well plate, each containing:
    1. 20 uL of sample from culture
    2. 80 uL of stain buffer
  3. Incubated culture in stain for 10-20 minutes (signal intensified as incubation time increased) at room temperature in the dark  14:03 - : 
  4. Centrifuged the 96 well plate at 650 RCF for 1 minute. Timestamp: 16:00 - 16:01
  5. Took phase contrast, blue fluorescence and red fluorescence micrographs of each well
  6. Counted total cells (blue fluorescent nuclei, stained with Hoechst33342) and dead cells (red fluorescent nuclei, stained with propidium iodide OR green fluorescent nuclei, stained with Sytox green)




Stain and image:

  1. Took 100 uL samples of each spin tube culture, transferred to wells in 96 well plate
  2. Prepared stain buffer of equal volumes of NucBlue and NucGreen reagents (M6457)
  3. Added 10 uL of stain buffer to each well, pipet mixed each well
  4. Incubated at room temperature in the dark for 10-20 minutes 15:43 - 15:55
  5. Centrifuged at 650 RCF for 1 minutes   

  6. Took images of each well on the blue and green fluorescence channels using the Zaber on culture 7502 EPIC21187-EPIC22603, below correspond to wells in row A:
    1. Culture ID 7342
    2. Culture ID 7415
    3. Culture ID 7665
    4. Culture ID 7666
    5. Culture ID 7667
    6. Culture ID 7668
    7. Culture ID 7669
    8. Culture ID 7670
  7. Took 100 uL samples of each E125 culture, transferred to wells in 96 well plate
  8. Added 10 uL of stain buffer to each well, pipet mixed each well
  9. Incubated at room temperature in the dark for 10-20 minutes 17:11 - 17:21
  10. Centrifuged at 650 RCF for 1 minute
  11. Took images of each well on the blue and green fluorescence channels using the Zaber on culture 7502 EPIC21187-EPIC22603, listed below:
    1. Culture ID 7690 (E1)
    2. Culture ID 7692 (E2)
