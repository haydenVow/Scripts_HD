Note  
  
There have been ongoing concerns around the reliability of the Hoechst stain
and Mia Macro method for cell counting. For this reason, I conducted trypan
blue staining, as well as counting with the Scepter hand held counting device
today. I also did a counter stain for the Hoechst method, using Nuc green dead
cell stain.

Process:  

  1. Place media in water bath >15min prior to use
  2. Collected E125s from shaker, wiped with ethanol-sprayed Rediwipe, and brought into BSC 
  3. Using a 25 mL serological pipette, gently pipette-mixed culture for 1 minute to break up cell clumps
  4. Transfer suspension into 50 mL tubes, passing through a 70um cell filter. 
  5. Centrifuged 50 mL tubes at 300 x g for 5 mins 
  6. Aspirated  75% (15 mL) of supernatant, taking extra care to not disrupt or aspirate pellet.
  7. Resuspended each pellet in the remaining 5mL of media, and took 30ul samples for haemocytometer counts + 85ul samples for Scepter counts. 
  8. Performed Scepter and haemocytometer counts (see below for counts). Note that not all cultures were counted using the Scepter, due to low availability of the Sceptor probes. For the Sceptor, counts were gated to objects sized 10um or larger. 
  9. Topped up each 50 mL centrifuge tube with 15 mL of fresh pre-warmed media and resuspended cell pellet. 
  10. Gently pipette-mixed cultures, and transfer all cultures to E250 flask
  11. Took 1x 100 uL sample loaded onto a 96 well plate according to the plate map. 
  12. Returned E250 to incubator

Staining

Prepared Hoechst stain (50 ug/mL) solution in amber/black centrifuge tube:  
\- 9500uL MilliQ  
\- 500uL Hoechst Trihydrochloride trihydrate (1mg/mL)  
\- Vortex for 5 seconds to mix. Solution can be stored at 4Â°C for up to 6
months

Prepared Nuc Green dead stain - 1 drop in 1mL MilliQ.

  1. Took 100 uL samples from each culture flask
  2. Added 150ul MilliQ water
  3. Spun plate containing samples for 1m at 300g.
  4. Gently removed 150ul media from each sample and discarded.
  5. Added 20 uL of Hoechst diluted stain directly to cells.
  6. Added 80ul of Nuc green stain. 
  7. Incubated for 30 minutes in the dark at room temperature  
  8. Made 4x, 8x, and 16x dilutions of the sample in dPBS 
  9. Added an additional 100ul of MilliQ to each well. 
  10. Centrifuged plates at 300 g for 1 minute 
  11. Removed 100ul MilliQ. 
  12. Prepared plate map: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1mbPGdUqBRgpArnov0gMqgCKX8m85J9PstiwDgi4pggA/edit#gid=698754547
  13. Plate ID: 10544 Link: https://ranger.vow.tools/#/session/recrJlhivxGA9Xq7V/images
  14. Imaged on the Zaber with 30ms exposure DAPI, 50ms 488 and 5ms phase, then sent for to Mia for cell count analysis. Results here: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1YuTvXJXQQMIMwRZGeqNjdi20WeURg5FpM-1TJ-zrb1c/edit#gid=2066571586

Observations/Summary:

All cultures were filtered today. Large, visible clumps were observed in
Nuvonis cultures.  
  
When conducting haemocytometer counts, The BOBBY culture in Nuvonis media was
the only one which contained cells with a clearly healthy morphology, that
being large, plump steroid cells which excluded trypan blue.  
  
With the exception of the BOBBY culture in Nuvonis media, none of the cultures
contained cells at high enough density to obtain accurate counts in a 5mL
total volume.  
  
As all cultures in OptiPRO media contained virtually no cells, they were
discarded today. They were also observed under the microscope at the last
count (during XTT assay), where very few cells were observed.
