Process:

  1. Removed E2000 flasks from Eppendorf shaking incubator
  2. Mixed cultures by vigorous manual swirling then took 1 mL sample from each
  3. Transferred cultures to 6 x 250 mL centrifuge tubes
  4. Centrifuged at 650 RCF for 5 minutes (performed cell counts while waiting, see below) 18:50 - 18:55
  5. Weighed a clean 50 mL centrifuge tube (may need to use a 250 mL tube if pellets are very large)
    1. Mass of tube: 
      1. 12.4462g 
      2. 12.3704g
  6. Aspirated supernatants, leaving ~5 mL on top of each pellet, resuspended each pellet, then transferred the resuspended pellets to the pre-weighed 50 mL centrifuge tube
  7. Washed each used tube with dPBS, transferred wash to pre-weighed 50 mL tube
  8. Centrifuged 50 mL tube at 650 RCF for 5 minutes (performed cell counts while waiting, see below)
  9. Aspirated and discarded supernatant
  10. Washed the pellet twice by resuspending in dPBS followed by centrifugation and discard of supernatant:
    1. Wash 1 time
    2. Wash 2 time
  11. Weighed the 50 mL tube containing the pellet
    1. Mass of tube and pellet:
      1. 30.3714g
      2. 21.3111g
  12. Sealed the 50 mL tube with lid and parafilm, then transferred to the tall white fridge in the room next to the bathrooms in the culinary center for Chef Adem
  13. Performed cell counts:
    1. Count culture 1:3,927,000,000
    2. Count culture 2:4,893,000,000
    3. Total count:8.82 billion cells  




### Observations/Summary:

Mass of pellet = 26.8659g

Total cell count = 8.82 billion cells

Mass of cell = [26.8659] / [8820000000] = 3.04602041e-9

  

  

Cultures smell a bit strange, particularly 7922. Smell is similar the a mopped
floor or clothing that has not been dried properly.
