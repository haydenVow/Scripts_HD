Process

  1. Placed 10 mL of growth media in the water bath at 37C 12:50  

  2. Culture vessels removed from the incubator  12:45 (for imaging)  13:05 (for feed)  
  

  3. Each vessel was examined under the microscope and imaged at 10x and 20x magnifications. Observations were recorded in the table bellow 
  4. Culture 9413 (WALLE08) was terminated today as only a few cells were observed attached to the vessel.  
  

  5. Removed 50% of the media from each well.    
  
  

  6. Replaced with 2.5 mL (T25) and 0.5ml (12 well plate) of pre-warmed growth media.  
  

  7. Culture vessels returned to library lab incubator 77, 37C and 5% CO2   12:54 (for imaging)  13:08 (for feed)
