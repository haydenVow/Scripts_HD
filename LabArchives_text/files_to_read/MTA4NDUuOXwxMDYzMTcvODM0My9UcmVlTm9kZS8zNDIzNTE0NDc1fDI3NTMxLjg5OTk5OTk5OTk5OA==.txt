RELATED TO OKR:  Increase cell density to 25g/mL

AIM/PURPOSE: To determine if there is a difference in cell viability or
proliferation rate at high and low pH and compressed air-flow rates for
Nuvonis suspension cells

HYPOTHESIS: It is hypothesised that cells will demonstrate a preference for
either a higher or lower pH and or air-flow rate condition, indicated by
increased viability and or increased growth rate.
