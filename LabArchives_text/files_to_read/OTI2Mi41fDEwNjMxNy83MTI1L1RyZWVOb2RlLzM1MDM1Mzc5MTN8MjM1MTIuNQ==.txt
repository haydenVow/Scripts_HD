Process:  

  1. Place media in water bath >15min prior to use 
  2. Collected E125s from shaker, wiped with ethanol-sprayed Rediwipe, and brought into BSC 
  3. Using a 25 mL serological pipette, gently pipette-mixed culture for 1 minute to break up cell clumps
  4. Transfer suspension into 50 mL tubes.
  5. Centrifuged 50 mL tubes at 300 x g for 5 mins 
  6. Aspirated  50% (10 mL) of supernatant, taking extra care to not disrupt or aspirate pellet.
  7. Topped up each 50 mL centrifuge tube with 15 mL of fresh pre-warmed media and resuspended cell pellet. 
  8. Gently pipette-mixed cultures, and transfer all cultures to E250 flask 
  9. Took 2x 100 uL sample loaded onto a 96 well plate according to the plate map.
  10. Also took 1x 150ul sampled for xtt (see lab book here: 
  11. Returned E250 to incubator 

incubator 160 Library Lab, 37C, 5% CO2




Staining

Prepared Hoechst stain (50 ug/mL) solution in amber/black centrifuge tube:  
\- 9500uL MilliQ  
\- 500uL Hoechst Trihydrochloride trihydrate (1mg/mL)  
\- Vortex for 5 seconds to mix. Solution can be stored at 4Â°C for up to 6
months  
  
Created a working stock of 20% 1gm/mL solution in MilliQ on 24/02/22  

  1. Took 100 uL samples from each culture flask, added to wells pre-loaded with 150ul Milliq
  2. Centrifuged for 5min at 300g
  3. Gently removed 150ul of media/milliq from the surface of the wells.
  4. Added 100 uL of Hoechst working stain directly to cells
  5. Incubated for 30 minutes in the dark at room temperature 
  6. Made 4x, 8x and 16x and dilutions of the sample in dPBS 
  7. Centrifuged plates at 300 g for 1 minute 
  8. Prepared plate map:
  9. Plate ID: 10544 Link: https://ranger.vow.tools/#/session/recrJlhivxGA9Xq7V/images
  10. Imaged on the Zaber, then sent for to Mia for cell count analysis. Results here: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1YuTvXJXQQMIMwRZGeqNjdi20WeURg5FpM-1TJ-zrb1c/edit#gid=2066571586
