Task performed by Lily Logan

Process:

Please observe rows B+ F under florescence (DAPI channel). If you can see
anything, please take a few images of 1 sample in each row at both 5x and 10x

1\. Remove pre-prepared aliquots from the fridge. Placed in water bath   14:50  

2\. Removed  100  % of supernatant from vessel.

3\. Replaced with  200 uL (per well/per vessel) of E6 media.

4\. Returned vessel to incubate at:

  * [x ]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (aviary cells)

  

  * [X]  Thermo Incubator (ID #13)
  * [ ]  Top Sanyo Incubator (ID #25)
  * [ ]  Bottom Sanyo Incubator
  * [ ]  Top Binder Incubator
  * [ ]  Bottom Binder Incubator
