Media/Reagents used:

NameDetails  
  
Growth Media  
  
Growth Media + 10uM ROCKi  
  
Growth Media + 10uM ROCKi + 1:100 Anti-clumping Agent  
  
Growth Media + 0.1% w/v Pluronic  
  
  
  




Process:

1\. Place the pre-aliquotted  10 mL  mL of each respective type of Growth
Media into the water bath   14:23 pm

2\. Placed shake tubes in centrifuge and centrifuge at 650 x g for 5 min at
RT.   14:45 pm

Aspirated supernatant from each pellet

Added 1mL of respective growth media to each tube and used a P1000 pipette to
break up cell clumps.

Remaining 9mL of each respective media was added afterwards and triturated
with 10mL serological pipette to break up cell clumps for each culture further
and resuspend cells evenly.

10uL of each culture taken for viability check

4\. Returned vessel to incubate at:   15:13 pm

  * [X ]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (aviary cells)

Observations:

Serum Ctrl Low - Cloudy sup. 1 large clump and many med/small clumps

Serum Ctrl High - Very cloudy sup. 1 large clump and many med/small clumps

ROCKi - Cloudy sup. 1 large circular clump and no other clumps

ROCKi + ACA - Cloudy sup. 1 large circular clump and no other clumps

Pluronic - Cloudy sup. 1 large clump and 3-4 med/small clumps

  

 100  % media changed on vessel(s)

  




### Results

  * Results were;
    * [ ]  As Usual (this is a repetitive task)
    * [ ]  Unexpected because...
    * [ X]  Need to be further analysed (this will be graphed along with continual viability and cell count measurements over the course of the experiment to plot cell survival
    * [ ]  Other (.......)
