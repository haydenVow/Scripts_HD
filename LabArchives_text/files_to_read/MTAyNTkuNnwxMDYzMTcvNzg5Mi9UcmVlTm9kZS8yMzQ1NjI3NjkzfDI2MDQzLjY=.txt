# Observations of Biopsy round 1:

  1. #### Please remove the culture plate from the incubator and observe using the axio microscope at 10x phase or 20x if this is easier.

  2. #### Observe the wells that have a yellow sticker placed near them and search for any normal or abnormal cell morphology.

    * #### Examples of Observations can include:

      * #### Cloudy growth media indicative of a potential contamination 

      * #### Cells (fibroblast-like) adhered to the cell culture plate 

      * #### A lot of debris suspended in the growth medium. 

  3. #### Write any interesting findings in the green columns for Biopsy round 1 and 2.

  4. #### Return the cell culture plate to their respective incubator (noted in the table below).
