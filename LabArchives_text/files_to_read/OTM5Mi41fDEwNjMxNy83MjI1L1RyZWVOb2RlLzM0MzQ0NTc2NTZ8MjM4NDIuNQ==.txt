Took samples

  1. Sprayed down the sample line end with 70% ethanol.
  2. Connected a 5 mL sterile syringe.
  3. Withdrew 1 mL (first-draw)
  4. Disconnected sample syringe and transferred 1 mL of sample each to 1.5 mL Eppendorf tubes for cell count
  5. Connected a fresh sterile syringe and withdrew 1 mL of sample (second-draw).
  6. Disconnected sample syringe and transferred 1 mL of sample each to 1.5 mL Eppendorf tubes for cell count
  7. Sprayed sample line with 70% ethanol.
  8. Performed cell count:
    * 1st draw: discarded
    * 2nd draw: 44 000 cells/mL (968 000 000 total)

### Observations/Summary:

  * rocking speed: 8 rocks per min?
  * pH: 6.54
  * dissolved oxygen: 0%?
  * temperature: 37.2

Approximate cell count after seeding 50L RM bag:

~2000 mL / 2400 mL (original) * 2.2848B = ~1.904B cells

Approximate cell count at present:

44,000 cells / mL (968M cells total)

Change in cell count:

1.9B -> 1.7B -> 1.14B -> ~1B -> 968M
