We are observing unexpected high cell numbers in the control suspension tube,
#10545, relative to the other suspension tubes in this round. Because of this
we've decided to take an aliquot of the suspension to perform a DNA extraction
on. We suspect that we may have mislabeled the tubes at some point and this
tube may potentially contain one of our mutated cultures. We will be
performing PCR on this extracted sample against PTEN, PABPC1 and IGFBP4 primer
sets to ensure that this sample is indeed a wild type culture.  
  
There is always the possibility that this culture contains separate mutations
under the suspension selection pressures.  
  
Protocol for DNA extraction was performed as follows.

  1. 90uL of suspension culture was transferred to a PCR tube. 
  2. Tube was spun in a benchtop minifuge for 2 minutes (unknown speed)
  3. supernatant was aspirated and 25uL of quick extract (a10469) was added to the tube
  4. spin the tube for 15 seconds to get any loose cells into the quick extract.
  5. The tube was subjected to the following heating protocol,
    1. 65 degrees C for 6 minutes
    2. 98 degrees for 120 seconds
  6. Tube was left at room temperature







PCR amplification using BENTOLAB

Quick mix DNA extraction of CHOMP07, Control Round 2 suspension culture was
removed from the fridge.

3 reaction tubes were made as per the protocol below, each using a different
primer set targeted to PABPC1, PTEN and IGFBP4

Primers used:  
P41 + P2 - PABPC1  
P39 + P40 - PTEN  
P7 + P8 - IGFBP4

  1. Made up a master mix for 2x reactions for primer sets above (# of reactions +1).  Below are intended volumes for 1x 25uL reaction.

  2. Obtained 0.2 mL PCR tubes
  3. Added 25μl of respective primer MM to each sample tube as per the table above
  4. Added 1μl of wild type CHOMP07 DNA extract to each tube, added 4uL of MilliQ to each tube to make a total reaction volume of 30uL.
  5. Took samples to the PCR machine and set the settings to (melting temp for primers used was 61 degress C).  

  6. Samples were placed in a yellow top container and placed in the fridge in Main lab.
