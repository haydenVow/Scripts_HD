NameDetails (reagent ID)  
CDM4 Avian + 2.5mM Glutamax S 2625 + 5471  
Nuvonis Suspension Media baseA10904  
  
EGF (added to all medias)M 9201  
  
IGF (added to all medias)M 10839  
  
MEMS 5365  
  
Glutamax  
S 5471  
  
Yeast extract A 10501  
  
  




Note

Cell numbers remain relatively stable (small decrease in today), despite the
addition of non-essential AA and aditional Glutamax at the last feed. Today,
the addition of 1:100 essential AA and an additional yeast extract will be
trailed (total conc now 2g/L in both).  
  
EDIT: Only 1:1000 AA was added to the Nuvonis media culture in error.




Process:  

  1. Place media in water bath >15min prior to use
  2. Collected E125s from shaker, wiped with ethanol-sprayed Rediwipe, and brought into BSC 
  3. Using a 25 mL serological pipette, gently pipette-mixed culture for a few minutes to break up cell clumps
  4. Passed once through 20G needle to break up cell clumps
  5. Transfer suspension into 50 mL tubes.
  6. Centrifuged 50 mL tubes at 300 x g for 5 mins 
  7. Aspirated  75% (15 mL) of supernatant, taking extra care to not disrupt or aspirate pellet.
  8. Resuspended each pellet in the remaining 5mL of media, and took 2x 10ul samples from each culture for hemocytometer counts 
  9. Performed  hemocytometer counts (see below for counts).
  10. Topped up each 50 mL centrifuge tube with 15 mL of fresh pre-warmed media and resuspended cell pellet. 
  11. Pipette-mixed cultures, and transfer all cultures to E250 flask
  12. Returned E250 to incubator
