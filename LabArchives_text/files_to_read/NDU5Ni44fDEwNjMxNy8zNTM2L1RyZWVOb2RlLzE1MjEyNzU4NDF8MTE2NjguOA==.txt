Process:

  1. Aliquotted   20 mL  mL of  E6 Media  (Note that E6 media that has been aliquoted is for multiple experiments)
  2. Placed in water bath   10:35am  
  3. Removed plate from the incubator and place in BSC (lights off)
  4. Remove parafilm from plate. 
  5. Anchor points can come off gel during lid removal, placed back in gel using sterile tweezers!
  6. Carefully remove  100 % of supernatant from each well with a p1000. See tips below:
    1. You can use the same tip across the samples containing cells, however switch tips for the control. Refer to plate map for the position. 
    2. Place tip on the bottom side of the well and slowly aspirate
    3. Be careful not to touch or suck up the gel
    4. Tilting the plate slightly may help, however try not to dislodge the gel from the inserts
  7. Replaced with  1.5 mL (per well/per vessel) of  E6  media. 
    1. Slowly release the media onto the side of the well and NOT directly on the gel.  
  8. Parafilm plate and return vessel to incubate at: 

  * [X]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (aviary cells)

  

  * Incubator (#THERMO ), Lab [Main/Library/Production]




### Observations/Summary:

 100 % media changed on vessel(s)

  1. 24 well plate
  2.   

  3. Significant amounts of yellow media observed on the leftside wells of the plate, likely to be cells expending nutrients quickly due to high seeding density
  4. 1.5mL is too much volume for some of these wells, risk of spilling media out of wells.
