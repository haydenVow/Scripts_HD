Note: Copy the value for 'viable cells per mL' from Vicell  anc record in the
master cell count spreadsheet, with the respective culture ID and the volume
of growth medium the cells are being cultured in.

  1. 125mL aliquot was taken into 1 x 250mL sterile pot. 
  2. Growth factors were added to the growth media aliquot.
    1. 125uL of IGF-LR3 (mesokine) added
    2. 25uL of rEGF (mesokine) added  
Note: Calculate the amount of growth factor needed for the volume of aliquoted
growth medium by using the E8 Calculator.

  3. Aliquot placed in water bath1:40
  4. 42M cells (entire cell suspension) taken into 1 x 50mL tube and centrifuged at 500 x g for 5 min at RT.
    1. Start 12:04 
    2. End 12:09
  5. Supernatant aspirated.
  6. The pellet was resuspended in 125mL of Growth Media prepared above.
  7. Cells seeded into 1 x E500 flask (flat bottom)

  9. Placed flask in the incubator 12:23 (37 C, 5% CO2, 120 RPM)  

Seed flask details:

  * Seeding density: 0.297 x10^6 cells / mL (target was 300,000)
  * Growth Medium Volume in the seed flask: 125mL
  * Flask size: E500 (flat bottom)




## Summary/ Results

Nuvonis cells were expanded from 1xE125 flask into 1xE500 flask.  
  
After a initial cell count using the Vicell (41.89M cells) we seeded the
entire cell suspension into 125mL of growth medium
(hycell+nuvonisGM:RPMI+nuvonis) to seed into 1x E500 flask. We then completed
another final cell count which found the total cells to be 37,125,000 cells
(297,000 cells per mL), and placed the new flask in the incubator (37C, 5%CO2,
120RPM).
