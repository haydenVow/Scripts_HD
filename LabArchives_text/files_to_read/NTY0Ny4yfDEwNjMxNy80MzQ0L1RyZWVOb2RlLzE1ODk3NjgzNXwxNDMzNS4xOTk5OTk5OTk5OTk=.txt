###  

Volumes added into the growth media:

197.5 ml DMEM/F12

100ml FBS

5 ml P/S

  

for the 90 ml of growth media used today, add 45 ul (total volume in ml
divided by 2 in ul)

  




  
  

Prepare materials for thaw and seed:

  * NOTE: IF PERFORMING A THAW FROM A CLONAL MCB_2 OR WCB_2, PREPARE AT LEAST ONE EXTRA 96 WELL PLATE FOR A DIFFERENTIATION ASSAY. THIS IS AN IMPORTANT QUALITY CONTROL STEP WHILE WE BUILD OUR CLONAL CELL BANK.
  * Suggested layout for diff assay (please refer to previous diff assays for exact seeding, feeding and analysis procedures)  

  * 

1\. Gelatin coated   3 x   T175 flasks/plates with sterile filtered 0.1%
gelatin solution and then incubated all coated flasks at 37ºC

  * Time when all flasks placed into the incubator1:39 : 3:45  pm 

2\. Aliquotted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then
placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath for a minimum of 20 minutes
prior to use:

  *  Growth media (for seeding):  90  mL 
  * Time that aliquot was placed in the water bath to warm before use:  3:00 - 3:30 pm 

  




## Thaw and seed vial:

3\. Collected the cryovial from Liquid Nitrogen storage & place in foam
floater in water bath for 5 min 3:43 - 3:48 pm

Location where cryovial was collected from:

Vial details:  1   x  DOLLY12  cryovials at  1M cells each for a total of   1M
cells

Brew: Liquid Nitrogen  

Tower/Bucket #: 4  

Box/Cane #: 2  

Vial location: H3  

Vial ID(s): 2623  

`4. Ethanol sprayed & transferred the vial(s) to the BSC.`

`5.  Added  500 µL of Growth Media (to generate a total volume of 1mL in the
cryovial) to the cryovial, resuspended the cell suspension gently to reduce
osmotic shock. `

`6. Collected 500ul of cell suspension (to obtain 500 K cells) & transfer into
the pre-warmed tube of Growth Media. `

`7. Using a 10mL serological pipette, resuspended & distributed the cells
evenly in the  90 mL of pre-warmed Growth Media (prepared in Step 2). `

`8. Transfered 30  mL to each pre-coated  T175  flask/well, allow to rest in
the BSC at RT for 30 min  4:00 - 4:30pm `

`9. Transfered flask/plate(s) to incubate at: 4:36 pm

  * [X]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (aviary cells)

Making labels

Note - You will need to increase the passage number by one. (i.e. if your
thawed vial ID has a passage number of 3, when you make a culture ID for you
vessel you will need change the passage number to 4 on Airtable.)
