This Lab Archive entry refers to all feeds performed during this experiment.
Please refer to the rich text box that is relevant to the feed you will be
completed and fill in the details of the table, where relevant.

Process:

  1. Aliquotted  200 mL  mL of  GM listed in table above. 
  2. Placed in water bath for 10-20 minutes minimum
  3. Take 1-2x images of the entire plate.  
    1. Notes for image taking and observations: 
      1. Take a clear image of the plate using the lab-iPad positioned vertically above the plate to ensure you have a clear view of the tissue structures in each well. This will ensure we can efficiently compare the changes in the tissue formation between each feed.
      2. Please copy the image of the plate under the 'Relevant Images' section below.
  4. Removed   100% of supernatant from vessel.. 
  5. Replaced with  200 mL (per well/per vessel) of  growth media (listed above) 
  6. Place lid on container (PLEASE DO NOT make the culture vessel air-tight to ensure gas movement). 
  7. Returned vessel to incubate. 

  * [X ]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (aviary cells)
