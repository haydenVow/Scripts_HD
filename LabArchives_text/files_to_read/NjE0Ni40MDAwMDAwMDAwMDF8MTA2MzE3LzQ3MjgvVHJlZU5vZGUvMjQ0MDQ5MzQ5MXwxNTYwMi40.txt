Process:

  1. Aliquotted  21 mL  mL of  E6 Media 
  2. Placed in water bath 13:14 - 16:15  
  3. Removed 100% of supernatant from vessel. 
  4. Replaced with 1mL (per well/per vessel) of E6 media. 
  5. Returned vessel to incubate at: 16:39

  * [X]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (aviary cells)

  

  * Incubator (#120), Lab Main




### Observations/Summary:

 100 % media changed on all vessel(s)

Laminin, Gelatin and MyoCult were fully confluent prior to changing to E6 diff
media  

Collagen wells looked spider webby with many cells clustering around a central
node across the plate  

ECM wells still look chaotic - cell death apparent, flaking of ECM? apparent

Alginate wells reflect that more proliferation has occurred, need to observe
how the B / C rows progress  

Fibrin membrane still present, cells seem to be seeded underneath,
proliferating ok
