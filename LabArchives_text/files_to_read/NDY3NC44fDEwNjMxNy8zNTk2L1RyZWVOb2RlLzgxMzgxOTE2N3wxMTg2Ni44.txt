2\. Aliquoted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then
placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath for a minimum of 20 minutes
prior to use: Reagents warmed to 30 degrees C

  *  Growth media (for seeding):    3 mL
  *  Growth media for washing:   5  mL
  * Time that aliquots were placed in the water bath to warm before use:   10:35

  




## Thaw and seed vial:

3\. Collected the cryovial from -80C storage & place in foam floater in  30
degrees Celsius water bath for 5 min  13:34

Location where cryovial was collected from: -80C freezer (still in Mr Frosty)  

Vial details:  1   x  raw isolate (CHOMP9)  cryovials at   unknown  cells each
for a total of   unknown  cells

Vial ID(s): 141-Arms/legs-16-Crocodile-QLD

4\. Ethanol sprayed and transferred the vial to the BSC.

5\. Added 500ul of wash growth media and resuspended the cells gently to
reduce osmotic shock.

6\. Collected the entire 1 ml of cell suspension and transferred into the pre-
warmed wash growth media.

7\. Using P1000, gently resuspended and distributed the cells evenly in the
5mL of pre-warmed growth media to wash.

8\. Centrifuge at 500x g for 5 minutes

9\. Resuspend in 3mL growth media

10\. Transferred the cell suspension to 1 well of a 6-well plate

`11.  Transferred flask/plate(s) to incubate at: `13:50`
