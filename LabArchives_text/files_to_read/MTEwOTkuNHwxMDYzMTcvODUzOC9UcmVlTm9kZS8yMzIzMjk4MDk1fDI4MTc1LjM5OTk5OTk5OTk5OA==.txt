Aim


To further explore the occurrence of the plugs (hence known as "pork buns")
that resulted from the autoclaving of a biogel formulation (2% Alginate, 1%
Xanthan, 1% Glucomannan, 2% Methocellulose).

Main goals:  
\- Recreate the incidence of the "plugs"

\- Determine how they are formed

\- See if the scale can be increased

\- Determine how long they take to rehydrate completely


Hypothesis


When the biogel is autoclaved at 121C and 15 psi (1 atm or 103 kpa) with
steam, the biogel bubbles up an forms a foam like plug. This can be recreated
by putting the biogel in a shallow wide dish and allowed to full bake. Full
rehydration will take longer than 24 hrs.


Method


Pork Bun Gel Creation

1\. Weigh out all biomaterial powders (see below) and combine together into a
homogenous powder.

\- 2% (w/v) Low viscosity alginate

\- 2% (w/v)  Metho cellulose (Sigma Aldrich Brand)

\- 1% (w/v) Xanthan Gum

\- 1% (w/v) Glucomannan

2.Hydrate various biomaterials in PBS. Stir with a spatula until mostly
dissolved. If clumps form, try pushing against the side of the jar.

3\. Leave for 1hr in room temperature

4\. Stir to ensure a homogenous biogel, incorporate air in to form bubbles

6\. Refrigerate remaining gel overnight at 4C (Note: The Pork Bun Creation
method was tested using biogel that had and had not been refrigerated
overnight)

  

Pork Bun Creation - (Repeated with biogel freshly made and biogel refrigerated
overnight)

1\. 40 g of biogel were placed into one 100mL glass jar (polypropylene lid),
one 50 ml glass jar (polypropylene lid), one 190mL jar (silicon lid) and one
pie tin

2\. 20 g of biogel was placed into one pie tin

2\. 700 mL of water were poured into the bottom of the pressure cooker

3\. The containers with biogel were placed into the pressure cooker making
sure the lids were loosened/lightly placed on top

4\. The pressure cooker was turned on and set to pressure cook at 114 C for 30
minutes

5\. Once the process finished the pressure cooker was left in the 'keep warm'
function as it released steam for ~30 minutes

6\. Containers were removed from the pressure cooker

7\. Specimens were removed from the containers and divided into four equal
parts

  

Gel Rehydration

1\. Divided specimens from the pork bun creation process were placed into 6
well plates and their initial weight noted (specimen jars were also used as
containers due to availability)

2\. Specimens were left over night in their containers

3\. PBS was added to each well/jar to begin hydration process

4\. The specimens were removed from their containers and weighed in intervals
of 2, 4, 8 and 12 hours

Observations

No noticeable difference was noted between the pressure cooker specimens
produced from the previously refrigerated biogel however handling was slightly
easier with the refrigerated biogel due to its thicker consistency

Container / SpecimenImage(s)Notes  
40g of biogel in 100 mL Schott Jar / 'Puck'

Produced 'puck' specimen that was equivalent to those created in the
autoclave. Held together after segmentation however interior was softer than
exterior.  
40g of biogel in 50 mL Schott Jar

  

(Non-refrigerated biogel)

(refrigerated biogel)

  
Produced 'plug' specimen that was equivalent to those created in the
autoclave. Specimen was white straight after removal from pressure cooker and
changed colour slightly after removal. Texture was tougher compared to 'puck'
specimen with more resistance when cut.  
40g of biogel in 190 mL Silicon Lid Jar

Produced 'puck' specimen that was thicker and tougher than those produced in
the 100mL Schott Jar. Similar texture to the 'plug' specimen suggesting it
become more dehydrated in this container than in the Schott Jar. Held together
well after segmenting.  
40g of biogel in pie tin  
Produced thick 'pan' that was similar in texture to the puck produced in the
100mL Schott Jar. Held together after segmentation.  
20g of biogel in pie tin

  
Produced thin pan that was difficult to handle without breaking/tearing.
