Aim


Pump muscle and fibroblast cells full of creatine


Hypothesis


             

Exposing cells to media conditioned with creatine will not have a negative
effect on cell survival


Timeline and protocol


Cell choice  
  
DOLLY Myoblasts

CHOMP Fibroblasts

  
Creatine is an energy source (converting ADP to ATP), which is why presence is
so high in muscle (a very energy intensive cell type). Fibroblasts do not
require as much energy as active muscle cells and so the maximum creatine
content we can achieve in fibroblasts will definitely be lower than in muscle
cells. For this reason the initial experiment will use DOLLY muscle cells and
run this in parrallel with CHOMP fibroblasts to see how they compare.  
  
Creatine concentrations  
Literature has shown that 5mM creatine in diff media can be used to promote
the fusion of myoblasts and myosin heavy chain type II and troponin T
expression. This concentration of creatine was chosen because it had the
largest effect on the growth of C2C12 cells when investigated by Louis et al.,
2004, who looked at concentrations of 1, 5, 10 and 20 mM. From the results of
this experiment we can assume that 5 and 20mM creatine is not toxic to our
cells and can subsequently use them as a starting point.  
  
FYI I (EH) also considered basing creatine concentration on what is typically
found in meat. Literature has suggested that cooked chicken, beef and rabbit
meat contains approximately 30mmol kg-1 of creatine. When I calculated what
the weight of our cells would be in one T175 the equivalent concentration
would only be 0.0164mM of creatine. See calculation below. This concentration
of creatine is much lower than what is typically used in media supplementation
to improve myotube formation. Seeing as we are looking to significantly
enhance creatine availability in our cells I decided on higher concentrations.

see row 34. DOLLY myoblasts in 4x4CF flasks had a pellet weight of 0.948g. One
4CF flask has the surface area of 2528cm2 and 175F has 175cm2. Four 4CF flasks
have a combined surface area of 10112cm2. 10112/175 = 57.8. 0.948/57.8 =
0.0164g. In one 175 flask we can estimate the cell weight to be ~0.0164g
(0.0000164kg). If we want 30mmol kg-1, and only have 0.0000164kg, 0.0000164 x
30 = 0.000492 mmol kg-1 which in 30ml (with 1000ml in a l) would be 0.000492 /
0.03, which is only 0.0164 mM.  
  
Concentrations we will test:  
  
Conc 1 = 0mM  
Conc 2 = 5mM  
Conc 3 = 50mM  
Conc 4 = 200mM  
Conc 5 = 500mM

NOTE  
Downstream analysis of this experiment will include 3 forms of analysis:
ELISA, Bradford assay and Creatinine assay. In attempt to have enough cells
for all three forms of analysis we will have 2x t175 flasks of cell per
creatine concentration.

Cell requirements of the assays:

  
ELISA: 2M cells  
Bradford: 30,000 cells (lowest!)  
Creatinine: 2M cells  
  
Total cells for each media condition needs to be ~2030000

`Friday 25/02/22`  
100% feed of DOLLY cells (DMEM/F12 + 20% FBS + 1X P/S + P38i (10uM))  
  
Prepare E6 with and without creatine (380ml of each - 30ml per flask, 2x
flasks per conc, with 6 media changes plus excess):  
NOTE CALCULATION BASED ON CREATINE WITH MW OF 131.13  

0mM = 0g of creatine in 380ml diff media

5mM = 0.25g of creatine in 380ml diff media

50mM = 2.5g of creatine in 380ml diff media

200mM = 10g of creatine in 380ml diff media

500mM = 25g of creatine in 380ml diff media

Note - if 0.25g is too small to measure accurately then make up extra 50mM and
dilute 1 in 10  
  

Monday 28/02/22

Check cells - IF ~70% confluent change 100% media in flasks to E6 media with
respective creatine conc (and control E6 with no creatine). Make sure flasks
are labelled with media and creatine conc, 2 flasks per condition:  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
 \- NOTE -  
If not confluent yet everything will have to be delayed until they are
confluent and ready for diff media.

Harvest cells

Count cells with trypan blue and record the following for each flask (repeat
counts 3x per flask):

Total number of cells =

Number of dead cells =  
  
Combine cell pellets for each condition then wash each pellet 3x with ice cold
PBS.

Freeze pellet at -80C until analysis.  
  

REMINDER: Cell requirements for downstream assays:  
ELISA: 2M cells  
Bradford: 30,000 cells (lowest!)  
Creatinine: 2M cells  
Total cells for each media condition needs to be ~2030000

  
  
NOTE \- Intended analysis for these samples will be measurement of crude
protein via bradford assay, measurement of creatine content by ELISA,
measurement of creatinine by creatinine assay kit. We may need more cell mass
than 2 flasks per condition provides to accommodate all of these tests in this
instance we will need to increase flasks numbers - in this instance we may
need to order more creatine volumes and will need to make up more diff media.
To reduce creatine demand we can also remove some concentrations from testing.  
  
  

IF we are doing fibroblasts in parallel:  
  
Brief fibroblast cell experiment overview:

Thursday 24/02/22

Thaw 2x cryovial (10M cells per vial) and quickly transfer into a larger GM
volume (D/F+ 20% FBS + 1xP/S)

e.g. 10 mL of warm GM for a cell conc. of 1M/mL

Perform a cell count and record live and dead cell #'s.

Calculate live cells/mL  
  
seed 10xT175 with F_CHOMP07 fibroblasts @7500 cells/cm2 = 1,312,500 cells per
T175 flask

Place the seeded flasks directly into the 30C incubator (do not leave them in
the BSC for 30 minutes).

Friday 25/02/22  
  
Prepare growth media (D/F+ 20% FBS + 1xP/S) with creatine supplementation
(store at 4'C), 140ml per condition (30ml per flask, 2x flasks per condition,
1x 100% feed, plus excess)  
  
NOTE CALCULATION BASED ON CREATINE WITH MW OF 131.13  
  

0mM = 0g of creatine in 140ml D/F+ 20% FBS + 1xP/S

5mM = 0.09g of creatine in 140ml D/F+ 20% FBS + 1xP/S

50mM = 0.9179g of creatine in 140ml D/F+ 20% FBS + 1xP/S

200mM = 3.7g of creatine in 140ml D/F+ 20% FBS + 1xP/S

500mM = 11.8g of creatine in 140ml D/F+ 20% FBS + 1xP/S

  
Note - if 0.09g is too small to measure accurately then make up extra 50mM and
dilute 1 in 10.

  
Once media is made perform:  
  
100% media change for each flask to respective pre-warmed creatine media (30C
for 20 minutes prior to use). Label flasks well, 2x flasks per media
concentration.

  

Monday 28/02/22  
100% media change with respective creatine media

Friday 04/03/22  
Harvest cells and count the cells from each flask with trypan blue
individually to assess cell survival and infer a proliferation rate via total
cell number (compared to how many cells were seeded).  
Record for each creatine concentration condition total cell number, number of
dead cells.  
Note - live cells do not take up Trypan Blue, but dead cells are permeable and
take up the dye.

Combine pellets for same conditions. Wash pellets 3x with ice cold PBS.

Freeze pellet at -80C until analysis.  
  
REMINDER: Cell requirements for downstream assays:  
ELISA: 2M cells  
Bradford: 30,000 cells (lowest!)  
Creatinine: 2M cells  
Total cells for each media condition needs to be ~2030000

To reduce creatine demand we can also remove some concentrations from testing.  
  
  
Total amount of creatine for muscle cell experiment = ~40g  
Total amount of creatine for fibroblast cell experiment = ~16.5g  
Total amount of creatine if we run both cell types = ~56.5g  
  
NOTE- two tubs of creatine in main lab, on right as enter lab in the
cupboards, top left - from eyeballing these tubs it looks like we may have
enough to do both cell types, but we have also ordered more
