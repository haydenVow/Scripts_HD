Note  
  
There have been ongoing concerns around the reliability of the Hoechst stain
and Mia Macro method for cell counting. For this reason, I conducted trypan
blue staining, as well as counting with the Scepter hand held counting device
today. I also did a counter stain for the Hoechst method, using Nuc green dead
cell stain.  
  
As cells in Nuvonis media had a far greater cell count, and other cultures are
very low, it was decided to add IGF+ EGF to all cultures moving forward, in
attempt to kickstart them (EGF 10ug/L, IGF,50ug/L).

Process:  

  1. Place media in water bath >15min prior to use
  2. Collected E125s from shaker, wiped with ethanol-sprayed Rediwipe, and brought into BSC 
  3. Using a 25 mL serological pipette, gently pipette-mixed culture for 1 minute to break up cell clumps
  4. Transfer suspension into 50 mL tubes, passing through a 70um cell filter. 
  5. Centrifuged 50 mL tubes at 300 x g for 5 mins 
  6. Aspirated  75% (15 mL) of supernatant, taking extra care to not disrupt or aspirate pellet.
  7. Resuspended each pellet in the remaining 5mL of media, and took 30ul samples for haemocytometer counts + 85ul samples for Scepter counts. 
  8. Performed Scepter and haemocytometer counts (see below for counts). Note that not all cultures were counted using the Scepter, due to low availability of the Sceptor probes. For the Sceptor, counts were gated to objects sized 10um or larger. 
  9. Topped up each 50 mL centrifuge tube with 15 mL of fresh pre-warmed media and resuspended cell pellet. 
  10. Gently pipette-mixed cultures, and transfer all cultures to E250 flask
  11. Returned E250 to incubator

Staining

Prepared Hoechst stain (50 ug/mL) solution in amber/black centrifuge tube:  
\- 9500uL MilliQ  
\- 500uL Hoechst Trihydrochloride trihydrate (1mg/mL)  
\- Vortex for 5 seconds to mix. Solution can be stored at 4Â°C for up to 6
months

Prepared Nuc Green dead stain - 1 drop in 1mL MilliQ.

  1. Took 100 uL samples from each culture flask
  2. Added 150ul MilliQ water
  3. Spun plate containing samples for 1m at 300g.
  4. Gently removed 150ul media from each sample and discarded.
  5. Added 20 uL of Hoechst diluted stain directly to cells.
  6. Added 80ul Nuc green solution
  7. Incubated for 30 minutes in the dark at room temperature 
  8. Made 4x, 8x and 16x and dilutions of the sample in dPBS 
  9. Centrifuged plates at 300 g for 1 minute 
  10. Prepared plate map: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1L2qAABovPuZJAHEZdhpfILyei_EaVoKFP-qaDVHR5qM/edit#gid=1525200471
  11. Plate ID: 10110 Link: https://ranger.vow.tools/#/session/recrJlhivxGA9Xq7V/images
  12. Imaged on the Zaber, then sent for to Mia for cell count analysis. Results here: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1YuTvXJXQQMIMwRZGeqNjdi20WeURg5FpM-1TJ-zrb1c/edit#gid=2066571586
