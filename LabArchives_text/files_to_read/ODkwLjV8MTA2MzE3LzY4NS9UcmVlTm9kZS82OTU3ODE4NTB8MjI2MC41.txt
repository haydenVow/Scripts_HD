RELATED TO MILESTONE:  Achieve >10 doublings of DOLLY12 fibroblast clones in
ACF media in suspension.

AIM/PURPOSE:  Adapt DOLLY12 fibroblasts to ACF media in adherent culture &
determine whether we can achieve 10 doublings.

HYPOTHESIS: I hypothesise our current ACF media formulation will support
fibroblast growth.

RESULTS SUMMARY:  Due to the accidental omission of albumin in our serum free
medias in this study, we saw cell death and a lack of cellular proliferation
across all serum free medias.

CONCLUSIONS: The hypothesis was not able to be supported or disproved due to
cell death.

NEXT STEPS: This experiment will be repeated, with albumin added.
