Observations/ Images

5 of the 6 seeded wells appear contaminated. The base of the wells is covered
by a cloudy/chalky layer which can be seen by eye. Contaminants would clearly
be seen under the microscope.

Salvaging apparently uncontaminated well.

One well of the 6 well plate showed no signs of contamination so was
transferred to a fresh 96 well plate as follows.

1\. 1mltryple and2mlPBS (for washing and neutralizing)15:00  
2\. Media and tissue clumps in uncontaminated well removed transfered to
6-well plate  
3\. Uncontaminated well washed with 1ml pre-warmed PBS  
4\. Replaced PBS with pre-warmed tryple, and returned to library lab binder
incubator number 78 for 12min 16:18(all other cultures have been removed and
incubator will be de-contaminated this afternoon).  
5\. Tryple collected from well and transferred to 15ml tube.  
6\. Uncontaminated well washed with 1ml PBS, which was then added to the 15ml
tube.  
7\. Centrifuged at 650g for 5 minutes.  
8\. Supernatant aspirated and discarded.  
9\. 1ml growth media taken from the fresh 6 well plate and pellet resuspended
in this media before returning to the plate.  
10\. Plate put in incubator 77 at 37 degrees C and 5% CO2 16:35
