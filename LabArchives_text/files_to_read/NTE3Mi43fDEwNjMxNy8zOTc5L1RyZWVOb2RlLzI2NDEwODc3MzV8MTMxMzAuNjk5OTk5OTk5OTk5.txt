###  




Process:

  1. Aliquoted growth media as follows:
    1. 35 mL of serum control media
      * Placed in water bath   15:10       

  2. Prepared stain buffer in 15 mL tube by combining the following (1 drop of each stain solution per 1 mL of dPBS):
    * 3 mL of dPBS 
    * 6 drops of NucBlue Live Cell Stain ReadyProbes Hoechst 33342
    * 3 drops of NucGreen Dead 488 Cell Stain ReadyProbes Sytox Green
      * Vortexted mix for ~5 seconds, then stored in dark until ready to use.      Not performed       

  
E-125 flasks

  1. Collected E125s from shaker, wiped with ethanol-sprayed Rediwipe, and brought into BSC 
  2. Using a 25 mL serelogical pipette, gently pipette-mixed culture for 1 minute to break up cell clumps
  3. Pipette suspension though 70 um cell strainer into 3 x 50 mL tubes. Kept E125 vessels in BSC, as culture will be returned to this vessel after feed. 
  4. Centrifuged 50 mL tubes at 300 x g for 5 min.  15:19 - 15:24 
  5. Aspirated   100% (30 mL) of supernatant, taking extra care to not disrupt or aspirate pellet 
  6. Resuspended in 100 uL of medium
  7. Took 1 x 10 uL sample for haemocytometer cell count
    1. Cell count: 56,000
  8. Added  30 mL of fresh, warmed growth media
  9. Gently pipette-mixed cultures using serelogical, before moving cell suspension back to E125s
  10. Returned E125s to incubator. 15:35

### Staining Process for cell count - Not performed  

  1. ~~Added 100 uL samples from 6-WPs and E-flasks to staining buffer in 96WP and performed serial dilution by hand to achieve a 12.5% final dilution~~  performed by OT2 ~~  
~~

  2. Added culture IDs to plate map above
  3. Incubated culture in stain at RT in dark for 20 - 30 minutes  12:23 - 13:01 (Centrifuge was being used by production - kept missing window)
  4. Diluted to 12.5% in dPBS, then moved 100 uL to empty wells for imaging
  5. Centrifuged the 96-well plate at 650 RCF for 1 minute. Timestamp:       
  6. Took whole well micrographs using the Zaber microscope on blue & green fluorescence channels (DAPI & 488) 
    * Culture ID images were stored under:         

  7. Counted total cells (blue fluorescent nuclei, stained with Hoechst33342) and dead cells (green fluorescent nuclei, stained with Sytox green)
