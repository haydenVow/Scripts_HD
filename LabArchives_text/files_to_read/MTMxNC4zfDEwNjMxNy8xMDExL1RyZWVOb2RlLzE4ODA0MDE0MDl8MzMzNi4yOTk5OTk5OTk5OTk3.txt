RELATED TO MILESTONE:  This EPIC is progressing towards MS2: Generating 3x
DOLLY12 clonal fibroblasts cell lines which are adapted to suspension.

AIM/PURPOSE: The aim of this project is to generate at least one clonal
DOLLY12 fibroblast cell line growth in adherent culture by sorting single
isolated cells into 4x 384 well plates.

HYPOTHESIS: I hypothesise that more than one adherent clonal fibroblast
population will be generated from the initial 4x 384-well plate FACS sort and
SCC process.
