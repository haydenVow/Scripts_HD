Aim


To determine the density of low and medium MW pork bun gel.


Method


1\. Weigh out 2 x 50mL falcon tubes.

2\. Using a sterile spatula spoon in 10 mL of the pork bun gel into the tube.

3\. Centrifuge at 300g for 2 mins to remove air bubbles.

4\. Weigh final weight of pork bun gel.

5\. Determine density (g/mL).


Results


Low MW Alginate Pork Bun Gel

Tube mass: 12.876 g

Gel approx volume: ~ 8.75 mL

Tube + gel mass: 21.553 g

Gel mass / volume: 8.677 g

Density: 0.992 g/mL

  

Medium MW Alginate Pork Bun Gel

Tube mass: 12.658 g

Gel approx volume: ~ 7.5 mL

Tube + gel mass: 20.071 g

Gel mass / volume: 7.413 g

Density: 0.988 g/mL


Conclusion


The expected density was approximately around ~ 1.06 g/mL . There are some
possible reasons to explain this: The gel components have swollen leading to a
volume increase, while water has evaporated leading to a mass decrease. OR
Volume errors as we used flacon tubes to measure the volume.
