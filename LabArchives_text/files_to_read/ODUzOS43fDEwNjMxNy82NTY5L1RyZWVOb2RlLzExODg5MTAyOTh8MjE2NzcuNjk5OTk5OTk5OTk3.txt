Process:

1\. Aliquotted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then
placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath for a minimum of 20 minutes
prior to use:

  1.  Growth media (for seeding):   240 mL in  1 x 250 ml  tubes 
  2.  Time that all aliquot was placed in the water bath to warm before use:   9:35 am 

2\. Collected the cryovial from Liquid Nitrogen storage & place in foam
floater in water bath for 5 min  10 am

Location where cryovial was collected from:

 Homer  OR Dewer 1: Brew

Tower/Bucket # 2

Box/Cane # 6

Vial location: F2

Vial ID(s): 3681; 12418

  

THE BOX IN TOWER 2 ACTUALLY SAID TOWER 1 ON IT, SO IT WAS CONFUSING TO FIND
THESE VIALS. TO FIND THE OLD ID NUMBER IN RANGER, FILTER BY LEGACY ID  




3\. Ethanol sprayed & transferred the vial(s) to the BSC.

4\. Added  1 ml of Growth Media (to generate a total volume of 1mL in the
cryovial) to the cryovial, resuspended the cell suspension gently to reduce
osmotic shock.

5\. Collected the entire 1mL of cell suspension & transfer into the pre-warmed
15 ml tube of Growth Media (5mL).




6\. Using a 10mL serological pipette, resuspended & distributed 1 x vial
evenly in each of the  120 ml of pre-warmed Growth Media (prepared in Step 2
and each used to seed 4 x T175)

7\. Seeded cells into (non-gelatin coated) flasks/wells at approximately 15k
cells per cm2.

8\. Transfered   30 mL to each T175   flask/well.

9\. Transfered flask/plate(s) to incubate at: 10:47 Am
