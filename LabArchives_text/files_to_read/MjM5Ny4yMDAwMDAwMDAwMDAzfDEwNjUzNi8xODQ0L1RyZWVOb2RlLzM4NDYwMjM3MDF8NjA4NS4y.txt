Procedure

Passaging Suspension Cells - E-flasks

  1. Turn on the water bath and set temperature to 37째C.
  2. Retrieve a sample from each suspension flask in culture. See VSOP-082.
  3. Perform a cell count and record the total number of cells and the number of viable cells for each culture sampled.
    1. Cells are usually passaged when they reach a density of 800,000 to 1,000,000 cells/mL.
    2. Cells are passaged by diluting them in fresh 37째C warm medium.
  4. Place the aliquot(s) of growth media into a pre-warmed water bath and warm them in the water bath for at least 20 minutes before use.
  5. Transfer the growth media aliquot(s) and flask(s) required for passaging into the BSC, ensuring to wipe down containers with 70% EtOH during the transfer.
    1. Refer to Table A for the appropriate volumes of growth media for each E-flask type which will depend on the quantity of cells in the culture(s).
  6. Transfer the calculated cell suspension from the existing culture(s) to the required volume of fresh growth media
    1. If you are passaging into an E5000 flask or larger (i.e., 2L Biostat A or stirred tank reactor [200L/2000L]), seed a smaller E-flasks such as an E125 for parallel monitoring.
  7. Transfer the newly resuspended cell suspension into the required E-flask vessel(s).
  8. Transfer the newly seeded flasks to an incubator at 37째C, 5% CO2, and the recommended shaking speed for at least 2 minutes to evenly distribute the cells. See appendix A for required shaking speeds.
  9. Continue incubation at 37째C, 5% CO2 and the recommended RPM until the cells require a passage as outlined in step 3 of this VSOP.
