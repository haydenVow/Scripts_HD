How to use siphon

  1. Use according to suppliers instructions 
  2. strain liquid to remove clumps 
  3. pour liquid into siphon base - fill only to half capacity 
  4. screw gasket lined threated head of siphon onto the base 
  5. place nitrous oxide cartidge into the charger sleeve and screw this onto the threaded receptor on the siphons head. As you screw this charger sleeve into place so a hollow pin the centre of the receptor will pumcture the cartidge and you will hear te gas flow into the siphon under pressure  
  6.  Shake siphon six times to help gas dissolve into liquid (over shaking is detrimental) 
  7. place in fridge for at least 40 minutes prior yse to chill content and allow protein to react with gas. 
  8.  dispense by discharging the lever. The liquid under pressure from dissolved gas is forced out and expands into a foam
