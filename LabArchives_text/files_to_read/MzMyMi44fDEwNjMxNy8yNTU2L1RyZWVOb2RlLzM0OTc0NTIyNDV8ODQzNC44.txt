## Performed by:




Perform feed using below volumes (may be able to add more or less depending on
scaffold size):

96-well plate = at least 200ul per well

48-well plate with inserts = 1mL

24-well plate with inserts = 2ml  
  
NOTE - A high media volume is typically required per sample due to the high
cell seed densities used, and thus the high turn-over of media nutrients - it
is recommended that samples are cultured in wells larger than their size to
accommodate for excess media

Process:

1\. Aliquotted   mL  mL of  E6 Media into. Placed in water bath   : a/pm

2\. Removed   100 % of supernatant from vessel.

3\. Replaced with   mL (per well/per vessel) of     media.

4\. Returned vessel to incubate at:

  * [X]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (aviary cells)

  

  * Incubator (Thermo), Lab [Main]




### Observations/Summary:

 100 % media changed on vessel(s)
