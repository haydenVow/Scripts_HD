How much 10C to make:

  1. 100% feed = 1800 mL
  2. 50% feed = 900 mL
  3. Resuspension/count (harvest) = 30 mL
  4. Seeding = ~30 mL 
  5. D1 feed = 48 WPs - 64 ACF wells = 64 mL 
    * Total = 2824 mL - 850 mL (already made up)   

    * = 2 L (+270 mL 9C for Avani)

Process:

  1. Sterilised one car boy with 70% ethanol and transferred into the BSC 
  2. Poured __ mL of DMEM/F12 (1:1 ratio) into the car boy 
  3. Pipetted __ mL of DMEM/F12 (1:1 ratio) into a __ mL container (making a concentrated solution to then add to the DMEM/F12 in the carboy to make up to the correct concentrations) 
  4. Added the reagents for __ mL of E8_10C to the __ mL container of DMEM/F12
  5. Poured the ___ mL containing reagents into the car boy to create ___ mL of E8_10C
  6. Mixed thoroughly 
  7. Sterile filtered and added ___ mL lipids. Labelled and stored in fridge.
