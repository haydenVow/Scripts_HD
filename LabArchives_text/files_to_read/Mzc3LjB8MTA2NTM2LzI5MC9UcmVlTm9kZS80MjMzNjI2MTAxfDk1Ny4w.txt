Batch No:

EPIC Number: 23738  
Start date: 19/08/21  
End date: 15/09/21

### Batch goal(s)

Optimisation: Improve upon previous experimental findings and continue to find
new ways to increase batch yield in adherent cultures

  * To determine if VitC treatment at pre- or post-confluence is better
  * To see if we can we speed up the time till harvest by seeding higher (around 20kcells/cm2)
