  * 100 mL water 

  

  * Additional water for heating 
  * Additional water for filling specimen jar 
  * Scalpel 
  * 3 x 500 - 1L beaker
  * Stirrer 
  * Tweezer 
  * 27 x Specimen jars 
  * large bowl 
  * scales 
  * measuring cylinder 
  * sieve or colander 
  * 100 mm culture plate

  

  

Method to prepare samples:

  1. In a large bowl, combine  flour and water and knead 10 - 15 minutes until a smooth ball forms (it should spring back when you poke it )
  2. Repeat for  gluten and wheat + gluten samples
  3. For samples containing wheat flour, cover sample with cool water and leave to incubate at RT for 1 hours 
  4. Remove excess water and cover ball with fresh cold water 
  5. Knead in water to remove starch. When water is opaque and thickens, remove and replace with fresh water 
  6. repeat rinse until a spongey mass is obtained (dough should cling together well and water should be cloudy but not opaque)
  7.  squeeze out remaining water and allow seitan to rest in a colander to drain (20 - 30 minutes) 
  8. Weigh each sample
    1. Wheat flour: 
    2. What flour + gluten: 
    3. Gluten: 
  9. Separate into small 7g pieces 
  10.  ~~Divide seitan into 2 even pieces. further divide each piece into 9 pieces and form long strands.  ~~
  11.  ~~Braid strands, then pull to stretch and form a large knot. (this process will form fibers similar to pulled chicken)~~
    1. Otherwise if samples cannot be braided then Knead sampled into one another to form "fibers

  

Condition one: Heat in water at 80 degrees + autoclave

  1. Fill beakers half way with water (500 mL) and heat at least 4 samples of each at the following temperatures: 
    1. 80 degrees for 100 minutes - 16:55pm - 18:35pm
    2.  80 degrees for 130 minutes - 16:55pm - 17:05pm 
  2. Remove samples at given timepoints with a tweezer and transfer onto a 6 well plate
  3.  Allow to cool  (20 minutes), before cutting with a scalpel 
  4.  After observing samples, select suitable samples (cut into pieces if needed) to autoclave for use in cell culture 

Condition two: Autoclave

  1.  Place samples into autoclave bag and autoclave 
  2. After autoclaving, transfer into BSC and cut into desirable size for use as scaffold in cell culture

  

 ~~ ~~Condition Three: Dry heat  ~~~~

  1.  ~~  Place sample in suitable bag for heat sterilisation ~~
  2.  ~~  Treat samples at 220 degrees dry heat ~~
  3.  ~~  Allow samples to cool before transferring into the BSC ~~
  4.  ~~  Cut into desirable size for use as scaffold in cell culture~~

  

Observations

  * Wheat flour samples took longer to knead and form a smooth ball. The dough formed was soft yet elastic.
  * Wheat + Gluten samples formed a elastic dough that was semi soft and firm. still had a lot of starch left over - this could have resulted in the texture being softer than anticipated 
  * Gluten dough formed a lot better - was more stretchy and cohesive. formed an elastic dough. This is a result of having a higher gluten to water content.
