### Process:

1\. Took image of vessel with microscope on phase setting.

2. Aliquotted the required volume of each reagent in the table above:

  1. Growth media (for re-feed):  10  mL
  2. Growth media (for seeding):   20  mL 

Time that all aliquots were made and left at RT   15:56 pm




  1. Aspirated the supernatant from Culture 10812. Collected into 1 x 15mL tube. (total 7.5mL)  

  2. Replaced 10mL of media on original culture dish and placed culture back in incubator (100% feed). 15:40 pm  

  3. Collected 20uL of sample for a cell count on the hemocytometer.  

  4. Transferred the 7.5mL of supernatant into the 20mL aliquotted growth media (total volume 30mL).  

  5. Transferred the 30mL of cell suspension into 1 x E125 flask, and placed at 17C in the refrigerated incubator on a shaking platform at 100 RPM. 15:39 pm  

  

6\. Performed a cell count using the haemocytometer and recorded the cell
count data in the Google Doc spreadsheet: Cell Count Spreadsheet or cell count
widget below

  1. Total cell number was:   15M (unsure if all are live cells due to no trypan blue available)    




Observations/Summary:

Supernatant from culture 10812 appeared to be full of suspension cells and was
therefore moved into 30mL of Growth Media into 1 x E125 flask and put to shake
at 100 RPM in the refrigerated incubator.

  

A cell count landed at 15M particles (unsure if these are all truly cells as
they were various sizes, and unsure if they were all live due to no trypan
blue in yurt lab)
