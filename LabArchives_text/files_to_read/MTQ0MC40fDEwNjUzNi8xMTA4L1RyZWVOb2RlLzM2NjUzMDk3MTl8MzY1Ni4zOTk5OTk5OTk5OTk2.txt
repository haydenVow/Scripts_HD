50% Feed on 6xT75 containing 30 BioNOC II macrocarriers


# Procedure

# 50% Feed:  

  1. Turn on the water bath and set to 32'C.
  2. Aliquot required growth media into a sterile container/s and place into the water bath for at least 20 minutes.
  3. Once the media has reached the required temperature, transfer flasks to the BSC and remove required volume of media (see table below)
  4. Place the same volume of pre-warmed fresh media into each flask.
  5. Return the flasks to the incubators

Procedures for monitoring cell growth:

DAPI Staining: All (2) Flasks

* Images saved under 10748

ethanol accidently left on for 29min instead of 15min.

1. Take out 1 BioNOC from each (1) tube/flask using sterile forceps  
2\. Add 1mL 70% Ethanol to each well for 15 minutes  
3\. Remove ethanol and wash with dPBS  
4\. Add DAPI (1:1000) in dPBS for 5min  
5\. Remove all liquid and image

Results:

  * Cells are still visibly attached but it is hard to tell if they are growing
  * The 5,000cells/cm2 condition still looks like it has less cells than the other two groups

Dissociation and Cell Counting: All (1) Flasks

  1. 1x BioNOC was removed from each (1) flask in each seeing condition
  2. This was placed in a 15mL tube and 2mL of TrypLE was added at: 13:37
  3. The tubes were agitated twice during this incubation period, at: 13:44 and 13:49
  4. The TrypLE was removed at: 13:52 and placed in a clean 15mL tube
  5. Once TrypLE was removed the BioNOC carriers were washed twice with 1mL dPBS. Each time the tubes were flicked/shaken multiple times during the dPBS wash. 
  6. After each wash the dPBS was removed and added to the 15mL tube containing the TyrpLE
  7. Once all cell suspension was collected the 15mL centrifuge tubes were spun at 700rpm for 5 minutes. Timestamp: 14:07
  8. There was no visible pellet in the 15mL tubes so 3.75mL of supernatant was removed and the remaining solution (250uL) was used to re-suspend the pellet
  9. A 2 factor dilution was performed with Trypan Blue (20uL cell suspension in 20uL Trypan Blue) and the cells were counted on a heamocytometer.

Results:

* See results in widget below  

  * When comparing the recorded cells numbers to the expected cell numbers at various confluences, they are very inconsistent. 
  * It is not clear if this is because of the actual cell density, the loss of cells during the process having a large impact on the outcome because of the small amount of cells present on 1 carrier, OR the harvesting process itself being ineffective.

Expected Cells numbers assuming 50% confluent (20,000cells/cm2): 50,000cells

Cell Numbers per BioNOC carrier at seeding:

  * 5,000cells/cm2: 12,500 cells
  * 7500cells/cm2: 18,750 cells
  * 15000cells/cm2: 37,500 cells 

DAPI Staining: TrypLEd (1) Flasks

To test if the harvesting process was ineffective and whether or not cells
still remained on the carriers, I stained the TrypLEd carriers with DAPI. (Due
to a CHOMP feed, this wasn't done until an hour after the initial harvest,
during which time the carriers were contained an a tube with no liquid).

  1. Add 1mL 70% Ethanol to each well for 15 minutes
  2. Remove ethanol and wash with dPBS 
  3. Add DAPI (1:1000) in dPBS for 5min
  4. Remove all liquid and image

Results:

  * Some cells were still attached but the vast majority were effectively removed, therefore it is likely that the cells were lost during the process. 
  * Unusually, the 5000 group had the most cells still attached.
  * In future this type of procedure to be done on a minimum of 3 carriers.

Used Tryple ID A9758

# Procedure

# pH Check:

  1. The media removed from the flask during the 50% feed was placed into clean 50mL falcon tubes and a pH recording was performed on each one.
  2. Before use the pH probe was calibrated with the standard solutions (7.0pH and 4.0pH)
  3. Following calibration the pH probe was placed into each waste media tube 1 by 1, and rinsed with MilliQ between tubes. 
  4. The pH for each tube was listed in the table below

Seeding condition / Flask NumberpH  
5000 / 1 (10746)6.9  
5000 / 2 (10745)7.2  
7500 / 1 (10743)7.1  
7500 / 2 (10744)6.9  
15000 / 1 (10748)7.2  
15000 / 2 (10747)7.2
