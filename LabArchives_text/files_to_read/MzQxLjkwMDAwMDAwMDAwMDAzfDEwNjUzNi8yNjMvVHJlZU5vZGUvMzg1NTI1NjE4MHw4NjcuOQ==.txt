Batch No:

EPIC Number: 22611  
Start date: 02/08/21  
End date: 13/09/21

### Batch goal(s)

Optimisation: Improve upon previous experimental findings and continue to find
new ways to increase batch yield in adherent cultures

  * Seed cells in TGFb
  * See how cells respond (peel/aggregate/stay adhered) to numerous treatment conditions in roller bottles: 
    * VitC alone @24hrs
    * VitC + TGFb @24hrs
    * Seeded with TGFb and treated with VitC @48hrs
    * Seeded with TGFb and treated with VitC @96hrs

  * Co-culture MUSC and Fibroblasts in roller bottles
  * Replicate the high yield observed with VitC treatment in Batch 15 (1.5g)
  * Test a different combination of TGFb and VitC treatment in multi-layed flasks
