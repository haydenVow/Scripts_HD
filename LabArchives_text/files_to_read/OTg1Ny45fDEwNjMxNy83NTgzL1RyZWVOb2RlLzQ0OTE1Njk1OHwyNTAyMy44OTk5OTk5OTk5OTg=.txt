Process:

 1\. Aliquotted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and
then placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath for a minimum of 20 minutes
prior to use:

  1.  TrypLE:  400mL in 500mL container 
  2.  dPBS (for neutralising)   800 mL in 1L container 
  3.  Growth media (for pellet resuspension):   40mL in | 70mL yellow lid container | tubes 
  4.  Time that all aliquots were placed in the water bath to warm before use:   11 :30 

Note: if aliquots were placed in water bath at different times, record the
time stamp for each individual solution.




2\. Washed the flask(s) with dPBS.

3\. Added | 200 |mL tryple to each vessel/well and incubated at 37ºC for
|12:25 - 12:41 | min

4\. Neutralised with | 200 | dPBS (warmed) and combined cell suspension into
2x and 2x 50mL flacon tubes| 250mL | tube.

5\. Centrifuged at 650 x g for 5 min

  1.  Start/Finish time for centrifugation was:   13:15 - 13:20 a/pm   




6\. Aspirated the supernatant(s).

7\. Resuspend pellet(s) in |110 |mL |growth  | media.

8\. Performed a cell count using the haemocytometer and recorded the cell
count data in the Google Doc spreadsheet called 'Cell Count Spreadsheet' (see
link below):

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1DPzKubYxfHmWogVPihC-
SSIBtIylyrBQE5kRX5Z8NtI/edit#gid=0

9\. Total cell number was: |538,000,000|

10\. Calculate the required volume cell suspension & freeze medium to generate
a concentration of ~1M cells/mL.




11\. Prepared 40mL Freeze Medium: (FBS + 10% DMSO).

Stored at 4ºC until use to keep chilled.

Whilst centrifuge is spinning, prepared & printed vial labels, labelled
cryovials. (Note that passage number will be the same as the culture you
harvest from. The passage number will increase by 1 during the revive of a
vial.)




Since we have 5.3M per mL, Aliquot 15.5mL of cell suspension, to bank 82.15M
cells.

Centrifuge down the 15.5mL of cells at 650g for 650g for 5minutes 15:57 -
15:03

13\. Aspirated supernatant carefully, taking care not to disturb the pellet.

14\. Resuspended the pellet in |40|mL freeze media (chilled, to reduce DMSO
toxicity).  
(FBS+10%DMSO= 36mL FBS+4mL DMSO)

15\. Aliquotted | 1000 |µL into | 40 | x cryovials (already labelled). (2M
CELL PER VIAL)

16\. Tightened the lids & transfer the cryovials to a Mr. Frosty immediately
into the -80ºC freezer.  14:20

17\. Allow the cells to freeze for at least 18-24 hours before transferring to
Liquid Nitrogen storage.
