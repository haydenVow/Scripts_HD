1\. Launch Morsel as saleable product in Singapore

AIM/PURPOSE: Test the presence of growth factors in cellular product at end-
stage to demonstrate comparable levels to meat product

HYPOTHESIS: Growth factor presence within cellular product will be comparable
or less than concentrations found within meat product

RESULTS SUMMARY:

  * EGF and IGF were present at a significantly higher concentration in Morsel samples when compared to conventional quail meat
  * EGF concentration was not significantly different between cooked Morsel sample and conventional quail meat
  * IGF-1 concentration was significantly different between cooked Morsel sample and conventional quail meat

CONCLUSIONS:

  * concentrations of IGF-1 and EGF were assayed by ELISA in Morsel samples, cooked Morsel, and conventional chicken and quail meats
  * ELISA kit detected 3-4x greater concentration of growth factors in Morsel compared to conventional quail meat
  * it is currently an open question whether the specific values measured are truely reflective of absolute concentrations
  * data show that rinsing cells in PBS before harvesting and storing is not necessary to remove potentially 'contaminating' residual media potentially containing growth factors which may skew results
  * an acceptable concentration of growth factor in food products is not defined. It may be possible that the levels of growth factor concentrations in Morsel are acceptable, even if increased compared to conventional quail

NEXT STEPS:

  * determine the acceptable and safe concentrations for EGF and IGF-1 in food products, and determine if concentrations measured here are acceptable
  * compare standard curve from kit to standard curve of known concentrations of EGF and IGF-1 variants used in manufacturing and Morsel production if this assay is repeated to confirm the accuracy of the kit in measuring these specific growth factor variants 
  * G-sheet here defines suggested plate layout and samples for new run
