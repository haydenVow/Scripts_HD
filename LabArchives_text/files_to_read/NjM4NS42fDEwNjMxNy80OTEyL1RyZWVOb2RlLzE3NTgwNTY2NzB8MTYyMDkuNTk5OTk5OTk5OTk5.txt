Media/Reagents used:

E6 + 1x P/SM77438 ml  
2 % HS + 1x P/SM77408 ml  
  
  
  
  
  




Process:

  1. Aliquotted  8 mL mL of  E6 Media 
  2. Aliquotted  8 mL mL of  2% HS Media
  3. Placed in water bath  11:15 am - 12:06 pm
  4. Replaced  100 % (200uL) of E6 supernatant from vessel. (column 6)
    1. Remove warm E6 media from the water bath, and transfer into 1 x sterile 70mL pot.
    2. Aspirate from wells A6-D6 (vertically).
    3. Change tips.
    4. Add 200uL warm E6 media to wells A6-D6 immediately.
    5. Aspirate from wells E6-H6 (vertically).
    6. Change tips.
    7. Add 200uL warm E6 media to wells E6-H6 immediately.
    8. Repeat for column 6 in all plates.
    9. In those plates containing a third column with cells, do not feed the third column, only feed columns 6 and 7.
  5.  Replaced  100 % (200uL) of 2% HS supernatant from vessel. (column 7)
    1. Once E6 feeds are complete, remove warm 2% HS media from the water bath, and transfer into 1 x sterile 70mL pot.
    2. Aspirate from wells A7-D7 (vertically).
    3. Change tips.
    4. Add 200uL warm 2% HS media to wells A7-D7 immediately.
    5. Aspirate from wells E7-H7 (vertically).
    6. Change tips.
    7. Add 200uL warm 2% HS media to wells E7-H7 immediately.
    8. Repeat for column 7 in all plates.
    9. In those plates containing a third column with cells, do not feed the third column, only feed columns 6 and 7.
  6. Returned vessel to incubate at:   12:27 pm 

  * [ X]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (aviary cells)

### Observations/Summary:

 100 % media changed on vessel(s)

Plate ID 8670 (C2C12): Cells in E6 media are beginning to peel off in some
wells. Myotubes are short and not very organised. There are also black
clusters distributed around the surface area of the wells in all wells. In the
same plate on the 2% HS wells there are long and more organised myotubes.
There is some death as well, especially in well H7.

Plate ID 8661 (Daisy4): Cells in both E6 and 2% HS do not look too well. There
is barely any myotube formation and wells do not look too confluent.

Plate ID 8658 (DOLLY12): Cells in E6 are forming more as well as longer
myotubes than those in 2% HS.
