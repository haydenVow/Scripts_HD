Process:

Prepare additional 19x 384 well plates (non-tissue culture treated, with black
walls) with Anti-adherent rinsing solution to prevent cellular attachment
(Plates 2-20)  
*Perform process in non-tissue culture treated 384 plates  
  
  
NOTE: For all cell types, Anti-Adherence Rinsing Solution is required during
plate preparation steps to ensure optimal performance. Anti-Adherence Rinsing
Solution prevents cell adhesion and promotes efficient EB and spheroid
formation.  
  
  
1. Warm basal medium (i.e. RPMI, CD-CHO, Hycell, etc) and complete medium (RPMI + FBS/KSR/PS etc).  
  
2. Pre-treat 384 wells with Anti-Adherence Rinsing Solution as described below.  
a. Add Anti-Adherence Rinsing Solution to each well to be used, as follows:  
• 384-well plate: 20 µL  
• 24-well plate: 500 µL  
• 6-well plate: 2 mL  
b. Centrifuge plate at 1300 x g for 5 minutes in a swinging bucket rotor
fitted with plate holders. NOTE: Plates must be well balanced. Prepare a
balance plate using a standard plate filled with water to match the weight and
position of the plate.  
c. Observe plate under a microscope to ensure that bubbles have been removed
from microwells. If bubbles remain trapped in any microwells, centrifuge at
1300 x g for an additional 5 minutes.  
d. Aspirate Anti-Adherence Rinsing Solution from the wells.  
  
3. Rinse each well with warm basal medium, as follows:  
• 384-wellplate: 50 µL  
• 24-wellplate: 2 mL  
• 6-wellplate: 5 mL  
  
4. Aspirate medium from the well.  
  
5. Add warm complete medium to each well to be used, as follows:  
• 384-wellplate: 50 µL  
• 24-wellplate: 1 mL  
• 6-wellplate: 2.5 m
