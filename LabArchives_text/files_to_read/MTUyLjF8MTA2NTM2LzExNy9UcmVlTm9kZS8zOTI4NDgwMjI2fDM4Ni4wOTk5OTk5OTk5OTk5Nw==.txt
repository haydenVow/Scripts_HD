Batch Overview

Batch Weight

13 x 10CF harvested  
Total = 30.2g (provided to food team as 1 x 15.2g pellet unwashed and 1 x
14.8g pellet washed with tap water)

  

Achievements

  * Biggest cell weight yield yet
  * used only 250mL tubes for the final harvest (and reused in spins) - quickest time 4.5 hrs to harvest 13 x 10CF
  * Also used strippette to suck out settled aggregates from bottles instead of using suction line to removed supernatant - this was a significant time saver and made it easier to deal with the liquid waste. 
  * even with half TGF-b1 treatment, aggregates formed in each layer but were more adhered to the surface as a sheet structure than previously observed with the usual treatment concentration. 

Deviations

  * only half concentration of TGF-b1 used for treatment due to low stock (treatment concentration: 5 ng/mL)

Notes on Batch 12 8x5CF Harvest (Passage 4):  
Tryple process- 10:20-10:44 ; Total = 24 minutes  
Centrifugation - 10:53-11:31; Total =38 minutes  
Resuspension - 11:31-12:00; Total = 29 minutes (Vaccuum pump broke down in
between)  
Cell Count : 12:00-12:40; 40 minutes (4xcell counts)  
Cell Seed: 12:50-13:16pm(+20 minutes due to error); Total = 26 minutesOverall
time taken = 177 minutes (~3 hrs)Changes made to this batch:

  * 3 operators occupying BSC space (Harvesting 3xflasks at a time)
  * 250mL tubes

Observation:

  * Reduced harvest time by ~2 hours. Batch 11 harvest= 315minutes (~5hrs,15 mins) for overall time taken.
  * Almost doubled cell yield. 1.5 billion cells.  Batch 11 harvest = 860k cells (need to repeat process of using 250mL tubes to determine whether this improved cell yield due to less surface area exposure)
