### Process:

1\. Took images of vessels with microscope on phase setting.

2\. Aliquotted the required volume of each reagent then placed all aliquots to
warm in the water bath for a minimum of 20 minutes prior to use:

  1. TrypLE:    10   mL in    1 x 15 mL   tube
  2.  dPBS (for washing and neutralising):     20   mL in   1 x 50 mL   tube
  3. Growth media (for pellet resuspension):    0.5   mL each media in    3 x 15 mL   tubes
  4. Growth media (for seeding):    5.5   mL each media in    3 x 15 mL   tubes

Time that all aliquots were placed in the water bath the warm before use
11:50  

Note: if aliquots were placed in water bath at different time, record the time
stamp for each individual solution.




4\. Removed vessel(s) from the incubator   12:07  

5\. Washed the vessel(s) with dPBS (warmed).

6\. Added    3   mL tryple to each vessel/well and incubated at 37˚C.

  1. Start/Finish for TrypLE was (checked at 10 min, wasn't quite ready)    12:13 -  12:30    

7\. Neutralised with    3 mL    dPBS and combined cell suspensions into    3 x
15 mL   tubes

8\. Centrifuged at 650 x g for 5 min.

  1. Start/Finish time for centrifugation was      12:37  \-   12:42    




9\. Aspirated the supernatant(s).

10\. Resuspended pellet(s) in     3 x 0.5    mL     respective growth
media     12:43  

11\. Aliquoted   3 x 10 uL   of resuspended cells into a microcentrifuge tube
for cell count.

12\. Performed a cell count using the haemocytometer and recorded the cell
count data in the Google Doc spreadsheet called 'Cell Count Spreadsheet' (see
link below):

  1.  Total cell number was: 
    1. commercial media: 
    2. in-house (1/2): 
    3. in-house (2/2):   

  2. Volume of cell suspension required for subculture was:  
    1. Prepare 175 000 cells in 5mL for each condition for seeding T25 flasks with 7000 cells/cm^2:
      1. commercial media:    425 uL    
      2. in-house (1/2):     405 uL    
      3. in-house (2/2):     500  uL (using entire suspension - only 144000 cells)     

  3. Cell density per vessel:     7000 cells/cm^2    




13\. Transferred the 5mL cell suspensions into 1x T25 flask for each condition
13:08      .

14\. Seeded 3x 96 well plates using the 3.5mL cell suspensions prepared above
by transferring 140uL/well. Note: the edge wells of the 96 well plate are not
used and contain PBS only. Cells were seeded as follows for each 96 wp:

  1. column 2: fibroblasts in commercial media 
  2. column 3: fibroblasts in in-house media (1/2) 
  3. column 4: fibroblasts in in-house media (2/2)

16\. Transferred vessel(s) to incubate at:      13:12  

  * [X]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (avian cells)

Observations/Summary:

Fibroblasts passaged from 3 x T25 flasks into a new set of 3 x T25 flasks for
continuous culture

\- observationally appeared to be more floating dead cells in in-house media
2/2 than the other conditions (on looking in microscope before passage)
