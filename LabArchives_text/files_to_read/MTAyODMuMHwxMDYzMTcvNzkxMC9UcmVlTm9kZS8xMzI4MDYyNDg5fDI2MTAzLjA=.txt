Cell Count:

  1. Sampled 1mL per flask for trypan blue staining & counting
  2. For manual counting, pipetted 20uL suspension and diluted with an equal volume of trypan blue for 1:2 dilution and performed cell count (manual)
  3. Sampled 200ul from 1mL aliquot in eppendorf tube. Placed Nucelocounter cassette in tube and depressed cassette 
  4. Counts:
    * 12007: 
      * Manual count: 920 000 cells/mL
      * Nucleocounter count: 862 000 cells/mL (92.1% viability, 21.4um diameter, 3.9% aggregation)
    * 12008:  
      * Manual count: 710 000 cell/mL
      * Nucleocounter count: 728 000 cell/mL (91.3% viability, 21.9um diameter, 7.2% aggregation)  




Process:

  1. Freestyle Nuvonis medium was placed in bead bath at ~12pm and pre-warmed for ~3 hours
  2. Prepared 266mL Freestyle Nuvonis medium and supplemented with growth factors (1:1000 IGF, 1:5000 EGF for 20ng/mL final concentration, each)
  3. Removed flasks from incubator at 3:30pm and brought into BSC
  4. Used serelogical pipette to move entire volume of cell suspension into single flask
  5. Added 133mL newly prepared media into each new E500 (x2)
  6. Added 30mL cell suspension to each flask for a new approximate cell density of 150 000 cells/mL
  7. Returned flasks to incubation 37degC 120RPM at 3:45pm
