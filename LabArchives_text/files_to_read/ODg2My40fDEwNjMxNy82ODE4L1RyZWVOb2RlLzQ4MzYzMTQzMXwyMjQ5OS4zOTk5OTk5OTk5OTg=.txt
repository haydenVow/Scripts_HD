Prepare materials for thaw and seed:

2\. Aliquotted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then
placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath for 15-20 minutes prior to use
(May need to be left to warm for longer given the bead bath takes longer to
warm up reagents/ growth mediums).

  *   Growth media (for seeding):    120mL 
  * Growth media (for resuspending):    3mL 
  * Time that aliquot was placed in the water bath to warm before use:    15:07   

  




## Thaw and seed vial:

3\. Collected the cryovial from Liquid Nitrogen storage & place in foam
floater in water bath for 5 min 15 :25 -  15:30  

Location where cryovial was collected from:

Vial details:  2   cryovials at   2,000,000 cells each for a total of
4,000,000  cells

`4. Ethanol sprayed & transferred the vial(s) to the BSC.`

`5.  Added  1000µL of Growth Media (to generate a total volume of 2mL in the
cryovial) to the cryovial, resuspended the cell suspension gently to reduce
osmotic shock. `

`6. Collected the entire 2mL of cell suspension & transfer into the pre-warmed
tube of Growth Media. `

`7. Using a 10mL serological pipette, resuspended & distributed the cells
evenly in the 120mL`` ``of pre-warmed Growth Media (prepared in Step 2). `

8`. Transfered flask/plate(s) to incubate at: `15:50``

  * [X]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells) in the library lab
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (aviary cells)

  

Making labels

Note - You will need to increase the passage number by one. (i.e. if your
thawed vial ID has a passage number of 3, when you make a culture ID for you
vessel you will need change the passage number to 4 on Airtable.)

Summary:

2x cryovials of 2 million cells (4 million cells total) per vial were thawed
and seeded into 4x T175s with D/F+20%FBS+1xP/S growth medium. This is to
initiate the expansion of the Objective 3 Alpaca Bone Marrow for prototype
taste testing.
