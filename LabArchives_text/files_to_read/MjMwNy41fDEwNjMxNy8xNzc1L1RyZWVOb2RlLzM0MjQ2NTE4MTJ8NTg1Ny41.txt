Process:

1\. Aliquotted   30 mL  mL of  Growth Media into   70 mL   sterile container.
Placed in water bath   14:55 pm

2\. Using a multichannel pipette, removed   100 % of supernatant from vessel.

3\. Using a multichannel pipette with four tips attached, replaced with  140
uL  (per well) of  growth   media. (Four tips can fit into the 70 mL sterile
container)

4\. Returned vessel to incubate at:

  * [x]  37ÂºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * Incubator (# Thermo ), Lab [Main]
