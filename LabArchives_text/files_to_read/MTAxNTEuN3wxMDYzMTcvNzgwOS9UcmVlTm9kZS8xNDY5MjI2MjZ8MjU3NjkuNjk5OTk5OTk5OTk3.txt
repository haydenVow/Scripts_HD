Process:

  1. Placed the  170 mL aliquot of  Growth Media in the bead bath set at 37 C for 20 minutes or until warm to the touch ( I performed the continuous culture feed as well as the SCC feed with the same growth media).
  2. Removed  15 mL (50%) supernatant from each vessel (please change tips).
  3. Replaced with 15 mL of growth media per well/per vessel  (please change tips to feed each T175).
  4. Returned vessel to incubate at: 15:19 pm
