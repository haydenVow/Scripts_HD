CHOMP8 Isolation was performed via collagenase and digestion of tissue at 37C
and isolate was cultured at 37C w/ 5% CO2 in DMEM/F12 + 20% FBS + P/S  
Results  
A small adherent population was observed after 8 days in culture however had a
'fried egg' morphology which is typical of senescent cells. They also did not
appear to be proliferating in culture. This culture was therefore terminated
after 13 days in culture.

CHOMP09 Isolation performed via collagenase and digestion of tissue at 30C and
isolate was cultured under the following conditions. .  
A. Cultured at 37C w/ 5% CO2 in DMEM/F12 + 20% FBS + P/S  
B. Cultured at 30C w/ 5% CO2 in DMEM/F12 + 20% FBS + P/S  
C. Cultured at 30C w/ 5% CO2 in M199 + 20% FBS + P/S  
Results  
No adherent cell population was established for culture A which was discarded
after 10 days in culture.  
Adherent cells appeared in culture B from day 6 (Figure 1) and were
successfully expanded to an MCB of 13M cells (Table 1). Their mean doubling
time was 2.87 days (Table 3)  
Adherent cells appeared in culture C from day 7 (Figure 1). They were passaged
3 times before being discarded on day 40 due to their slow doubling time,
which had a mean of 5.6 days (Table 3)  
  
CHOMP 07 Isolation performed via trypsin digestion of tissue at 30C and
isolate was cultured under the following conditions. .  
A. Cultured at 37C w/ 5% CO2 in [DMEM/F12 + 20% FBS + P/S]  
B. Cultured at 30C w/ 5% CO2 in [DMEM/F12 + 20% FBS + P/S]  
C. Cultured at 30C w/ 5% CO2 in [M199 + 20% FBS + P/S]  
Results  
No adherent cell population was established for culture A which was discarded
after 10 days in culture  
Adherent cells appeared in culture B from day 6 (Figure 1) and were
successfully expanded to an MCB of 12.5M cells (Table 1).Their mean doubling
time was 2.28 days  (Table 3)  
Adherent cells appeared in culture C from day 6 (Figure 1). They were passaged
once before being discarded on day 36 after undergoing a single passage only
due to slow growth rate (Table 2)  

CHOMP06 (Outgrowth) Tissue was macerated and cultured under the following
conditions.  
A. Cultured at 37C w/ 5% CO2 in DMEM/F12 + 20% FBS + P/S  
B. Cultured at 30C w/ 5% CO2 in DMEM/F12 + 20% FBS + P/S  
Results: No adherent cell population was established for either A or B, which
were terminated after 27 days.  
  




Summary of Results

  1. Adherent cell populations were established via the isolation of cells following a collagenase + dispase digestion protocol performed at both 30°C and 37°C. 
  2. Adherent cell populations were established via the isolation of cells following a trypsin digestion protocol performed at 30°C.
  3. Were were unable to establish a plastic adherent population of cells from outgrowth culture of macerated muscle tissue. 
  4. Plastic adherent CHOMP cells showed a greater rate of proliferation when cultured at 30°C compared to at 37°C. 
  5. Plastic adherent CHOMP cells showed a greater rate of proliferation when cultured in DMEM/F12 + 20% FBS + 1x P/S compared to those cultures in M199 \+ 20% FBS + 1x P/S.
  6. 2 CHOMP cell lines were expanded to MCBs and subsequently to WCBs. These were CHOMP07 (trypsin digested at 30°C + cultured in DMEM/F12 +20% FBS + 1x P/S) and CHOMP09 (collagenase + dispase digested at 30°C + cultured in DMEM/F12 +20% FBS + 1x P/S).
