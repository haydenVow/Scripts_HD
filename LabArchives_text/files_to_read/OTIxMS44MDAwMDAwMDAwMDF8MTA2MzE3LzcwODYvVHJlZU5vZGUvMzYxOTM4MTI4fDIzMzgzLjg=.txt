## Flask observations:

All flasks observed had mixed confluence levels on their surface ranging
between 30% and 50% confluence in a zonal pattern. Some flasks appeared to
have slightly more cells than others but all were below what we would expect
in terms of overall confluence at this stage (expected to be at ~70%
yesterday).

I also found that the incubator that the cells were growing in had a dry water
pan - so I added 750 mL autoclaved water with CuSO4.

## Next steps:

Given the length of time they have been in culture, a 50% media change is
likely necessary to ensure the continued growth and health of the cells. They
may reach their confluence target of ~70% tomorrow if this is done and we can
further proceed with the experiment with a ~2 day shift in the original plans
for these cells (compared to the CHOMP_07 fibroblasts that are the other half
of this experiment).
