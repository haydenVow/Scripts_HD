Process:

 1\. Aliquotted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and
then placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath for a minimum of 20 minutes
prior to use:

  1.  TrypLE:  40 mL in 1 x 120 ml urine pot 
  2.  dPBS (for neutralising)  40 ml  in 1 x 120 ml urine pot
  3. Growth media: 120 ml for reseeding
  4.  Time that all aliquots were placed in the water bath to warm before use:  10:20 - 10:40 am 

Note: if aliquots were placed in water bath at different times, record the
time stamp for each individual solution.




2\. Washed the flask(s) with dPBS.

3\. Added 10mL tryple to each vessel/well and incubated at 30ºC for 8 min

4\. Neutralised with 10 ml dPBS (warmed) and combined cell suspension into 4 x
50 ml tube.

5\. Centrifuged at 400 x g for 5 min  




14\. Aspirated supernatant carefully, taking care not to disturb the pellet.

15\. Resuspended the pellet in 1 mL freeze media (chilled, to reduce DMSO
toxicity).

16\. Aliquotted 1 mL into each cryovial (already labelled).

17\. Tightened the lids & transfer the cryovials to a Mr. Frosty immediately
into the -80ºC freezer.   12:35 pm

18\. Allow the cells to freeze for at least 18-24 hours before transferring to
Liquid Nitrogen storage.
