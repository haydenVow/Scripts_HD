Figure 1: Comparison of picking times for both suspension and adherent multi-
well protocols. Picking times were generated by testing the time taken for the
Opentrons to pick 25%, 50%, or 100% of the harvested plate (i.e., 96 clones
[25% of 384] for the 384>96, 48 clones [50% of 96] for the 96>24, 24 clones
[100% of 24] for the 24>6). S = suspension, A = adherent.
