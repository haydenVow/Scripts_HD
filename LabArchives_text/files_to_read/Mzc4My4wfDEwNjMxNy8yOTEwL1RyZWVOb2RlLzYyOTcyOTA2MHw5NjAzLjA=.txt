RELATED TO MILESTONE:   Non KR related.

AIM/PURPOSE: To expand the plastic adherent population of our CHOMP01 isolate
to generate a working cell bank of CHOMP01 fibroblast-like cells.

HYPOTHESIS:  When cultured at 28Â°C CHOMP01 cells will proliferate in M199 \+
15% FBS + 1x PS + 20ng/mL EGF  media, allowing us to bank >8M cells as a MCB
within 3 weeks.

RESULTS SUMMARY: Cultures were terminated after 14 days in culture, as no
adherent population was established in this time.  

CONCLUSIONS: The hypothesis was not supported as we did not see the emergence
of an adherent cell population. It is unclear if this was due to shortcomings
in our cell isolation process or because the culture conditions were not
suitable for crocodile cells. This biopsy and isolation was performed
following Vows protocols which were originally developed for mammalian cells.
Our findings suggest that  these protocols are not suitable for the isolation
and culture of reptilian primary cells.

NEXT STEPS: A literature review should be performed to look into successful
protocols for the isolation and culture of crocodile, or other reptilian
fibroblasts. Once we have a better understanding of the optimal conditions for
reptilian cells, another crocodile should be sourced, and the biopsy and
isolation should be attempted again.
