RELATED TO OKR: KR1: Determine feasibility of culturing FCHOMP-09 cells as
encapsulated aggregates in suspension culture format

AIM/PURPOSE: The focus of this KR is to determine if encapsulated aggregate
culture is compatible with FCHOMP-09 cells, including maintenance, expansion,
and cell viability.

HYPOTHESIS:  

This project aims to de-risk the assumption that CHOMP fibroblasts, which are
the preferred cell line for GEN1 product and were isolated in-house, are
capable of expansion in a single-cell suspension culture format. Primary, non-
transformed and non-immortalised fibroblasts are inherently an anchorage-
dependent cell type and thus 'adaptation to suspension culture' is unlikely to
occur through media formulation optimisation alone.

RESULTS SUMMARY:

  * Encapsulation methods tested
    * alginate + fibrin
    * alginate + collagen I
    * alginate + Matrigel
    * alginate + CHOMP ECM precipitate (prepared by James Henstock by TCA precipitation/pulldown)
  * cell spreading was not achieved to a desirable level (by eye - determined by staining for F-actin with phalloidin)
  * cells were viable in functionalised alginate hydrogels

CONCLUSIONS: the amount of time dedicated to optimising conditions was
determined to be unreasonable for GEN1 product launch timelines (R&D to be
finalised by end of March)

NEXT STEPS: findings have been handed over to relevant cell-encapsulation
teams to streamline work processes and accelerate other work-streams
