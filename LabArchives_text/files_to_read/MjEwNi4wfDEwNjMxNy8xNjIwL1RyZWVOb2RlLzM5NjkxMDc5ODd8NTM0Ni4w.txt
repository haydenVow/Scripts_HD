Process:

1\. Removed plate from fridge (incubated in primary antibodies overnight).

2\. Washed 3 times with 200uL of PBS at RT.

15:27 pm

15:30 pm

15:32 pm

3\. Added 75uL of secondary HRP antibody mixtures (refer to plate map) to each
well.

4\. Incubated the cells with secondary HRP antibody mixtures overnight at 4
degrees.  16:04 - Overnight a/pm

NOTE: from this step onwards protect from the light by wrapping plates in foil
and perform experiment in the dark.




ELISA protocol:

*Plate was frozen when taken out of the fridge (17/06) placed in Thermo incubator to thaw.

5mL of TMB substrate solution (#S1862) and 5mL of 0.5M HCl stop solution
(#M5491) was aliquotted separately.

1\.  Removed 2nd antibody solution.  09:45 a/pm

2\.  Washed with PBS 4 times for 5 minutes:

 09:55 - 10:00 a/pm

 10:02 - 10:10 a/pm

 10:13: - 10:20 a/pm

 10:23 a/pm

PBS was removed and plate was blotted onto 2x layered rediwipes to ensure all
PBS has been removed.

3\.  Added 75uL of TMB substrate solution to each well of the 96 well plates
(4.8mL total) and incubated for 15 mins in the dark (used stopwatch to
precisely monitor time).

 11:04 - 11:19 a/pm

Observation: TMB solution is clear and upon addition of solution to each well
after a few seconds, colour changed from clear to blue.

  

4\.  Added stop solution (0.5M HCl) in an equal volume (75uL) to each well at
the end of 15 mins incubation period. Make observation on colour change and
take picture if possible.

11:19 a/pm

5\. Immediately removed 100uL of supernatant from each well after pipette
mixing and transferred to a new non-treated 96 well plate.

6\. Read absorbance at 450nm on the NanoStar microplate reader.

  




Janus Green protocol:

6\. Wash original plate 3x with 200uL of PBS:

 11:49 a/pm

 11:53 a/pm

Observation: It seems cells adhered at the bottom of the wells are retaining a
purple hue despite supernatant colour changing from yellow to clear as a
result of multiple PBS washes.

 11:59 a/pm

1\. Aspirated PBS from each well and added 100uL of 1X Janus Green (0.3% w/v
in PBS) (#M4399) per well.

2\. Incubated plate at RT for 5 minutes.

 13:30 -13:35 a/pm.

  

3\. Removed dye and washed 5 times with 200uL of deionised water.

4\. Removed last water wash and added 200uL of 0.5M HCl.

5\. Incubated plate at RT for 10 minutes.

13:51 - 14:01 a/pm

6\. Transferred 100uL of the supernatant after pipette mixing into a new
untreated 96 well plate.

Observation: Visual inspection shows that Column 3 has no cells as expected

7\. Read absorbance on the NanoStar plate reader at 605 nm.

Observations/Summary:

See individual entries for observations.

Summary: ELISA pipeline tested for the first time. Secondary stained with HRP
conjugated antibody at different concentrations (with fluorescent control)
then peroxidase reaction was performed and colourmetric measure was observed
using plate reader. Janus Green protocol was performed on same plate to
quantify cell concentration per well.
