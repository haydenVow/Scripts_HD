Process:

Aliquoted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then
placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath > 30 minutes prior to use

  1. Observed cultures under the microscope and recorded confluence in the table above. 
  2. Imaged cultures on 10x magnification (captured in Mia)
  3. TrypLE:     400 mL 
  4. dPBS (for washing & neutralising)   1000 mL
  5. Growth media (for seeding):   30 mL for each
  6. Removed spent media.
  7. Washed the flask(s) with dPBS. Repeat to remove KSR.
  8. Added  150 and 250  mL tryple to each vessel/well and incubated at 37˚C for  30 minutes   
  9. Neutralised with   150 and 250  mL dPBS to each vessel (warmed) and combined cell suspension into two 500  mL tubes.
  10. Centrifuged at 650 x g for 5 min.
  11. Aspirated + discarded supernatant
  12. Resuspended pellet(s) in  30  mL media.
  13. Strained cell suspension to make a single cell suspension.   
Performed a cell count using the hemocytometer and recorded the cell count
data in widget or the Google Doc spreadsheet called 'Cell Count Spreadsheet'
(see link below):

  14. Total cell number was:  49,800,000 cells

  15. 6.4 mL was separated into another 50 mL tube for cryopreservation. 

  16. Centrifuged at 650 x g for 5 min.
  17. Re-seeded cells as per table above.

  18. Transferred flasks to incubate at 37ºC, 5% CO2, library lab incubator #77.

  

For Cryopreservation:

17\.  Aspirated supernatant and resuspended cell pellet in 10 mL cryostor.

10\. Dispensed 1 mL of cell suspension into each cryovial to freeze down at 1M
cells/mL.
