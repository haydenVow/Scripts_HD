All flasks were discarded as all ACF conditions seemed to be performing
poorly. This was evident from the low cell counts seen on the passage on 31st
May. After the passage, there were many more cells visible in the flask with
E810C compared with flasks with other ACF conditions.

Images taken on 5x, Phase are attached below:

In order, images correspond to:

  * 'serum' = DMEM/F12 + 20% FBS + 1x P/S + 10uM p38i
  * E810C
  * E810C no GABA
  * E810C + extra ethanolamine and p38i
  * E810C + extra ethanolamine and p38i, no EGF, GABA, LIF
