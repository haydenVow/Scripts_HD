## 1\. Background

The IGFs are mitogenic, polypeptide growth factors that stimulate the
proliferation and survival of various cell types, including muscle, bone, and
cartilage tissue in vitro. Specifically engineered for higher biological
potency in vitro, IGF-I LR3 has an increased half-life and a binding aversion
to native proteins within the body that make it ideal for both research and
large-scale culturing.

## 3\. Safety

The preparation of IGF-1-LR3 aliquots is to be performed in a Biological
Safety Cabinet. General lab PPE is required, including face mask, hair net,
gloves, and lab coat.

## 6a. Method/Procedure (suitable for Mesokine CAT# MK0301)

Note: Please perform this procedure with the BSC light turned off. Growth
factors are often sensitive to light exposure.  

  1. Calculate the volume of 0.5% albumin (w/v) in dPBS solution required to create a 0.05 mg/mL stock solution of IGF-1-LR3. 
  2. Prepare the solution of 0.5% albumin in sterile dPBS in a sterile falcon tube in the BSC. 
  3. Retrieve stock powder from storage location (IGF-1-LR3 powder is kept at -20 degrees C).
  4. If the stock powder is in a vial, centrifuge the vial containing IGF-1-LR3 powder for 30 seconds and then transfer the vial to the BSC. If the stock powder is in a circular jar, simply bring straight into BSC. 
  5. Using a micropipette, transfer 0.5% albumin solution from the falcon tube to the stock vial to reconstitute the powder to a concentration of 1.0 mg/mL. Pipette mix thoroughly and smoothly to dissolve the stock powder, taking care not to spill any of the solution. 
  6. Transfer the entire aliquot back to the falcon tube containing 0.5% albumin in dPBS. Repeat steps 5 - 6 twice more, washing with larger volumes of 0.5% albumin solution if needed to ensure that the entire amount of powder is dissolved.
  7. Check the vial to ensure that no powder is left.If any powder remains, repeat step 8 until the vial is clean.
    * *Note: this powder is difficult to dissolve. You may find that you cannot achieve a fully dissolved solution. In that case, skip the filtering step, and simply aliquot the solution as is, ensuring it is as homogenously mixed as possible while aliquoting. 
  8. Using a serological pipette, carefully mix the solution to ensure a homogenous mix (do not vortex!) 
  9. *Pour or pipette solution into a syringe filter unit and filter into a new sterile falcon tube. 
  10. Transfer the solution into sterile microtubes. Remember to add at least 5 uL to your desired aliquot volume to account for loss of liquid from pipetting.
  11. Enter details in Stockyard V2 under "Create Mix".
  12. Place aliquots into an appropriately sized container (e.g. cryobox, 500 mL sterile pot) and stick Stockyard label on the container. Add a note of the volume per aliquot for future users. 
  13. Store in - 20 degrees C freezer.

##  6b. Method/Procedure (suitable for Peprotech Cat# AF-100-11R3)

Note: Please perform this procedure with the BSC light turned off. Growth
factors are often sensitive to light exposure.  

  1. Calculate the volume of 0.5% albumin (v/v) in dPBS solution required to create a 0.05 mg/mL stock solution of IGF-1-LR3. 
  2. Prepare the solution of 0.5% albumin in sterile dPBS in a sterile falcon tube in the BSC. 
  3. Retrieve stock powder from storage location (IGF-1-LR3 powder is kept at -20 degrees C).
  4. Using a microfuge, centrifuge the vial containing IGF-1-LR3 powder for 30 seconds and then transfer the vial to the BSC.
  5. Using a micropipette, transfer sterile MilliQ water from the falcon tube to the stock vial to reconstitute the powder to a concentration of 1.0 mg/mL. Pipette mix thoroughly and smoothly to dissolve the stock powder, taking care not to spill any of the solution.
