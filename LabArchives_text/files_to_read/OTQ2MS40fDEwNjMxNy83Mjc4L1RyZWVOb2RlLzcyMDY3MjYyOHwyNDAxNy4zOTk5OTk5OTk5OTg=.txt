Passage 1 - Thaw 1x vial (1 million cells, Cell line ID: GTO6s-p Sea Turtle) into 1xT75.


Sea Turtle cells:  
Growth medium: RPMI-1640 with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). Antibiotics can
also be used at concentrations of 1%  
penicillin/streptomycin (10,000 U/mL stock), 1% amphotericin B (250 μg/mL
stock)  
Incubation temperature (°C): 30  
Incubation CO2 (%): 5%  
  
1M cells/mL in 1ml per vial  
  
Seed at 7500 live cells/cm2 \- 562.5K cells into 1x T75  
  
Remove 600ul from vial then re-freeze remaining cells back down still in DMEM
+ GlutaMax with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS)1% penicillin/streptomycin (10,000
U/mL stock), supplemented with 10% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO).  




# Procedure \- Thaw and Seed

### Note: Fibroblasts do NOT require Gelatin coated Flasks, and do NOT require
p38i.

2\. Placed 10mL of sea turtle growth media in water bath: 11:40am - 12:00pm  
  
NOTE - 50% GM feed for a T75 would be 5ml, 100% feed would be 10ml

3\. Select the vial/s for thawing. Note the location of the vial in Liquid
Nitrogen(LN) Dewer.  
Path: Stockyard v1 > Frozen Cultures > Select Vial/s (Use highest number
first, ie 62of62)

GTO6s-p vial was located in:

Tower 6 Box 6 C5

4\. Obtain selected number of cryovial/s from LN Dewar and thaw in the 30'C
water bath on a foam floater for a maximum of 5 minutes. 11:58 - 12:03

5\. Spray and wipe the cryovial and growth media thoroughly with 70% EtOH and
transfer into the Biohazard Safety Cabinet (BSC).

6\. 600uL of cell suspension was transferred to 9.6mL of growth media.

9\. Resuspend cells thoroughly and immediately extract 2 x 20uL into a
microcentrifuge tubes. First, 60uL of trypan blue was added which made the
cell suspension too dilute. To the second aliquot taken, 20uL was added to
constitute a 1:1 dilution.

10\. Perform cell count (Refer to VSOP-007) from collected sample and use the
Cell Counting Widget (below) to enter data.

11\.  Extract all contents from the centrifuge tube and dispense into the
prepared growth media. Wash the tube with 5-10 mL of the same growth media to
extract remaining cells attached to the tube.  
12\. Transfer the pre-warmed flasks from the 30C incubator into the BSC.
12:25pm  
13\. Add required volume of growth media to each flask, ensuring the entire
surface is coated. Use the 'Bec Drop' to lay down the flasks.``

14\. Transfer and incubate overnight at 30C.
