Aim/Purpose: To investigate the effect of gelatin on maturation and proliferation
Hypothesis: Coating gelatin plates at a concentration of 5 mg/ml will promote proliferation and maturation of C2C12 cells
Technical Gap: The effect of various concentrations of gelatin on maturation and proliferation as a coating in our well plates and as an ingredient is not yet known.
Method/Procedure


Background:

Gelatin is something that is available in-house at Vow and hence its potential
on maturation can be easily explored. However, it must be sterile filtered
(0.1uM) in order to be used so as to not result in contamination. Increasing
concentrations of gelatin will be tested as both a coating in a 96 well plate
and as a media supplement in E6 in seperate assays. Gelatin concentrations in
Milli-Q water and in E6 will need to be made up and sterile filtered prior to
use in the assay. In literature (see Background page) it was found that
gelatin also promotes proliferation. Since, its potential is being explored
here in the context of maturation - it is also worth exploring its effect on
proliferation at the same time despite its irrelevance in this project stream.

Two assays will be running simultaneously:

  1. Maturation Assay \- coating and media supplement (2 x 96 well plates)
  2. Proliferation Assay - coating and media supplement (2 x 96 well plates)

Thawing out 2 x C2C12 WCBs to obtain 691,200 cells to seed both assays:

  1. WED (02/06): Thaw out 2 x WCB vial (500K ea) of C2C12
  2.  Coat 2 x 96 well plates for coating

Maturation Assay (2 x 96 well plates):

  1. FRI (04/06): Seed 2 x 96 well plate at 6000 cells/well 
  2. SAT (05/06): 100% Feed - DAY 1
  3. SUN (06/06): 100% Feed - DAY 2 
  4. MON (07/06): 100% Feed - DAY 3
  5. TUES (08/06): 100% Feed - DAY 4
  6. WED(09/06): FIX and Primary Stain (MyoG, MF20) - DAY 5
  7. THUR (10/06): Secondary Stain (MyoG, MF20) - DAY 6
  8. FRI (11/06): Analyse Results

Proliferation Assay (8 x 96 well plates - 4 x coating, 4 x supplementation):

  1. FRI (04/06): Seed 4 x 96 well plate at 1200 cells/well
  2. SAT (05/06): FIX + DAPI 24H Plate, 100% Feed 3 x 96 well plates
  3. SUN (06/06): FIX + DAPI 48H Plate
  4. MON (07/06): FIX + DAPI 72H Plate
  5. TUES (08/06): FIX + DAPI 96H Plate
  6. WED (09/06): Image 4 x 96w plates and analyse results
