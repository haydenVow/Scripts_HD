Process:

  1. Image all 5 flasks using the Primo on 4x and 10x (two images per magnification will do)
  2. Returned vessels to incubate at: 

  * [X]  30ºC, 5% CO2 (reptilian cells)
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (aviary cells)

  

  * Incubator (#116), Lab [Main/Library/Production] - for cultures 10500, 10501, 10502
  * Incubator (#120), Lab [Main/Library/Production] - for cultures 10503, 10504




### Observations/Summary:

10500 - growing well, should be ready for a passage on Mon

10501 - growing well, should be ready for a passage on Mon

10502 - substantial cell death noted, refer to images

10503 - growing well, should be ready for a passage on Mon

10504 - growing well, should be ready for a passage on Mon
