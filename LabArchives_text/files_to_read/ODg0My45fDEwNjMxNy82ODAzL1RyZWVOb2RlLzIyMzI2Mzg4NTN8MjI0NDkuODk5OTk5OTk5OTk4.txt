Aim/Purpose


Determine if Nuvonis quail fibroblast suspension cells can survive and
proliferate alternative basal mediums


Hypothesis


At least one of the following alternative suspension basal mediums; DMEM/F12,
RPMI and Hycell CHO will enable the cells to survive and proliferate in
suspension culture conditions


Technical Gap


The current price to procure Freestyle medium is $260 per litre. In order to
produce a significant number of cells at scale the cost of the growth medium
needs to be significantly reduced. To begin evaluating this several different
basal media compositions will be evaluated to determine if the Nuvonis
suspension cells are able to survive and proliferate in these alternative
growth mediums.


Method/Procedure


  1. Prepare 150 mL of each of the following media conditions:
    1. Freestyle 293 + other*
    2. Hycell CHO + other*
    3. RPMI + other*
    4. DMEM/F12+ other*  
  
Other - Difco yeast extract (1g/L) + L-Ornithine monohydrochloride (20 mg/L) +
Putrescine dihydrochloride (20 mg/L) + IGF-1 LONG R3 (50 μg/L) + EGF (10 μg/L)
+ Anti-clumping agent (1:100)  
  
*only add growth factor on the day the growth media is required
  2. Determine electrical conductivity and pH of each sample
  3. Seed 4x E125 flasks with Nuvonis suspension quail cells (50,000 cells per mL, 1.5M cells per flask, 6M cells total)
  4. Sample cells approximately 24 hrs after seeding
  5. Repeat step 4 for at least 4 days following seeding
  6. If any of the conditions have reached a density of 800,000 - 1,000,000 cells/mL dilute the cultures to a density of 50,000 cells/mL
  7. Repeat step 5 for the next 3 days following the passage
  8. If any of the conditions have reached a density of 800,000 - 1,000,000 cells/mL dilute the cultures to a density of 50,000 cells/mL
  9. Allow the cultures to remain in culture until the density surpasses 1,000,000 cells/mL and monitor each day to determine if either the density continues to increase or the cells viability decreases
