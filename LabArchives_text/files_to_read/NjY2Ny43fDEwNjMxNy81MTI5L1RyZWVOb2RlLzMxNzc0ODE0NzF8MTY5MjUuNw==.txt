Note  
Due to cells becoming detached from the plate during fixing and dapi staining,
it was not possible to obtain any cell counts for this experiment (see image
below). Instead, phase contrast images were compared visually to observe
differences in confluence between conditions.

and dapi stained.

  




Phase contrast images of the day 5 plate were used to make visual comparisons
between conditions. Day 5 was selected as on day 6 images were taken at 5x
magnification (instead of 10x), making the cells more difficult to see, and on
day 7, the images were too over exposed to see clearly.

Image: Phase contrast images captured at 10x magnification prior to fixing.  




Observations/ Results  
Note that due to cell loss during fixation, these observations were made based
on phase contrast images only, not on any quantitative cell count data. Only
one well of each condition was imaged so we do not have any replicates to
compare. The interpretations listed bellow are first impressions only.  

1\. There was no visible difference in confluence between F_CHOMP07 and F_
CHOMP09 MCBs.  
2\. F_CHOMP07 WCB had lower confluence than F_ CHOMP09 WCB.  
3. There was no visible difference in confluence between F_ CHOMP09 MCB and WCBs however CHOMP07 WCB showed lower confluence than it's MCB.  
4\. It was not possible to compare F_ CHOMP09 WCB cells cultured in fresh
growth factors compared to a thawed 'bullet' because cells did not survive in
either condition.  
5\. F_ CHOMP09 WCB cells did not survive in DMEM/F12 + 20% KSR.  
6\. It was not possible to compare growth rates of F_ CHOMP09 WCB cells in ACF
media containing growth factors, compared to those containing no growth
factors (KSR only), as cells did not survive in either condition.  
7\. Very few cells survived and attached to the culture vessel in Fibrolife
media.
