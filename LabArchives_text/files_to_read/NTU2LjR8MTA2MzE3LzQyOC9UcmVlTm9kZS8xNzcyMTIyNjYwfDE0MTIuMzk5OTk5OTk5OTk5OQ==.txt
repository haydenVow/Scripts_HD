Process:

1\. Aliquotted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then
placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath for a minimum of 20 minutes
prior to use:

  1. Growth media (for seeding):    30   mL in    1x 50 mL    tube
  2. Times that all aliquots were placed in the water bath to warm before use  10:48 

Note: if aliquots were placed in water bath at different times, record the
time stamp for each individual solution.




2\. Retrieve E125 flask from shaker flask and transfer to the BSC.

3\. Filter the media containing suspended fibroblasts through a 70um sterile
filter unit into a sterile 50 mL falcon tube.

4\. Take 2x 10ul sample of the filtered cell suspension and perform a cell
count using the haemocytometer and recorded the cell count data in the Google
Doc spreadsheet called 'Cell Count Spreadsheet' (see link below):

  1. Total cell number (Count1) was: 6,960,000   

  2. Total cell number (Count2) was: 4,440,000   

  3. Average count:    5,700,000      

5\. Validate cell viability by counting dead cells stained with tryphan blue
and calculate percentage relative to total cells:

5\. Spin down the filtrate (single cells in the media) at 3000 rpm for 5
minutes to pellet the cells.

  1. Start/Finish time for centrifugation was   11:38   \-   11:43

6\. Aspirate the spent media (supernatant) and re suspend the cell pellet in
fresh media at 100-500K cells per mL- this will depend on the cell count (the
higher the better).

7\. Volume of cell suspension required for subculture was:    12 mL  

8\. Transfer cell suspension into (non-gelatin coated)     E125    flasks.

7\. Transfer the new flask to incubate on the shaker platform at 100 RPM and
leave the cells at constant agitation until the next passage/cell count.

Observations/Summary:  

\- Visible aggregates in the cell suspension

-Centrifuged pellet was much smaller compared to the pellet that was used to seed the this E125 flask (ID: 6459-DOLLY12-Sheep P10-1of1).
