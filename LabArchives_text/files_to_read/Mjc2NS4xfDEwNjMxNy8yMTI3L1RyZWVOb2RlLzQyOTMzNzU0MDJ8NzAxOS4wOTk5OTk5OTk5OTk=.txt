## Feed performed by: Bec Screnci  




Growth Media:

  * [X ]  DMEM/F12 + 20% FBS + 1X P/S + 1:100 Anti-clumping agent + 100ng/mL FGF + 100ng/mL IGF-LR3
  * [X ]  DMEM/F12 + 20% FBS + 1X P/S + 1:100 RevitaCell + 100ng/mL FGF + 100ng/mL IGF-LR3




Process:

1\. Place the pre-aliquotted  10 mL  mL of each respective type of Growth
Media into the water bath  10:30 am

Added 100ng/mL of FGF-2 + IGF-LR3 to 1:100 Anti-clumping agent media

Added 100ng/mL of FGF-2 + IGF-LR3 to 1:100 RevitaCell media

  

2\. Placed shake tubes in centrifuge and centrifuge at 650 x g for 5 min at
RT.   11:38 - 11:43 am

Aspirated supernatant from each pellet

3\. Added 1mL of respective growth media to each tube and used a P1000 pipette
to break up cell clumps.

Remaining 9mL of each respective media was added afterwards and triturated
with 10mL serological pipette to break up cell clumps for each culture further
and resuspend cells evenly.

4\. Returned 2 x vessel to incubate at:   12:05 pm Shaking at 206 RPM

  * [X ]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (aviary cells)

  

  * Incubator (#67 ), Lab [Library]




  

  

Observations:

1:100 ACA -  cloudy supernatant with no visible clumps

1:100 RevitaCell - clear supernatant with a few x-small flakes visible

  

 100  % media changed on vessel(s)
