AIM/PURPOSE: Expand F_CHOMP09 MCB cells to a WCB of  ≥ 400M cells.

HYPOTHESIS:  Continued culture of an initial population of 1M F_CHOMP09 MCB
cells will allow for a bank of  ≥ 400M cells within 4 passages.

RESULTS SUMMARY:  The hypothesis was supported, a WCB of 746M cells was banked
after 4 passages. This took the form of 50 x 10M vials, 40x 5M vials and 23 x
2M vials. The average cell doubling time over the course of the expansion was
2.84 days.

CONCLUSIONS:  A WCB of 746M F_CHOMP09 cells was banked.

NEXT STEPS: The  F_CHOMP09 WCB will be used for production runs and by the
science team. When this WCB has been exhausted, additional MCB to WCB
expansions may be required.
