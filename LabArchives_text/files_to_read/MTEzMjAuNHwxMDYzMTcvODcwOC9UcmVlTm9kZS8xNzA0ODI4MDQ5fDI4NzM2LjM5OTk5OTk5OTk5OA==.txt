Aim / Goal


We aim to seed "Pork bun" gel to:

  1. Determine effect of alginate MW on the stability of the scaffold over time, in addition to effect on cell proliferation.
  2. Compare the effects of suspension versus adherent media on Nuvonis cell proliferation within the gel.


Hypothesis


We hypothesise in this experiment we will observe

  1. Reduced gel degradation overtime in the conditions containing medium molecular weight (MW) alginate, compared to the gel formulations that do not contain medium MW Alginate. 
  2. The adherent cultures will proliferate faster in the gel scaffold compared to the suspension cultures.


Notes/ Things to keep in mind during this experiment

  * Scaffold to media concentration 
  * Scaffold handling
  * Removing cells that have released into the media and grow rapidly

Protocol


## Things to complete before starting the seeding experiment:

  1. Create the gel conditions. Refer to page '28 JUN 2 - Pork Bun Gel Batch02 Creation' for the Protocol used to create and sterilise each gel formulation. 
  2. Create and filter (22um filter) the crosslinking solution CaCLs (100mM). (DONE MIX ID: 12883) 
  3. Set up 6x 6-WP (Ultra-low attachment tissue culture plates) and Label according to the plate map in figure 1. 
  4. Prepare the reagents: 
    1. Add growth factors (EGF and IGF)  to the suspension growth medium. The volumes required can be calculated in the E8 calculator. 
    2. Place the gel formulation in ambient conditions for one hour prior to beginning the experiment. 
    3. Place the 2x types of growth medium (suspension and adherent GM)  in the water for a minimum of 20 minutes prior to use. 

Figure 1. Plate Map for Batch02 Experiment.

##  

  1. Place 1x cell strainer, followed by the 3D-printed gel mould into each well plate. 
  2. Fill 'no cell control' plates with each ge to be level with the 3D printed moulds using sterile spatula. 
  3. Weigh the remaining gel to calculate the remaining mass of gel, to then calculate the required amount of cells needed to seed per gel. 
    1. Medium MW gel: 
      1. Mass measured: 17.77,
      2. Since density is 0.99g/mL) so actual volume is (17.77/0.99) = 17.9495
    2. Low MW gel: 
      1. Mass measured: 17.93, 
      2. Since density is (0.99g/mL) so actual volume is (17.77/0.99) = 17.9495

  

## Cell Seeding Protocol - FOR PORK BUN GEL

  1. Perform cell count. Density for experiments: 15 million cells / mL.
    1. Cell Supply Culture ID: 12684  
      1. Cell count (total): 3802 M
      2. Cell count (per mL): 2.72M cells/mL
    2. Volume of cell suspension aliquoted for this experiment:
      1. MED: 98.98mL
      2. LOW: 98.87mL  


  2. Passage cells. Put required cell volume into 50mL centrifuge tubes.
  3. Centrifuge cell suspension for 5 mins at 700g. 
    1. LOW Start time: 17:55
    2. MED Start Time: 1958
  4. Based on cell count, use c1V1=c2V2 to determine amount of biogel required.
  5. Using a 5 mL syringe, stir biogel and slowly  draw up required amount and transfer to sterile specimen jar.
  6. Remove supernatant from cells, resuspend in media (~30uL / mL of biogel). Transfer to biogel in jar with a 1mL pipette, slowly stirring into ink as you do. Make sure to get into tip of cartridge and that it entirely incorporated (~1.5 min).
  7. Draw up into a syringe and add to anchor moulds inside of a cell strainer in a 6-WP
  8. Add CaCl2 solution (100mM) to gel disks in the cell strainer and crosslink for 15 mins. (gel handling and crosslinking steps will be edited upon findings from Zoe's dry-lab experiments). 
    1. LOW 1841/1856
    2. MED 2031
  9. Following crosslink, remove scaffolds with cell strainer and large sterile forceps to a new 6 well plate.
  10. Wash scaffolds in media at RT according to this:
    1. 1x 1 min wash low 1907/ med 2100
    2. 1x 5 min wash Low 1918/ med 2114
    3. 1 x 10 min wash at 37 C Low 1932 med/ 2127
  11. After scaffolds are washed of all excess CaCl2, slowly pipette in growth medium for each culture condition (refer to growth medium table above).

  12. Leave for 1 day prior to feeding to ensure stabilisation of construct.
  13. Initiate feed schedule outlined below. 

  

## Feeding Schedule

  1. Culture duration: in cell strainers for 7 days
  2. Every other day 100% feeds. Remove 1000% of the growth medium in each well/ scaffold (7mL) and replaced with new growth medium every  other day. 

## Monitoring and Stain Schedule

  1. Take 3 images at 5x and 3 images at 10x
  2. Check for signs of contamination.
