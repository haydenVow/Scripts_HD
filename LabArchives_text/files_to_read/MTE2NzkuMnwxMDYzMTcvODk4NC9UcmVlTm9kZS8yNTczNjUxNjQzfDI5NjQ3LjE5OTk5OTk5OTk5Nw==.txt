Process:

Aliquoted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then
placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath > 30 minutes prior to use

  1. Observed cultures under the microscope and recorded confluence in the table above. 
  2. Imaged cultures on 10x magnification (captured in Mia)
  3. TrypLE:     60 mL 
  4. dPBS (for washing & neutralising)   180 mL
  5. Growth media (for pellet resuspension and seeding):   900 mL 
  6. Washed the flask(s) with dPBS. Repeat to remove KSR.
  7. Added  15  mL tryple to each vessel/well and incubated at 37˚C for  30 minutes   
  8. Neutralised with   15  mL dPBS to each vessel (warmed) and combined cell suspension into four  50   mL tubes.
  9. Strained cells to seperate into single cells.
  10. Centrifuged at 650 x g for 5 min.
  11. Aspirated+ discarded supernatant
  12. Resuspended pellet(s) in  10  mL media.  
Performed a cell count using the hemocytometer and recorded the cell count
data in widget or the Google Doc spreadsheet called 'Cell Count Spreadsheet'
(see link below):

  13. Total cell number was:  

  14. Re-seeded cells as per table above.

  15. Transferred flasks to incubate at 37ºC, 5% CO2, library lab incubator #77




So many more cells more cells than expected! May have been seeded at a higher
density than recored (18/07) as cells were sticky.
