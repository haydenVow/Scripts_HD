Process:

  1. Aliquoted:
    1. 5 mL of D/F + 10% FBS + 1xP/S 
      1. Placed in water bath. Timestamp:   12:06  
  2. Paused shaker by pressing the "play" button on the controller on the side wall of the incubator
  3. Collected culture vessel from shaker, wiped with ethanol-sprayed cloth and brought into BSC
  4. Centrifuged at 300 x g for 5 min. Timestamp: 12:16 - 12:21
  5. Aspirated entire supernatant, taking care to not disrupt or aspirate pellet 
  6. Replaced with 5 mL of fresh, warmed media
  7. Re-suspended cultures for even cell suspension
  8. Took 1 x 100 uL sample from 5 mL cell suspension and followed procedure in entry below to count cells.
  9. Gently pipette-mixed cultures again before moving back to spin tubes 
  10. Returned vessel to incubator and replaced in clamp. Timestamp: 12:39   

  11. Incubator (#116), Lab [Main/Library/Production]




Stain and image:

  1. Took 100 uL samples of each culture, transferred to wells in 96 well plate
  2. Prepared two stain buffers of:
    1. 1 mL dPBS and 5 drops Hoechst  
    2. 1 mL dPBS and 5 drops NucGreen  
  3. Added 20 uL of Hoechst stain buffer to each well, pipet mixed each well
  4. Incubated at room temperature in the dark for 10 minutes  16:43 -16:53   

  5. Added 20 uL of NucGreen stain buffer to each well, pipet mixed each well
  6. Incubated at room temperature in the dark for 10 minutes  16:55 - 17:05   

  7. Centrifuged at 650 RCF for 1 minute 17:09 - 17:10  

  8. Took images of each well on the blue and green fluorescence channels using the Zaber on culture 7742  
  9. Plate setup was as follows:
    1. Row B, 2-5:
      1. 7342
      2. 7415
      3. 7465
