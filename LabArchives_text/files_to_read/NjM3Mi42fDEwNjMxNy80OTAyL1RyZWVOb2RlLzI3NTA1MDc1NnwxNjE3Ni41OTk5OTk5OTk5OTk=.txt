Process:

1\. Aliquotted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then
placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath for a minimum of 20 minutes
prior to use:

  1.  TrypLE:  60 mL in | 1x 70 mL pot | 
  2.  dPBS (for neutralising)  120  mL in | 1x 120 mL pot | 
  3.  Growth media (for pellet resuspension):   1 mL in | 6x 15 mL | tubes 
  4.  Time that all aliquots were placed in the water bath to warm before use:  13:13

Note: if aliquots were placed in water bath at different times, record the
time stamp for each individual solution.




2\. Washed the flask(s) with dPBS.

3\. Added | 10 |mL tryple to each vessel/well and incubated at 37ºC for | 20 |
min

  1.  Start/Finish time for TrypLE was:   13:41 - 14:01
  2.  Note that fibroblasts typically require 15-18 minutes of tryple incubation. 

4\. Neutralised with | 10 | dPBS (warmed) and combined cell suspension into a
| 6x 50 mL | tubes.

5\. Centrifuged at 650 x g for 5 min

  1.  Start/Finish time for centrifugation was:   14:20 - 14:25 




6\. Aspirated the supernatant(s).

7\. Resuspend pellet(s) in | 1 |mL | respective growth | media.

8\. Performed a cell count using the haemocytometer and recorded the cell
count data in the Google Doc spreadsheet called 'Cell Count Spreadsheet' (see
link below):

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1DPzKubYxfHmWogVPihC-
SSIBtIylyrBQE5kRX5Z8NtI/edit#gid=0

9\. Total cell number was:

Condition 1:  | 1,680,000 |

Condition 2:  | 1,116,000 |

Condition 3:  | 2,100,000 |

Condition 5:  | 2,706,000 |

RPMI control:   | 3,208,000 |

Serum control:    | 7,590,000 |

10\. Calculate the required volume cell suspension & freeze medium to generate
a concentration of ~2E6 (2M) cells/mL. ~1 million fibroblasts per cryovial
should be frozen.




11\. Prepared  5 mL Freeze Medium: (FBS + 10% DMSO). ID #  M7931

Stored at 4ºC until use to keep chilled.

12\. Centrifuged cells at 650 x g for 5 min.  15:40 - 15:45

Whilst centrifuge is spinning, prepared & printed vial labels, labelled
cryovials.




13\. Aspirated supernatant carefully, taking care not to disturb the pellet.

14\. Resuspended the pellet in | 1 |mL freeze media (chilled, to reduce DMSO
toxicity).

15\. Aliquotted | 1000 |µL into | 5 | x cryovials (already labelled).

16\. Tightened the lids & transfer the cryovials to a Mr. Frosty immediately
into the -80ºC freezer.   15:55

17\. Allow the cells to freeze for at least 18-24 hours before transferring to
Liquid Nitrogen storage.
