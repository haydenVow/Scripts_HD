Aim: Assess initial cell adhesion on konjac, konjac with curdlan, beancurd
stick, and beancurd knot scaffolds sterilised by dry autoclave.

  

Experimental plan

  1. Prepare Konjac samples 
  2. Prepare Beancurd samples
  3. Sterilise samples (through autoclave) 
  4. Prepare ACF media 
  5. Obtained cells from cell expansion team 
  6. Transfer scaffolds onto plate for seeding 
  7. Seed scaffolds at 1M cells pers scaffold 
  8. Hoechst stain 
  9. Zaber image scaffolds 

Changes to experimental plan

  * In house Konjac samples did not set to form a solid structure (rather it was a liquid gel), therefore commercial Konjac samples were used 
  * Seeding amount changed from 1M to 0.75M due to lower than expected cells harvest
