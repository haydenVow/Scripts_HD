Method:

60 pieces of both the gelatex zein and gelatex gluten samples were punched
using the metal biopsy hole-puncher.  
  
Work was contained within the BSC using ethanol sprayed utensils.  
  
Pieces were collected in glass petri dishes, spaced out across 2 dishes per
scaffold type to prevent scaffolds from sticking to each other during
sterilisation.  
  
Observations:  
Zein material was fragile to handle and led to a lot of material loss due to
breakage.
