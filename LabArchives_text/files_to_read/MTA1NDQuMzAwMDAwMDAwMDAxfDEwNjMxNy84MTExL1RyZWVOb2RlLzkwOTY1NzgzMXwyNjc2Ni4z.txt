Process
  
  
CHO HD basal medium (Part A) + Nuvonis

1L CHO HD basal medium:

  1. Resuspend 21.9g of Part A in 900ml milliQ water with constant stirring until powder is completely dissolved. Do not heat the water. 
  2. Add 1.6g of sodium bicarbonate powder and stir until dissolved. 
  3. Adjust the pH to 7.0-7.6 using 1N HCl or 1N NaOH- pH was already at 7.2 so no need for this step.  

  4. Make up the volume to 1000ml with tissue culture grade water (added 100 mL of MQW).  

  5. Remove 13.2 mL of basal medium from the storage container, and add the following amounts of Nuvonis ingredients with the exception of the growth factors which will be added every time medium is aliquoted to perform feeds:
  6. Sterile filter (membrane filter with porosity of 0.22 micron or less).
