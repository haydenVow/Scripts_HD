Overview


Culture multiple cell lines to a sufficient quantity for 'omics interrogation
and digestion assays (for bio-accessibility testing compared to plant based
meat alternatives).  
  
  
Cell lines of interest:

CHOMP: single cell fibroblasts

C2C12s: differentiated myoblasts

KUZCO: single cell fibroblasts (already in culture see)

KUZCO: differentiated myoblasts

NUVONIS Quail: single cell fibroblasts (adherent)

BUFFY: differentiated myoblasts (already in culture see)

  

For MuSC culture:

  * Only ACF media compositions will be assessed for differentiation -> E6 media
  * Cultures will be expanded till confluent, then switched to respective conditioned media
  * Conditions will be differentiated for 14 days then harvested on the 14th day.

  
  
Cell requirements:

We require 3 technical replicates for each cell line and each analysis
(digestion and multiomic)

  
For multiomics analysis we require 1-10mg for each omic per cell line, per
replicate: Lipidomic, Proteomic and Metabolomic (Untargeted)

  
For digestion and subsequent analysis we will need 10mg of dry cells. Sample
needs to be freeze dried. When cells are dried they can lose up to 90% of
their weight so we would need ~100mg of cells for each cell line.  
  
From production metric tracker 'proliferation metrics' tab, row 34. Myoblasts
at P4, 4X4CFs seeded with 17464000 cells on the 2021-04-15, yielded 109887500
cells when harvested 5 days later (2021-04-20) and had a wet weight of 0.948g
= 948mg. (237mg per 4CF ~28M cells). As such, 1x 2CF should provide
approximately 120mg - enough for both analyses  
  
So for the digestion assays we would likely only need 1x2CF worth of cells,
seeded with 2M cells 5 days prior to harvest. Which would yield ~118.5mg, 14M
cells.  
  
Note- we will also need at least 30k cells for a bradford assay (~0.3mg).  
  
  
Total =

3x confluent 2CFs per cell line  
  


Aim


To culture a sufficient quantity of the following cell lines of interest
CHOMP, NUVONIS Quail and KUZCO single cell fibroblasts, C2C12s, KUZCO and
BUFFY diff erentiated myoblasts for assessment via omics and bioaccessibility
assays.


Experiment timeline


NOTE \- BUFFY: differentiated myoblasts (already in culture see) and KUZCO
single cell fibroblasts (already in culture see) will need to be expanded also
seeded into 3x2CF then cultured for 14 days. Timeline for this is currently
unknown and will need to be incorporated into the below work:

DayDateTask  
Day -3  

         MuSCs:

  * Thaw 14 x KUZCO MuSCs (R&D, 468-510k cells per vial) (BUFFY and C2C12 already in culture)  
  

  * Seed 3x2CF with 2.2 M cells per flask and 1x T75 with 131.3K cells (~1750 cells/cm2) for each cell line.   
  
MAKE UP MEDIA:  
  
Growth media (DMEM/F12 + 20% FBS + 1X P/S + P38i (10uM)): 2.25L  
  
  
Fibroblasts:

  * 4 x Nuvonis fibroblasts (7.5M cells per vial), 2 x CHOMP fibroblast (15M cells per vial)  


  * Seed 3x2CF with 9.9M per cell line  (7850 cells/cm2).  
  
Place the seeded flasks directly into the 30'C incubator (do not leave them in
the BSC for 30 minutes). Fibroblasts do not need gelatin coated flasks and do
not need p38i.  
  
MAKE UP MEDIA:  
Growth media (DMEM/F12 + 20% FBS + 1X P/S): 2L (for chomp and KUZCO fibros)  
  
Nuvonis media: 1.5L

  
Day -2  

  * 100% feed all MuSC cultures with GM (DMEM/F12 + 20% FBS + 1X P/S + P38i (10uM))
  * 50% feed all Fibroblast cultures with (DMEM/F12 + 20% FBS + 1X P/S)  
  

  
Day -1  

  * Prepare Diff media:  
  
E6 + 1X P/S: 7.5L  
\+ AN EXTRA 1.2L for the incoming 2CF of BUFFY MuSCs  
= 8.7L  
  
DMEM/F12 + 2% HS + 1X P/S: 850ml  
  

  
Day 0  

If confluent switch all MuSC cultures to diff media (OR PASSAGE AT THIS POINT
IF WE NEED MORE CELLS) HS into T75s, E6 into 2CFS  
  
Day 1  

  * 100% feed MuSC cultures with diff media

  
Day 2  

  * 100% feed MuSC cultures with diff media

Day 4  

  * 100% feed MuSC cultures with diff media

  
Day 5  

  * 100% feed MuSC cultures with diff media  
Prepare Diff Media:  
  
E6 + 1X P/S: 7.5L  
\+ AN EXTRA 1.2L for the incoming 2CF of BUFFY MuSCs  
= 8.7L  
  
DMEM/F12 + 2% HS + 1X P/S: 850ml

Day 12  
  

  * 100% feed MuSC cultures with diff media

  
  
Day 13  
  

  * 100% feed MuSC cultures with diff media

  
  
Day 14  
  

  * Harvest all cultures separately, perform cell count (do not combine pellets)
  * 1x 2CF worth of each cell line should be taken forward for 'omics work (cells should be frozen). Do not combine pellets across cultures.
  * From each the 2CF for each cell line remove 40K fresh cells from each and run bradford total protein analysis assay on fresh cells (n=3)
  * Remaining cells should be freeze-dried (USYD - Tom's contact Fariba deghani \- Chris has access) and then passed off to Ruchira for digestion assays.
