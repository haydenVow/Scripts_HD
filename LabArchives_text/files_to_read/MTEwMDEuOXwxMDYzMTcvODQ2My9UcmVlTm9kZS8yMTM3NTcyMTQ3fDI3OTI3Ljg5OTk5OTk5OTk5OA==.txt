Before Starting Ensure:

  * Matrix reagents are made up fresh:
    * Collagen I to 2.6mg/mL - stock is at 6.17mg/mL - dilution factor 1:2.4
      * need ~ 2 mL total (make 2.5 mL)
      * Leave in the fridge until use.
    * Matrigel is thawed in the fridge (no more than 10degs) first thing in the morning to maintain as liquid
    * Reagents have been sterile-filtered
  *  ~~Agar is autoclaved first thing in the morning and maintained on the hotplate to keep molten (or a small, high temp Sous Vide bath)~~
  * Week before: adhere 6x nylon scaffolds to petri dishes using PDMS    27/06/2022 
    * Make PDMS Total Volume:    mL 
    * Pipette     mL  per plate for 6 petri dishes. 




Scaffold mounting, sterilisation and coating

  1. Autoclaved moulds should be placed into the hood with: 15cm dishes, molten agar, mould weights, forceps
  2. Place mould into 15cm dish and put sterile weight on top
  3. Surround outer edge with 2% agar and leave to set and seal the mould in place
  4. UV irradiate for 60 minutes under the mobile UV (reptile) lamp - start     :   am 
  5. Pre-coat with 0.2% Pluronic solution for 1 hour (to prevent adhesion), start     :   pm 




Preparation for Harvest

  1. Prepare 12 falcon tubes for cell harvest for 6 conditions of different cell densities (0, 2M, 5M, 7.5M, 10M, 15M) and 2 treatment conditions (with and w/o TGF-b)
  2. Completed calculations can be found here: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1nAKlh6US6Xud95YGlDTkI4LHBWjzlAxnhmTym1P2bUw/edit#gid=1981262089
  3. Media preparation for harvest and seeding: 50-50 RPMI/Hycell mix
    1. 200mL 50-50 RPMI/Hycell 
    2. 200mL 50-50 RPMI/Hycell with 5ng/mL TGF-b

Cell Harvest for mould seeding - Nuvonis suspesion protocol

  1. Harvest cells with Cell Supply passaging protocol
  2. Count cells with haemocytometer/Vicell for total yields:
    1. Total yield flask #12537 =   715.7 million   

    2. Total yield flask #12504 =   184.5 million 
    3. Total volume per #12537 =    197 mL  
    4. Total volume per #12504 =    57 mL  
    5. Cell concentration #12537 =    3.62M cells/mL  
    6. Cell concentration  #12504 =    3.21M cells/mL  
  3. Aliquot required volume into 2x falcon tube at each cell density:
    1. 2M/mL = 16M total per falcon x 2 =    4.4 mL   #12537  

    2. 5M/mL = 40M total per falcon x 2 =    11.05 mL  #12537
    3. 7.5M/mL = 60M total per falcon x 2 =    16.57 mL  #12537
    4. 10M/mL = 80M total per falcon x 2 =    25 mL  #12504
    5. 15M/mL = 120M total per falcon x 2 =    33.14 mL  #12537
  4. Centrifuge at 650g for 5 minutes: start    15:56 
  5. Resuspend pellets in 3.15mL of 50-50 Media with or w/o TGF-b per falcon tube
  6. Proceed to matrix additions below

  

Matrix formation for scaffold seeding - 5 cell densities + cell-free control

N.B. Repeat this gel formation for each falcon tube at the same time - i.e.
Add Collagen to all, then add DMEM to all etc. - BUT be sure to move quickly!

  1. Add Collagen I (Devro: final concentration 2.6mg/ml) and mix well with stripette (not resuspending):
    1. Collagen I volume to add =    3.25 mL  
  2. Add 10xDMEM/F12 and mix with stripette:
    1. 10x DMEM volume to add =    390 uL  
  3. Add 0.1M Sodium Hydroxide and mix with stripette:
    1. NaOH volume to add =    490 uL  
  4. Add Matrigel and mix with stripette:
    1. Matrigel volume to add =    720 mL  
  5. Remove pluronic from wells
  6. Seed    4mL    gel/matrix gently into scaffold ensuring good distribution around pillars in the well 
  7. Leave for    60-90    minutes to gel at 37°C - start time   17 : 50   
  8. Add     ~150mL   50-50 Media with or w/o TGF-b to entire 15mL dish, ensure entire mould is covered
  9. Culture at 37°C overnight before checking




Tips and Tricks for this protocol:

  * When pelleting cells, make sure they are completely dry
  * Flick pellet to dislodge before adding medium
  * Add Medium first to pellet to prevent clumping and cell death
  * Col1 is very viscous, pipette carefully - when adding 10x DMEM, it turns yellow
  * As soon as you add the NaOH, be quick as the Col starts to gel
  * Everything has to be exact, don't be tempted to add more cells than the volume stated if there are some left
  * Add cells slowly!
