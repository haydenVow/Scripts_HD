## Remove the Stimulation Lead Wire

1\. Removed the hook test clips from the electrode connection pins on the
culture dish lid for plate 2 (7996)  
  
The test hook can be released from the pin by squeezing the spring loaded test
hook handle. It is best not to touch the metal electrode pins while doing
this. Hold the plastic culture dish lid for stability. If any wires become
dislodged and the operator is unsure about reattachment, contact experiment
owner for assistance   Jared - 0420881185




## Imaging

1\. Imaged PLATE 2, taking whole well images of every well using the zaber
9:46  

For information on how to use the zaber, refer to:

ad19527eee9e42ed9db96faa911d6536

Tips for imaging the 12WP are to use 8x8 imaging sites in the HSC site
generator, remembering to change the spacing rule to field of view with 60 um
spacing. Remember to build the MM List in the HSC site generator and confirm
the number of images expected (usually >700) in the Mult-D Acq.




## Live Cell Contractions

The culture dish was left in the zaber after imaging and connected to the
stimulator. All other plates were removed from the stimulator. The voltage was
increased to try an initiate cell contraction and videos were captured of the
attempts (see table).
