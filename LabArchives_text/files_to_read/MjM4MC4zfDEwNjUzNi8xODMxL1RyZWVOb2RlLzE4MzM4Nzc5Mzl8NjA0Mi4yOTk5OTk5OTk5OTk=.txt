1\. Weigh out powders for 100L worth of media according to this spreadsheet.

2\. Store at 4'C until required.  




Hydrating the growth medium:

Unbeknownst at the time was the the amount of powders weighed out were
incorrectly weighed for 210L worth of media. Therefore a 2x concentrate was
made when the powder were added to 100L of water. Given that powders were
dissolved and the filter were not blocked suggest a 2x concentrate can be made
without clogging the filters.

1\. Clean the 150L pot with ethanol and water

2\. Place the empty pot (with lid removed) on a balance and tare the weight

3\. Add 70kg of ID water directly into the pot

4\. Add all the powders directly into the pot

5\. Mix the media using the electric mixer

6\. Add the remaining volume of water to bring the total weight to 100kg

7\. Continue mixing until all powder are dissolved

8. The media can now be added to the bag or palletank bag.




Filtering the growth media:

1\. Connect a pre-autoclaved piece of 3/8 - 5/8 piece of advantaflex with a
male NPC connector and cap attached onto the sterile end of the 0.2/0.1 um
filter unit.

2\. Attach a non-sterile piece of tubing on the non-sterile end of the filter
unit.

3\. Attach a 0.8/0.45 um filter onto the non-sterile end of the tubing from
the previous step

4\. Attach another piece of tubing onto the other end of the 0.8/0.45 um
filter

5\. Weld the sterile end of advantaflex onto a palletank bag (the same
palletank bag from the 04/07 media hydration was used)

6\. Attach the tubing into the peristaltic pump and begin filtering




Seeding satellite flasks

1\. Place the dip tube into the BSC

2\. Pump out 300 mL of growth media from the STR 200L bag into 2x E500 shake
flasks

3\. Transfer these flasks into main lab and place on a shaker platform at 120
RPM. Monitor every 2-3 days.
