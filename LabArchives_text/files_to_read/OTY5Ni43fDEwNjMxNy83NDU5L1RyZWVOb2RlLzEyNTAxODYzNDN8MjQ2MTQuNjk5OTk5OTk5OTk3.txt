### Process:

Aliquotted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then
placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath for a minimum of 20 minutes
prior to use, growth media was added directly to destination wells on 6 well
plates, 1 plate for PABPC1 clones d5A, 5D, 5E and 6C, one plate for
PABPC1+PTEN clones 1C, 1F and 2F.  

  1. TrypLE:     0.2mL per 24 well   
  2.  dPBS (for washing):    0.1mL per 24 well   
  3. Growth media (for seeding):     3mL per destination 6 well     

Aliquots were left at room temperature before use.




Passaging of each 24 well  

1\. Aspirated the supernatant and discard  

2\. wash with dPBS and remove supernat  

3\. pipette in 0.2 mL tryple

4\. incubate at 30 degrees for 8 mins  

6\. retrieve plates containing tryple and pipette up and down a few times to
ensure all cells have been lifted.

7\. transfer 60uL of trypalised cells to a PCR tube for DNA extraction

8\. Transfer remaining cell volume directly to destination well on 6 well
plate.

9\. Place 6 well plate in incubator at 37 degrees, 5% CO2.

10\. Proceed with DNA extraction by centrifuging PCR tubes for 3 minutes in
benchtop minifuge

11\. aspirate supernatant and add 25uL of QuickExtract

12\. Run QqEx program on Bentolab to extract DNA.

13\. Place DNA extracts at 4 degrees for future PCR amplification. in the main
lab white fridge
