RELATED TO MILESTONE: Milestone 2:

AIM/PURPOSE: To assess whether cells adhere to gluten/seitan and if different
treatments to gluten have an affect on cell adherence and adhesion
maintenance.  

HYPOTHESIS:  that DOLLY12 cells will be able to adhere on gluten that have
been treated with dry heat, autoclave and additional heat treatment

RESULTS SUMMARY:  See Report

CONCLUSIONS: What were the overall findings? This should be a concise summary
and not duplicate the information in the results/report. For example "We found
that Bovine MuSCs could only achieve a cell density 50% of that observed with
planar culture without undergoing precocious differentiation. These results
mean that we are currently limited to X cells/ml in suspension culture until
we find a way to inhibit precocious differentiation"

We found that cells can adhere to seitan samples treated with autoclave and
heat treatment, however growth was limited and there was no evidence of
maturation.

NEXT STEPS:

  * Prepare scaffolds differently, so that the size is more compatible with a 96 wp and surface area and thickness is similar, if not the same across allt he scaffolds
  * Image using the zaber, rather than the axio to obtain whole images of the scaffold so a DAPI count can be performed 
  * Employ a new method of scaffold handling to prevent scaffolds and cells from being damaged
