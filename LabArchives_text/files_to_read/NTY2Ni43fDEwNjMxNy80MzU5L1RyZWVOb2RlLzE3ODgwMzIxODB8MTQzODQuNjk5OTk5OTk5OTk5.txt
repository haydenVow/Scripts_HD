Introduction


While the immediate priority for Vow is the suspension adaptation of
fibroblast cells, future products will likely contain muscle. However, the
underlying reasons behind this choice while may seem obvious, lack the
quantitative data to justify them. For example, it may be commonly assumed
that muscle provides nutritional benefits over fibroblasts - however these
benefits have not been made clear and supported with the scientific method at
Vow. Hence, an opportunity to characterise the nutritional benefits of mature
(and immature) muscle opens up.  
  
One attractive benefit of agricultural meat is the high protein content that
many products inherently contain. This often is


Aim:


To identify the difference in protein content between:

  * Mature myoblasts
  * TGF-b \+ Vit C treated fibroblasts

and also to highlight the difference between BCA and Bradford quantification
assays.


Hypothesis:


Mature muscle cells yield higher total protein than TGF-b and Vit-C treated
fibroblasts.  
  
The BCA assay captures higher protein across all samples due to its
flexibility with protein-protein uniformity within the samples.


Timeline and protocol:


Protocol (fibroblasts):

  * Seed fibroblasts into T-flask and expand for several days
  * Passage fibroblasts into 24 well plate
  * Treat with 10 ng/mL TGF-b and 50mg/mL Vit-C when confluent 
  * Monitor for signs of peeling and stain with DAPI before peeling can occur.
  * Perform Bradford/BCA on same day as stain.

Protocol (myoblasts):

  * Seed myoblasts into 24 well plates after expansion in T-flasks.
  * Differentiate myoblasts for 14 days.
  * DAPI stain, then perform Bradford/BCA assay on same day.
  * If available, repeat DAPI stain and quantification process on MuSCs.

Protocol (Freeze-thaw):

  * Seal plate sides with adhesive foil and freeze plates in LN2 bath for 3 minutes
  * Thaw plates for 3 mins in water bath.
  * Repeat freeze-thaw cycle three more times
