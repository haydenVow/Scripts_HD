Perform bank using below volumes

  




## Performed by: Bonnie Tangey




Observation of KHAKIF prior to bank.

KHAKIF culture was 95% confluent however cells had a scrappy morphology, with
many appearing senescent.

Process:

  1. Aliquoted reagents and placed in the cell culture incubator to warm > 40 minutes prior to use  
TrypLE:  5mL  
dPBS (for washing and neutralising)    10mL  
Growth media (for pellet resuspension): 5mL

  2. Washed the flask(s) with dPBS.
  3.  Added | 5 |mL tryple to each vessel/well and incubated at 37ºC for | 10 | min. 
  4. Neutralised with |5mL  | dPBS (warmed) and combined cell suspension into a |50mL (per culture)| tube. 
  5. Centrifuged at approximately 650 x g for 5 min.
  6. Aspirated the supernatant(s).
  7. Resuspend pellet(s) in |5|mL | media | 
  8.  Performed a cell count using the hemocytometer and recorded the cell count data in the Google Doc spreadsheet called 'Cell Count Spreadsheet' (see link below):

SSIBtIylyrBQE5kRX5Z8NtI/edit#gid=0

  9. Total cell number was:  
|KHAKIF: 2.2M |

  10.  Centrifuged cells at approx. 650 x g for 5 min.

  11. Aspirated supernatant carefully, taking care not to disturb the pellet.

  12. Resuspended the pellets in CRYOSTORCS10

  13. Aliquoted | 1000ul/vial |µL into pre-labelled cryovials. 

  14. Tightened the lids & transfer the cryovials to a Mr. Frosty immediately into the -80ºC freezer.
