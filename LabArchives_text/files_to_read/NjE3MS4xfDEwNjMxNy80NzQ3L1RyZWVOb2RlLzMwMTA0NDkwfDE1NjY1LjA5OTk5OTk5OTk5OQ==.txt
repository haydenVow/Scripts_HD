Termination of culture

Obtaining a WCB of >300M cells as soon as possible was crucial for production
to hit their KRs this quarter. This is why a second CHOMP09 WCB was
established as a backup for the F_CHOMP09 WCB1, see lab book here: https://au-
mynotebook.labarchives.com/share/Vow%2520-%2520Team%2520Science/NTM5Ny42fDEwNjMxNy80MTUyLTM0MDU4L1RyZWVOb2RlLzE4ODIwODcyMzF8MTM3MDEuNTk5OTk5OTk5OTk5.

As a sufficient WCB of 756M cells was banked on 18/10/21, the second WCB is no
longer required. We therefore terminated this culture today.
