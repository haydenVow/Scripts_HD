Gelatin solution to coat 4 x 96 wp: 21.12 ml (19.2 ml + 10% extra)

Tryple for 1 x T175 that we choose to harvest: 10 ml

dPBS for 1 x T175 that we choose to harvest: 10 ml

Growth media for resuspension of cells in 1 x T175: 0.5 ml - 1ml (Always try
to aim to the lower end of the volume bracket to avoid diluting the cell count
too much; if cells are not too confluent but still want to passage, perhaps
resuspend in 0.25 ml of growth media)

Growth media for seeding 4 x 40 wells in the 96 wp: 38.4 (32 ml + 20% extra)

p38i for 4 x 40 wells in the 96 wp: 19.2 ul (16 ul + 20% extra)




### Process:

1\. Took image of vessel with microscope on phase setting.

2\. Gelatin coated     4     x    96 wp    vessel with sterile filtered 0.1%
gelatin solution and then incubated all coated flasks at 37˚C.

  1. Time when all vessels(s) placed into the incubator     11:10 -   a/pm 

3\. Aliquotted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then
placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath for a minimum of 20 minutes
prior to use:

  1. TrypLE:   10  mL in  1 x 15ml tube
  2.  dPBS (for neutralising):   10  mL
  3.  dPBS (for washing):     10   mL
  4. Growth media (for pellet resuspension):   0.5 mL
  5. Growth media (for seeding):     40   mL 

Time that all aliquots were placed in the water bath the warm before use
1:17-1:55   pm

Note: if aliquots were placed in water bath at different time, record the time
stamp for each individual solution.




4\. Removed vessel(s) from the incubator   2:02 pm

5\. Washed the vessel(s) with dPBS (warmed).

6\. Added    10   mL tryple to each vessel/well and incubated at 37˚C.

  1. Start/Finish for TrypLE was  2:08   :  2:23 pm 

7\. Neutralised with    10    ml dPBS and combined cell suspension into a   50
ml   tube.

8\. Centrifuged at 650 x g for 5 min.

  1. Start/Finish time for centrifugation was   2:31-2:36 pm 




9\. Aspirated the supernatant(s).

10\. Resuspended pellet(s) in     2  mL    DMEM/F12 + 20% FBS + 1x P/S + p38i
(10uM)  media  

11\. Aliquoted     10uL   of resuspended cells into a microcentrifuge tube for
cell count.

12\. Performed a cell count using the haemocytometer and recorded the cell
count data in the Google Doc spreadsheet: Cell Count Spreadsheet or cell count
widget below

  1. Total cell number was:   480 000     

  2. Volume of cell suspension required for subculture was:      0.256 ml       

  3. Cell density per vessel:     640       




13\. Transferred     256      µl of cell suspension to the pre-warmed
38.14   mL Growth media:     3:38 pm

14\. Transferred cell suspension into the pre-gelatin coated     4 X 96 wp
vessel.

15\. Left at RT in the BSC for 30 min to allow cells to settle    4:30-5:00 pm  

16\. Transferred vessel(s) to incubate at:

  * [X]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (avian cells)




Observations/Summary:

In the original flasks

8342-DOLLY12-Sheep P9-1of3  
8343-DOLLY12-Sheep P9-2of3  
8344-DOLLY12-Sheep P9-3of3

the confluence was too low so we decided to use Addy's T175 flasks instead.
