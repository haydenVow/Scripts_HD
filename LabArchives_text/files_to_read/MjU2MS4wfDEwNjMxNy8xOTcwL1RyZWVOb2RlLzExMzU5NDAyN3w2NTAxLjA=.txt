Culture IDs to feed

Vessel ID(s)  
Vessel Type(s)  
  
7136-DOLLY12-Sheep P13-1of1  
48WP (scaffolds with inserts)  
  
7139-DOLLY12-Sheep P13-1of1  
48WP (adherent culture - no inserts)  
  
  
  







Process:

1\. Filled a new 48-WP with media according to plate map above (Condition 1-4
media is in "Gelatin & Media" fridge in 4 x 120 mL pots, E6 is in 1 L bottle
in same fridge). Wrapped plate in foil.  

2\. Aliquotted ~1.5 mL of E6 in 1 x 15 mL tube (this is for feeding 5 x wells
of adherent cells in second 48-WP)

3\. Placed tube in waterbath and plate in incubator (plate needs at least 30
minutes in incubator)   11:05

4\. Retrieved culture plates and foil-wrapped media plate from Thermo
incubator. Retrieved 15 mL tube from waterbath. Ethanol sprayed and brought
into BSC.

5\. Using a well-ethanol sprayed hand, lifted HTP tray from 48WP with scafolds
by the edge and lifted into pre-filled 48-WP with warmed, fresh media. Moved
plate from original plate to new plate to keep labelling and culture ID in
place.

6\. Aspirated 250 uL (100%) of media from each well (A1 - A5) of 48WP with
adherent cultures (no scaffolds). Replaced with 250 uL per well from 15 mL
tube.

7\. Re-parafilmed scaffold plate and returned vessels to incubate at: 11:40

  * [x]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (aviary cells)

  

  * Incubator (#Thermo), Lab [Main/Library/Production]
