### Process:

1\. Took image of vessel with microscope on phase setting.

2\. Gelatin coated 2x T175 vessel with sterile filtered 0.1% gelatin solution
and then incubated all coated flasks at 37˚C.  

  1. Time when all vessels(s) placed into the incubator       

3\. Aliquotted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then
placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath for a minimum of 20 minutes
prior to use:

  1. TrypLE:  1x 20 mL  

  2.  dPBS 1x40mL   

  3. Growth media (for seeding):  600 mL + 300 uL p38i  

Time that all aliquots were placed in the water bath the warm before use
15:56

Note: if aliquots were placed in water bath at different time, record the time
stamp for each individual solution.

4\. Removed vessel(s) from the incubator  

5\. Washed the vessel(s) with dPBS (warmed).

6\. Added      10   mL tryple to each vessel/well and incubated at 37˚C.

  1. Start for TrypLE was  16:40 - 16:50

7\. Neutralised with     10mL     dPBS and combined cell suspension into a
50mL     tube.

8\. Centrifuged at 650 x g for 5 min.

  1. Start/Finish time for centrifugation was   16:56-17:01

9\. Aspirated the supernatant(s).

10\. Resuspended pellet(s) in     1 mL    Growth      media

11\. Aliquoted      10uL    of resuspended cells into a microcentrifuge tube
for cell count.

12\. Performed a cell count using the haemocytometer and recorded the cell
count data in the Google Doc spreadsheet: Cell Count Spreadsheet or cell count
widget below

  1. Total cell number was: C2C12  4,440,000    

  2. Volume of cell suspension required for subculture was:         
C2C12 4Cf:285 uL, T175: 80 uL per 30 mL media  

  3. Cell density per vessel:   500/cm2     




C2C12 PASSAGE - 2XT175

13\. Transferred      As above     µl of cell suspension to the pre-warmed
growth media

14\. Transferred cell suspension into the pre-gelatin coated      4xT175s,
1x4CF   vessels

15\. Left at RT in the BSC for 30 min to allow cells to settle   17:52  

16\. Transferred vessel(s) to incubate at: 18:31

  * [X] 37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells) Incubator 119 (4CF and 10566)
  * [X]  37ºC, 0% CO2 (mammalian cells) Incubator 118 (Remaining T175s
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (avian cells)
