### Process:

1\. Took image of vessel with microscope on phase setting.

2\. Gelatin coated      2 wells of 24 well plate with sterile filtered 0.1%
gelatin solution. Coated 4 more wells with vitronectin (1.5ug/cm^2) and then
incubated plate at 37˚C.

  1. Time when all vessels(s) placed into the incubator      9 : 19  am 

3\. Aliquotted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then
placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath for a minimum of 20 minutes
prior to use:

  1. TrypLE:     16    mL in     1    tubes    9 : 28  am   

  2.  dPBS (for washing and neutralising):     38    mL in   1     tubes    9 : 28  am   

  3. Growth media (for pellet resuspension and counts):     800 uL for each condition    in    6   tubes     10:05   am   

Note: if aliquots were placed in water bath at different time, record the time
stamp for each individual solution.




4\. Removed vessel(s) from the incubator   ~9:40

5\. Washed the vessel(s) with dPBS (warmed).

6\. Added   3      mL tryple to each vessel/well and incubated at 37˚C.

  1. Start/Finish for TrypLE was    9:50 - 10:05 for serum, 9:50-10:15 for ACF conditions 

7\. Neutralised with     3mL     dPBS and collected cell suspension into a
1   tube for each condition.

8\. Centrifuged at 650 x g for 5 min.

  1. Start/Finish time for centrifugation was    10 :28 - 10:33   am 




9\. Aspirated the supernatant(s).

10\. Resuspended pellet(s) in

        0.2    mL media for conditions 1, 2, 3, and 5 

       0.1    mL media for conditions 4 and 6   

11\. Aliquoted       10 uL   of resuspended cells into a microcentrifuge tube
for cell count.

12\. Performed a cell count using the haemocytometer and recorded the cell
count data in the Google Doc spreadsheet called 'Cell Count Spreadsheet' (see
link below):

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1DPzKubYxfHmWogVPihC-
SSIBtIylyrBQE5kRX5Z8NtI/edit#gid=0

  1.  Total cell number was:   
    1. condition 1:     73 600      

    2. condition 2:     29 600      

    3. condition 3:     48 000     

    4. condition 4:     2 000      

    5. condition 5:     10 400      

    6. condition 6:    1 200     
  2. Volume of cell suspension required for subculture was:  
    * condition 1:     5.16 uL (1900 cells)      

    * condition 2:     12.84 uL (1900 cells)     

    * condition 3:     7.92 uL (1900 cells    

    * condition 4:     95 uL (1900 cells)     

    * condition 5:     91 uL (4750 cells)     

    * condition 6:    100uL (all of the suspension, cell number too low to seed 1900 cells)    
  3. Cell density per vessel:      see table above      




13\. Transferred        the required volume  cell suspension for subculture
into each of the pre-warmed      0.5     mL Growth media:  

14\. Transferred cell suspension into the wells of 24 well plate.  

15\. Left at RT in the BSC for 30 min to allow cells to settle     12 : 10 -
12 : 40  

16\. Transferred vessel(s) to incubate at:

  * [X]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (avian cells)

summary:

Passaged 6x T25 flasks into 1x well of 24 well plate each

observation of cells before passage:

Flasks will B8 media formulations seemed to have more cell death (There were
more dead floating cells visible in conditions 4,5, and 6). Condition 5 was
seeded at a higher density than other flasks (2500 cells/cm^2) but because of
the cell death that occurred, it wasn't overconfluent by day 3.




### Results:

  * Results were;
    * [ ]  As Usual (this is a repetitive task)
    * [X]  Unexpected because... did not expect so much cell death in B8 media formulations
    * [ ]  Need to be further analysed
    * [ ]  Other (.......)
