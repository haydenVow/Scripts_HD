Topped up media from 72L to 180L (added 108L)  

Performed by: CB/SR

  * In-tubing from palletank bag was connected onto the "non-sterile" end of a filter and the dip tube ending from the 200L bag was connected to the "sterile" end of the filter. Media was pumped from the palletank bag through the filter into the 200L bag as a safety precaution given one of the sample lines from the 200L palletank bag accidentally came off, potentially compromising the sterility of the media contained inside.

Start time: 11:30

End time: 15:30

Pump speed: 10.0 rpm to start (this was gradually increased as the volume
increased), ended on 19.0 rpm  
  
New Method: Heated media with water bath as it was going into the STR200

  * Filled a bucket with water and Trigene
  * Heated water in the bucket to 60'C using a sousvide stick
  * Coiled up tubing on the sterile end of the filter and put it in the water bucket, making sure to avoid connections (with the exception of biowelded joins)
  * The pumped media through. (Could pump a little faster because of the heating)  
  
  
Media ID: M13175 (stored in a palletank bag since 21/07)  
Media type: 50:50 RPMI:CHOin1 (+glucose + L-glutamine)  
Filter used: Advantec PES Capsule Filter 0.2 um (Lot: 20408Z51-34)  
New Density: 221,334 cells/mL

Growth Factor mix:

IGF: 108 mL (M13176)

EGF: 21.6 mL (A12878, A12838, A12874)

Antifoam C: 10.8 mL (M12931)

L-glutamine: 1607 mL (M13186)

Combined all reagents in a 2L corning bottle for addition into the 200L STR

  

New Method: Used a 2L dip tube lid to attach to the STR200 tubing to pump in
the growth factor mix. This worked well.  
  
Growth factors pumped in at: 16:00
