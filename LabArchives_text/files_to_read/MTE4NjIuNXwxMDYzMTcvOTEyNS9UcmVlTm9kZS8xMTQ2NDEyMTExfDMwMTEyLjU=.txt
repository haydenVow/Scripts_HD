Prepare materials for thaw and seed:

  *  Pre-filled 3x T175 flasks with   30mL  OpriPRO + 4mM Glutamax per flask then placed in the incubator to warm and equilibriate >20min prior to use
  * Growth media (for resuspending cells):    5mL  OptiPRO +4mM Glutamax  




## Thaw and seed vial:

3\. Collected the cryovial from Liquid Nitrogen storage & place in foam
floater in water bath for 3 min

`4. Ethanol sprayed & transferred the vial(s) to the BSC.`

`5.  Added  500µL of Growth Media (to generate a total volume of 1.5mL in the
cryovial) to the cryovial, resuspended the cell suspension gently to reduce
osmotic shock. `

`6. Collected the entire cell suspension & transferred into 1x pre-warmed and
equilibrated  T175 flask (KHAKIO), or 2x pre-warmed and equilibrated  T175
flasks (MUSCO). `

`7. Returned flasks ``to incubate at: `

  * [ x ]  37ºC, 5% CO2, Incubator #77 Library lab.
