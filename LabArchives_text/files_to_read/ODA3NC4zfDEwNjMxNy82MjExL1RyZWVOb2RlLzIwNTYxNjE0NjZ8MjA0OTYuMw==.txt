Prepare materials for thaw and seed:

  * NOTE: IF PERFORMING A THAW FROM A CLONAL MCB_2 OR WCB_2, PREPARE AT LEAST ONE EXTRA 96 WELL PLATE FOR A DIFFERENTIATION ASSAY. THIS IS AN IMPORTANT QUALITY CONTROL STEP WHILE WE BUILD OUR CLONAL CELL BANK.
  * Suggested layout for diff assay (please refer to previous diff assays for exact seeding, feeding and analysis procedures)  

  * 

1\. Gelatin coated  1 WELL OF 1 X 6-WELL PLATE with sterile filtered 0.1%
gelatin solution and then incubated all coated flasks at 37ºC

  * Time when all flasks placed into the incubator  10:28 am 

2\. Aliquotted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then
placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath for a minimum of 20 minutes
prior to use:

  *  Growth media (for seeding):    2 x 3mL 
  * Time that aliquot was placed in the water bath to warm before use:   10:29 am 

  




## Thaw and seed vial:

3\. Collected the cryovial from Liquid Nitrogen storage & place in foam
floater in water bath for 5 min  10:53 - 11:01 am

Location where cryovial was collected from:

Vial details:  1 KUZCO20  cryovials at   ~1,000,000  cells each for a total of
~1,000,000 cells

3\. `Place vial in Beadbath: 10:53-11:01`

`4. Ethanol sprayed & transferred the vial(s) to the BSC.`

`5.  Added  200µL of Growth Media (to generate a total volume of 1mL in the
cryovial) to the cryovial, resuspended the cell suspension gently to reduce
osmotic shock. `

`6. Collected the entire 1mL of cell suspension & transfer into the pre-warmed
tube of Growth Media. `

`7. Using a 10mL serological pipette, resuspended & distributed the cells
evenly in the   3 mL of pre-warmed Growth Media (prepared in Step 2). `

`8.  Transfered  4 mL to the non-coated  6-well plate  well, allow to rest at
37C at RT for 45 min  11:07 - 11:52 am```  

`9. After 45 minutes, transfer the supernatant to the gelatin-coated 6-well
plate well and replace the growth media on the original 6-well plate (non-
gelatin-coated).`

`10. Allow to sit at RT for 15 min.`  11:55 - 12:10 pm```  
`

`10. Transfered flask/plate(s) to incubate at: 12:12 pm  
`

  * [ X]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (aviary cells)

  

Making labels

Note - You will need to increase the passage number by one. (i.e. if your
thawed vial ID has a passage number of 3, when you make a culture ID for you
vessel you will need change the passage number to 4 on Airtable.)
