Culture IDs to feed

Vessel ID(s)  
Vessel Type(s)  
  
7136-DOLLY12-Sheep P13-1of1  
48WP (scaffolds with inserts)  
  
7139-DOLLY12-Sheep P13-1of1  
48WP (adherent culture - no inserts)  
  
  
  







Process:

1\. Collected:

  * Foil-wrapped 48-WP from "Biomaterials" fridge in Main Lab labelled "LL SAT 48WP FEED".  
  * 15 mL tube from "Biomaterials" fridge labelled "LL SAT 48WP FEED". 
  * Placed tube in waterbath and plate in incubator (plate needs at least 30 minutes in incubator)   13:18  

2\. Retrieved culture plates and foil-wrapped media plate from Thermo
incubator. Retrieved 15 mL tube from waterbath. Ethanol sprayed and brought
into BSC.

3\. Using a well-ethanol sprayed hand, lifted HTP tray from 48WP with scafolds
by the edge and lifted into pre-filled 48-WP with warmed, fresh media. Moved
plate from original plate to new plate to keep labelling and culture ID in
place.

4\. Aspirated 250 uL (100%) of media from each well (A1 - A5) of 48WP with
adherent cultures (no scaffolds). Replaced with 250 uL per well from 15 mL
tube.

5\. Re-parafilmed scaffold plate and returned vessels to incubate at: 14:00

  * [x]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (aviary cells)

  

  * Incubator (#Thermo), Lab [Main/Library/Production]
