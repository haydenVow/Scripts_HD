Inspected the components

  1. Checked any "wetted" materials (materials that come into contact with the culture or additives and are therefore required to maintain sterility) for damage or residues that may introduce contamination (examples include seals and tubing).
  2. Checked any potentially dangerous equipment (e.g. gas regulators, gas lines, pressure release valves) for abnormalities that may lead to an accident.

Connected the liquid addition bottles to the bioreactor vessel

  1. Thoroughly wiped down the female STT connectors attached to the tubes that are attached to the bioreactor vessel.
  2. Placed the female STT connectors in the BSC.
  3. Removed the cap from a female STT connector with two hands
  4. While still holding the female STT connector in one hand, removed the cap from the male STT connector with one hand and connected the male and female parts together.
  5. Ensured that the correct male and female parts were connected.
    1. The SEED and FEED bottles should be connected to the extra-long lines attached to the 4-way addition port in the headplate
    2. The BASE bottle should be connected to a short line attached to the 4-way addition port in the headplate
    3. The HARVEST and WASTE bottles should be connected to the split line attached to the filter dip tube in the headplate
  6. Unclamped all of the lines after everything was connected.
  7. Repeated the previous steps for all female/male STT connector pairs.
  8. Removed the bottles from the BSC and placed on the trolley with the bioreactor vessel.
  9. Transferred the bottles and vessel to the bench next to the control tower.

microcarrier containing innoculum to the multiport, it will block the tube.
Instead, fill via the harvest tube  
  
  
  




    Fitted the liquid addition/removal lines into the peristaltic pumps

  1. Opened the peristaltic pump heads.
  2. Placed the tubing from each bottle in the respective persitaltic pump head.

    2. The BASE bottle line should be installed in the BASE pump head
    3. The HARVEST and WASTE bottle line should be installed in the SUBS-A pump head
  3. Ensured that the tubing was the correct way round as the pumps turn only in one direction.
  4. Closed the pump heads.
