Process:

  1. Labware definition was tested using a python protocol. X and Y offset needed to be adjusted slightly. Updated python protocol and labware definition are attached below as well as in GDrive.
  2. A water run was performed using a 3 well protocol. This took 5:58 min. However, it seems like there's a bug with the new software update where the timing starts at 55 s, so it's likely that the protocol only took 5:03 min.
  3. Added 2.5 mL of growth media to all wells of a new 24 deep well plate.
  4. Placed plate in the incubator (37 degrees, 5% CO2).




Observations/Summary:

Checked labware definition of 24 deep well plate. Performed a water run of 3
wells. Added growth media (without P/S) into a 24 dwp and placed it in the
incubator.
