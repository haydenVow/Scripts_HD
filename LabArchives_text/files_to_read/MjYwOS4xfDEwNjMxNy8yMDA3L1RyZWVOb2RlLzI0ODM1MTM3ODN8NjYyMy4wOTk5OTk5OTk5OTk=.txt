Aim/Purpose


To assess the effect of peptides and HDACs on the adaptation of fibroblasts to
suspension culture.


Hypothesis


That RGD/YIGSR peptides or HDACs will improve the transition of fibroblasts
from adherent to suspension culture.


Technical Gap


Suspension culture will allow a much higher cell density to produce food for
consumption which cannot be achieved with adherent culture. However, there is
limited published literature around adapting cells to suspension culture from
adherent, making it more difficult to get an understanding of which molecules
may facilitate the adaptation process.

A list of ingredients are being trialled out in 30-day periods to see if cell
numbers can return.


Method/Procedure


  1. Prepare reagents  
RGD peptide (10mM)  
YIGSR peptide (1mM)  
HDAC1  
HDAC2  
Note* not possible due to delay in HDAC arrival  
  
  
  

  2. Harvest cells from 2CF (Tuesday 22 June 2021)
  3. Seed cells into suspension culture at 8.5-10M cells per 50mL shake tube in various media compositions

  * DMEM/F12 + 20% FBS + 1X P/S + 1:100 Anti-clumping agent + RGD peptide
  * DMEM/F12 + 20% FBS + 1X P/S + 1:100 Anti-clumping agent + YIGSR peptide
  * DMEM/F12 + 20% FBS + 1X P/S + 1:100 Anti-clumping agent control
  * DMEM/F12 + 5% FBS \+ 1X P/S + 1:100 Anti-clumping agent (low serum)

  

  

  1. Every 2 days:  
\- Observe tubes for clumps/cloudiness/precipitate  
\- Centrifuge at 650 x g for 5 min at RT  
\- Aspirate supernatant  
\- Resuspend pellet in 1mL of respective media with a P1000 to break up clumps  
\- (on week days - collect 10uL for cell count + 10uL trypan blue)  
\- Top-up tubes with remaining 9mL of each respective growth media that the
cells have been in.  
\- Return to shake platform at 206 RPM.  
  

  2. Plot the cell count and viability over the course of 30-days.
