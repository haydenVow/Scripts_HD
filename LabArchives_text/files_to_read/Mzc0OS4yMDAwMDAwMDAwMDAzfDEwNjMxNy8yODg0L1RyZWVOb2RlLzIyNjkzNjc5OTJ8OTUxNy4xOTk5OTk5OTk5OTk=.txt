Prepare materials for thaw and seed:

1\. Aliquotted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then
placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath for a minimum of 20 minutes
prior to use:

  * Growth media: 30 ml  

  * Time that aliquot was placed in the water bath to warm before use:  9:50

  




## Thaw and seed vial:

3\. Collected the cryovial from Liquid Nitrogen storage & place in foam
floater in water bath for 5 min 10:10 - 10:15  

Location where cryovial was collected from:

Vial details: 1 at  1M  cells

Brew

Tower/Bucket #2  

Box/Cane # 2

Vial location:B8  

Vial ID(s):2296

`4. Ethanol sprayed & transferred the vial(s) to the BSC.`

`5.  Added  500 µL of Growth Media (to generate a total volume of 1mL in the
cryovial) to the cryovial, resuspended the cell suspension gently to reduce
osmotic shock. `

`6. Collected the entire 1mL of cell suspension from the vial & transfer into
29 mL of warm media.`

``

`7. Used this to seed 19 columns of a 384 well plate with 50 uL/well. Added
50uL/well of PBS to edge wells.  
`

`9. Transferred flask/plate(s) to incubate at: 10:38 `

  * [X]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (aviary cells)

  

Making labels

Note - You will need to increase the passage number by one. (i.e. if your
thawed vial ID has a passage number of 3, when you make a culture ID for you
vessel you will need change the passage number to 4 on Airtable.)

Summary:

Checked the wells of 384 wp that were seeded an Monday and noticed that they
had fewer cells than expected  (~10 cells/well).  So, they could not be
passaged to test different tryple times at room temp. Therefore, I seeded some
more cells at a higher density.  

Revived 1 vial of F_FOLLY12 WCB into some wells of a 384 wp in DMEM/F12 + 10%
FBS + 1x P/S
