Procedure
  
  
Test 1

  1. Took 0.5 mL sample from culture 7504 15:00
  2. Filtered 5 mL dPBS to remove any debris, A5618
  3. Prepared stain buffer:
    1. 1 mL filtered dPBS
    2. 20 uL NucBlue Live Cell Stain ReadyProbes Hoechst 33342, S3594
    3. 5 uL of Propidium Iodide, S1129
  4. Prepared 3 wells in a 96 well plate, each containing:
    1. 20 uL of sample from culture 7504
    2. 100 uL of stain buffer
  5. Prepared 3 wells in a 96 well plate, each containing:
    1. 10 uL of sample from culture 7504
    2. 10 uL of dPBS
    3. 100 uL of stain buffer
  6. Incubated for 10 minutes at room temperature in the dark 15:11 - 15:21
  7. Centrifuged the 96 well plate at 650 RCF for 1 minute
  8. Took phase contrast, blue fluorescence and red fluorescence micrographs of each well using the Zaber next to the incubators in the Library lab.
