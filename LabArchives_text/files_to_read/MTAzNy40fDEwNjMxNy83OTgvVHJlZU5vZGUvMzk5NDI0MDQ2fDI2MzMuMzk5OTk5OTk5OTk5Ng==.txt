Removed all 6 cultures above from the incubator to image [14:30]

  1. Took 2-3 images of each flask under the 4x objective on the primovert microscope.
  2. DOLLY flasks all appeared overconfluent (>90% confluence, see reference images)
  3. Noticed that flask 6630 did not contain the same phenotype as cells in other DAISY flasks. These cells looked similar in morphology and confluence to the DOLLY flasks. The reverse was true for cells in flask 6640. I suspect these flasks have been mixed up during labelling. (See reference images).
  4. Consulted with Tom about these issues. Made the plan to halt the DOLLY12_15D11 in this run but continue monitoring the growth of the DAISY4_16G9 cells in order to confirm their move to senescence.

No passaging or feeding tasks occured for these flasks today.
