Passaged the 20% serum adapted CHOMP cells into new vessels today.  
  
Cells were passaged as normal out of 2xT175 flasks (ID's 13119)

  1. Cells were washed with sterile filtered dPBS 
  2. Wash was removed and cells were covered with 10mL of sterile filtered tryple-EDTA per flask. 
  3. Cells were incubated for 30 minutes at 5% CO2 for 10 minutes. 
  4. Cells were collected into 50mL tubes and flasks were washed down with equal volumes of dPBS to tryple 
  5. Washes were also collected to the same tubes 
  6. Cells were centrifuged at 650g for 5 minutes to pellet 
  7. Supernatant was discarded and cells were resuspended in 5mL of growth media (mix13331, D/F12 + 20% FBS + 1xP/S) 
  8. 10uL of cells were taken in triplicate for a trypan blue stain at a 1:2 dilution followed by a count under a hemocytometer. (see cell count entry here https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1DPzKubYxfHmWogVPihC-SSIBtIylyrBQE5kRX5Z8NtI/edit#gid=0&range=2656:2659 )

Cells Count = 3,600,000, 3,740,000 and 3,640,000.

Average count = Avg 3,660,000 in 5mL

0.683mL of cell suspension (5.0x10^6 cells) was then seeded into a T175 flask
containing 30mL of growth media (Seeding density 7040 cells/cm^2, 1,232,826
cells total. culture ID 13145 to 13149

Observations:

When flask 13119 was inspected 2 days after seeding (4/8/22) the cell
morphology looked healthy. Cells appeared small, raised and triangular in
appearance. However there were a few cells that appeared flat and stretched,
with double the width of most cells.  Phase microscopy image of CHOMP07 cells
at P30 under 10x objective 48 hours after seeding

 When cells were passaged today the cell morphology looked less healthy. Cells
appeared very stretched and flat in some areas indicating onset of senescence.
Clusters of cell growth were observed between these flat cells, however I
suspect much of the flask area has been taken up by these cells.

  

Finding a way to measure this senescence in these cells and finding a way to
separate the senescent cells.
