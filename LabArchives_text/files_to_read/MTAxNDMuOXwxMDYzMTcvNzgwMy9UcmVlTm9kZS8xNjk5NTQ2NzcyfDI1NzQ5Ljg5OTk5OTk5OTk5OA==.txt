## Performed by: Bonnie  




Note

Due to the drop in cell numbers at todays count, conditions that were in 2x
E-125s (all except the YIGSR which was only in 1 flask), were combined into a
single flask for each condition.  




Process:  

  1. Aliquoted 110mL Nuvonis suspension media into a urine jar
  2. In the BSC, added 11ul EGF, 220ul FGF2 and 110ul IGF1-LR3 to the urine jar. 
  3. Placed in the water bath and warm to 37C 
  4. Collected vessels from shaker, and brought into BSC 
  5. Transferred contents of shaker tubes to 50mL tubes (cultures in the same media combined in a single tube for a combined count). 
  6. Centrifuged for 5min at 400RPM
  7. Aspirated and discarded 15mL media from tube containing culture 11852 (leaving 5mL)
  8. Aspirated and discarded 30mL media from remaining tubes (leaving 10mL)
  9. Re-suspended cell pellets in the remaining media, repeatedly pipetting with a 1mL pipette to break up clumps. 
  10. Took 2x 10ul aliquot from each culture and performed trypan blue counts (see counts in table below)
  11. Due to the low cell counts, conditions that had been split into 2x E125s were returned to a single E125, with only one of the culture IDs continuing (see table for details).
  12. Added 10mL of pre-warmed media from the urine jar to 11853 and returned to the incubator.
  13. Added 15mL of pre-warmed media  \+ 1.5ul YIGSR  to culture 11852 and returned to the incubator.
  14. Added 10mL of pre-warmed media from the urine jar + 0.5ul RGD to culture 11850 and returned to the incubator. 
  15. Added 10mL of pre-warmed media from the urine jar \+ 0.5ul RGD + 1ul YIGSR  to culture 11855 and returned to the incubator.
