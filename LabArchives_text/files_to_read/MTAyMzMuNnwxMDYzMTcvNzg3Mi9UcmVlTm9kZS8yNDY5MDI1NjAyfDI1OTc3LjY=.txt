Carrier Candidates


Hydrate and sterilize microcarriers

  1. Added |   g|  dry Cytodex microcarriers to a suitably siliconized (sigmacote) (non-stick) glass bottle.
  2. PBS (free of Ca2+, Mg2+) was added to the bottle (50 mL/g Cytodex) and the microcarriers allowed to swell for at least 3 h at room temperature with occasional gentle agitation. Final Concentration |     g/L | 
  3. The supernatant was removed and replaced with fresh PBS (free of Ca2+, Mg2+) (50mL/g Cytodex). Carriers were washed with gentle agitation for a few minutes by hand. 
  4. Carriers were allowed to settle once more and the supernatant was discarded and replaced with fresh PBS (free of Ca2+, Mg2+) (50 mL/g Cytodex) 
  5. Microcarriers were sterilized by autoclaving with steam from purified water, 121 degrees, 30 minutes. 
  6. Once the autoclave chamber cooled to approximately 70 deg C, the sterilized suspension was transferred to a BSC to cool completely.
  7. Once cooled completely, the bottle was orbitally shaken by hand to completely resuspend the microcarriers and a 1 mL sample was taken.
  8. The sample was pipet mixed and 10-100 uL was transferred to the well of a 96 well-plate for analysis.
  9. The number of microcarriers in the well was counted.
  10. The microcarrier concentration was calculated.
  11. The Stockyard label was created, including comments with the microcarrier concentration (in microcarriers/mL).
  12. The label was stuck on the bottle and the bottle stored at 4 deg C. Fridge # |   |
