Reagent preparation:

1\. Centrifuged the secondary antibody stock using the benchtop
microcentrifuge for 10 seconds.

2\. Prepared Secondary Antibody mix (pipette from the top/supernatant of
antibody solution): 12:08 pm

  2 µL   Anti-mouse IgG2b AF555  (1:500 ) +  1  mL Blocking Buffer (PBST (0.1%
Triton X + dPBS) + 3% BSA)  

If using AlexaFluor secondary antibodies then the max concentration should be
1:500 (typically used at 1:1000)

Pipette-mixed antibody mix and stored refrigerated away from light until
needed.

2\. Prepared Phalloidin stain: 13:28 pm

  2 µL   Phalloidin iFluor 488  (1:1000 ) +  2  mL dPBS

Process:

1\. Removed plate from fridge (incubated in primary antibodies overnight).

2\. Washed 3 times for 5 min with PBS at RT.

 11:56 - 12:01 pm

 12:01 - 12:06 pm

 12:06 - 12:09 pm

3\. Incubated the cells with secondary antibody mixture in the dark at RT for
1 hour.  12:10 - 1:10 pm

NOTE: from this step onwards protect from the light by wrapping plates in foil
and perform experiment in the dark.




Counter staining

1\.  Removed 2nd antibody solution.  13:29 pm

2\.  Washed with Phalloidin iFluor 488 (1:1000) in dPBS for 20-30 min at RT in
the dark.

  * Rows 1-4 (20 min in Phalloidin stain)

 13:30 - 13:50 pm

3\.  Washed in PBS 3 x 5 min at RT in the dark. (No Triton)

 13:50 - 13:55 pm

 13:55 - 14:01 pm

 14:01 - 14:06 pm

4\.  Replaced dPBS.

 14:06 pm

  * Rows 5-2 (30 min in Phalloidin stain)

 13:30 - 14:00 pm

3\.  Washed in PBS 3 x 5 min at RT in the dark. (No Triton)

 14:01 - 14:06 pm

 14:06 - 14:11 pm

 14:11 - 14:16 pm

4\.  Replaced dPBS.
