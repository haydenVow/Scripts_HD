The following flask which we've kept in continuous culture was passaged:

7508-F_DOLLY12-Sheep P10-2of2

This was used to seed 12x 10mm plates for a separate experiment (EPIC21185).

T175 flask was also seeded for continuous culture. 384 wp was also seeded in
case it is needed for testing cell tracker green staining or OT2 passaging
protocol.

culture IDs of the flask and the plate in order are:

7630-F_DOLLY12-Sheep P11-1of1

7631-F_DOLLY12-Sheep P11-1of1
