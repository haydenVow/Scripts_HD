Completing your EPIC

So, you have finished your experimental work, you know what your results look
like and you are just itching to start your next EPIC. However, before moving
on to the next EPIC it is important that you take the time to think about your
results: Did you prove/disprove your hypothesis? Did you make any surprising
observations along the way? What were the limitations to your EPIC and how
might these have impacted your results? What were the biggest learnings from
this EPIC? and, what were the key takeaways? All of these questions (and many
more) should be answered in your EPIC report. Without completing (and sharing)
your report the EPIC remains incomplete. In many ways the report is the most
important part of your entire EPIC!

While it is hard to be prescriptive with what a report should contain, there
are a few common points that all reports should consider. A report should
(almost) replicate the "Discussion" section of a journal article. The
following is a ROUGH guide with a suggested paragraph structure. PLEASE ensure
to include references to previously published work (or links to work conducted
here at Vow).

  1. What is the most important overarching finding? 
  2. A brief discussion of all results and how they fit into our final goal of producing an edible meat product (this section might be several paragraphs long and should put the results into the context of what has been done before). 
  3. Any limitations of the study, why might our results not be correct? 
  4. What is the overall conclusion? 
  5. Discussion of future directions.
