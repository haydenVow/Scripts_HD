## 50% Feed:

  1. Remove culture(s) from the cooling incubator. 15:02 pm 
  2. Look at culture under the microscope to check for cell death, contamination, and the confluence of cells/ aggregate formation. 
  3. Slowing aspirate 50%of the supernatant from each culture (in accordance with the below table), avoiding disturbing the cells/ aggregate formations adhered to the vessels.
    1. Please avoid opening and feeding multiple plates at the same time in the BSC, to prevent the spread of contamination between plates. 
  4. Slowly pipette 50% of the total working growth medium volume back into the culture vessel, as described in the below table.

5\. Parafilm the vessels to avoid spreading/catching contamination to other
cultures in the cooling incubator.  
6\. Return the cultures to the incubator. 15:40 pm

Location: 17-18C Cooling Incubator I Yurt Village
