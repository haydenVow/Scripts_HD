### Process:

1\. Took image of vessel with microscope on phase setting. Check that cells
are growing as expected (they will be on day 3 after a thaw). If everything
looks normal, you don't need to perform a cell count if you're short on time.

3\. Aliquotted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then
placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath for a minimum of 20 minutes
prior to use:

  1. TrypLE:     10.5    mL in    1     tubes
  2.  dPBS (for neutralising):    10.5     mL
  3.  dPBS (for washing):    10.5     mL
  4. Growth media (for pellet resuspension):         mL 
  5. Growth media (for seeding):     ~90    mL 

Time that all aliquots were placed in the water bath the warm before use
13:30   pm

Note: if aliquots were placed in water bath at different time, record the time
stamp for each individual solution.




4\. Removed vessel(s) from the incubator     14:26  pm

5\. Washed the vessel(s) with dPBS (warmed).

6\. Added     10    mL tryple to each vessel/well and incubated at 37˚C.

  1. Start/Finish for TrypLE was   14:34 pm  \- 14:44pm   

7\. Neutralised with     10 mL    dPBS and combined cell suspension into a
50mL    tube.

8\. Centrifuged at 650 x g for 5 min.

  1. Start/Finish time for centrifugation was    14 : 47  pm 




9\. Aspirated the supernatant(s).

10\. Resuspended pellet(s) in      1   mL          media     1500:   a/pm

11\. Aliquoted     2x50uL     of resuspended cells into a microcentrifuge tube
for cell count.

12\. Performed a cell count using the haemocytometer and recorded the cell
count data in the Google Doc spreadsheet: Cell Count Spreadsheet or cell count
widget below

  1. Total cell number was:        2,032,000     

  2. Volume of cell suspension required for subculture was:      0.45mL/flask       

  3. Cell density per vessel:    5934.86 cells/cm^2      




13\. Transferred      all      of cell suspension to the pre-warmed       60
mL Growth media:      15:20    pm

14\. Transferred cell suspension into      2x T175      vessel.

16\. Transferred vessel(s) to incubate at:

  * [X]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (avian cells)
