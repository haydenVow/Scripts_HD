Important info:

***The main plate to feed has cells in all wells - feed this plate with the
DSD media block with all wells filled with media***  
*** Each well is a completely different media condition - please change tips
for every aspirate and dispense!***

***A1 of media block corresponds to A1 of plate and so on and so forth -
please make sure the plates and media blocks are the right way up before you
start the feed to ensure the right wells get the right media***

Process:

  1. Remove DSD media blocks (main block and control block) from the fridge and placed in the incubator for 15 mins 10:00 am/pm
  2. Briefly centrifuged DSD media blocks (20 sec)
  3. Checked plates under Primo to ensure cells are healthy and alive. Please note in "Observations" the condition of the cells . 
  4. Removed  100  % of supernatant from vessel. 
  5. Replaced with   140 (per well/per vessel) of DIFF DSD  media. Each well is a different condition. Make sure to change tips for every aspirate and dispense with your multichannel.
  6. Placed sterile rubber mats back on media blocks and parafilmed to ensure mats do not pop off, then foil wrapped and labelled - and placed back in Biomaterial fridge for future feeds. Al
  7. Returned vessel to incubate at:  13:30 am/pm 
    * [X]  37ÂºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
    * Incubator (#  ), Lab [Main]




### Observations/Summary:

100 % media changed on vessel(s)

  

cells at good confluence, imaged a few wells

proceed to change to E6 conditions
