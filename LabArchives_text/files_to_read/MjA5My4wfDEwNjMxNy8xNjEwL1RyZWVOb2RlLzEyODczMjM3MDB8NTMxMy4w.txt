Process:

Growth media aliquot located in Library Lab Fridge 104 in Tube rack (40mL),
located in a 50mL tube labelled 'SUN' '4x96wp'  

4 x 96 well plates located in bottom Binder incubator 78

1\. Placed growth media aliquot in water bath   10:27 am

2\. In the BSC, transfer the growth medium aliquot to a multichannel reservoir
(reservoirs located on the black storage shelf at the back of the room behind
the pipette tips)

3\. Using the multichannel pipette, removed 100 uL of supernatant from each
well in the 96 well plate Using fresh tips for every well.

4\. Dispense the fresh medium from above the wells ensuring tips do not touch
the wells. Replaced each well with  100 uL  of   fresh growth  medium.

  * If any tips touched the wells then change the tips.

5\. Returned vessel to incubate at: 11:11am

  * [x]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (aviary cells)

  

  * Incubator (#78  ), Lab [Main/Library/Production]
