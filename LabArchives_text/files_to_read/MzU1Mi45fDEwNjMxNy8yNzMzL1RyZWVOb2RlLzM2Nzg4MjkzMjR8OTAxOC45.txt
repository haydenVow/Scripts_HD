AVIVA Systems Biology Protocol:

  1. 100 ul peptide (@4ug/ml) in coating buffer is added to individual wells of a microtiter plate. Incubate the plate for 2 hours at 37C or overnight at 4C.
  2. Remove the coating solution and wash the plate three times by filling the wells with 100 ul PBS-0.05%Tween20. The solutions or washes are removed by flicking the plate over a sink. The remaining drops are removed by patting the plate on a paper towel.
  3. Block the remaining protein-binding sites in the coated wells by adding 100ul blocking buffer, 3% skim milk in PBS per well. Incubate for 1 hour at RT with gentle shaking.
  4. Wash the plate three times with 100ul PBS-0.05% Tween 20.
  5. Add 50 ul of diluted antibody to each well. Incubate the plate at 37C for an hour with gentle shaking.
  6. Wash the plate six times with 100ul PBS-0.05%Tween 20.
  7. Add 50ul of conjugated secondary antibody, diluted at the optimal concentration (according to the manufacturer) in blocking buffer immediately before use. Incubate at 37C for an hour.
  8. Wash the plate six times with 100ul PBS-0.05%Tween20.
  9. Prepare the substrate solution by mixing acetic acid, TMB and 0.03% H2O2 with the volume ratio of 4:1:5.
  10. Dispense 50ul of the substrate solution per well with a multichannel pipe. Incubate the plate at 37C in dark for 15-30mins.
  11. After sufficient color development, add 100ul of stop solution to the wells (if necessary).
  12. Read the absorbance (optical density at 450nm) of each well with a plate reader.

Comparison of New ELISA Method With Established SDS-PAGE Method for
Determination of Muscle Myosin Heavy Chain Isoforms

Procedure:

  * 100uL of pAb added and incubated at 1h at RT
  * Washed with wash buffer (4X)
  * Incubated with HRP-labelled secondary antibody for 2h at RT
  * Washed with wash buffer (5X)
  * 200uL of TMB solution added
  * Reaction stopped after 15 - 45 mins by adding 50uL of H2SO4.
  * Read at 450nm.
