Whole team blockers:


Describe blockers here.

Discuss lab move - who can be here Saturday?

Discuss zaber automated cell counting - using new haemocytometer inserts for
the zaber - potential to save a decent amount of time following a harvest.
Propose we allocate some time to work on this, maybe grow up one flask
deidicated for cell counts - 1hr in lab with stanley to get this up and
running and then it could become a standard practise
