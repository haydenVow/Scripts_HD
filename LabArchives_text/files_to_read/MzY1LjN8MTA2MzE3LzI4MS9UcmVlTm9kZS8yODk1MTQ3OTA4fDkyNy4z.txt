  * [ ]  DMEM/F12 + 20% FBS + 1X P/S + 25ng/mL FGF-basic + P38i (10uM)

  




Prepare materials for thaw and seed:

1\. Gelatin coated  10  x  T175  flasks/plates with 15ml sterile filtered 0.1%
gelatin solution per flask and then incubated all coated flasks at 37ºC (min 1
hr incubation)  

  * Time when all flasks placed into the incubator   11:50 : 13:10   

2\. Aliquotted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then
placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath for a minimum of 20 minutes
prior to use:

  *  Growth media (for seeding):   300 mL in   1x120ml tube (aliquot available)
  * Time that aliquot was placed in the water bath to warm before use:   12:00   

  




## Thaw and seed vial:

  1. Collected the cryovial from Liquid Nitrogen storage & place in foam floater in water bath for 5 min  13:29   

  2. Location where cryovial was collected from: 

Vial details:  4   x  DOLLY12  cryovials at   540K  cells each for a total of

` `

  1. `Remove gelatin from coated flasks` 13:20  

  2. `Ethanol sprayed & transferred the vial(s) to the BSC.`
  3. `Added 500 µL of Growth media (to generate a total volume of 1 mL in the cyrovial) to the cyrovial, reuspended the cell suspension gently to reduce osmotic shock. (This is time sensitive).`
  4. `Collected the entire 1 mL of cell suspension and transfer into the prewarmed tube of growth media. `
  5. `Using a serological pipette, resuspend and distribute the cells evenly in the  300 mL of pre-warmed Growth media. `
  6. `Transfered   30 mL to each pre-coated   T175 flask/well, allow to rest in the BSC at RT for 30 minutes  13:58 - 14:28 a/pm ```
  7. `Transfered flask/plate(s) to incubate at: `

  * [X]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells) THERMO
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (aviary cells)

  

Making labels

Note - You will need to increase the passage number by one. (i.e. if your
thawed vial ID has a passage number of 3, when you make a culture ID for you
vessel you will need change the passage number to 4 on Airtable.)
