Background  
We recently established populations of embryonic Japanese and Bob-White Quail
cells. These cells were successfully expanded in a variety of medias in
adherent culture, including 2 serum and animal component free (ACF) medias.
These were DMEM/F12 +10% KSR as well as OptiPRO + 4mM Glutamax.  See lab books

In addition to adapting embryonic cells to ACF media in planar culture, some
of the isolated cells were place directly into an experiment aimed at direct
adaption to culture in suspension culture. See lab books here: https://au-

Unfortunately, our initial attempts at suspension adaption were unsuccessful.
In the current experiment, we will trial suspension culture of quail embryonic
cells, that have previously been expanded in ACF planar culture, rather than
transferring them directly from raw isolate to suspension culture. It is hoped
that this will reduce shock to cells, and give them great opportunity to adapt
to proliferation in suspension. A literature review was performed previously,

showing that all 5 of the existing avian suspension cell lines developed to
date, were cultured in low or serum free media, prior to being adapted to
suspension culture. It is therefore likely that this approach will give us the
best chance of success.  
  
The cell lines to be used in in this suspension adaption experiment are:  
BIRDK: Embryonic Japanese Quail cells, previously expanded in DMEM + 10% KSR
in adherent culture.  
BIRDO: Embryonic Japanese Quail cells, previously expanded in OptiPRO + 4mM
Glutamax in adherent culture.  
BOBBK: Embryonic Bob-White Quail cells, previously expanded in DMEM + 10% KSR
in adherent culture.  
BOBBO: Embryonic  Bob-White Quail cells, previously expanded in OptiPRO + 4mM
Glutamax in adherent culture.  
  
The 3 media formulations trialled in our previous suspension adaption
experiment will again be used here, as their ability to support avian
embryonic cell proliferation in suspension culture is supported by the
literature (see review previously mentioned). These medias are;

1\. OptiPRO + 4mM Glutamax  
2\. CDM4 Avian + 2.5mM Glutamax  
3\. Nuvonis suspension media
