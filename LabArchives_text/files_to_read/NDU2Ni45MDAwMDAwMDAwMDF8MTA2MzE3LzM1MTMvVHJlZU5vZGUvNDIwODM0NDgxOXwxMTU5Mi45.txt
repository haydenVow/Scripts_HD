Experimental Plan

D0: Thaw 1x vial of CHOMP9 raw isolate into 1 well of a 6-well plate in
DMEM/F12 +20% FBS +1x P/S . Incubate at 30C and 50% C02.  
D2: Gently mix media/non-adhered cells in culture 2. Perform a cell count (if
possible with debris) then remove half the media/ cells suspension and
transfer to a fresh 6-well plate (culture 3). Add 1.5mL of growth media to
each plate. Incubate culture 2 at 30C and 50% C02. Incubate culture 3 at 30C
and 50% C02 with agitation.  
D6 and every 48-72 hours thereafter: 50% feed of both planar and suspension
cultures. Perform cell counts on suspension cultures during feeds.  
Daily: Image cultures and observe for contamination  
  
Passage when 75-90% confluent.
