Growth Media:

  * [ ]  DMEM/F12 + 20% FBS + 1X P/S + P38i (10uM) (addition of P38i recommended by Bec)

1\. Gelatin coated 1   x   2CF flasks/plates with sterile filtered 0.1%
gelatin solution and then incubated all coated flasks at 37ºC

  * Time when all flasks placed into the incubator 11:00   

2\. Aliquotted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then
placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath for a minimum of 20 minutes
prior to use:

  *  Growth media (for seeding):    300mL in   1 urine jar  

  * Time that aliquot was placed in the water bath to warm before use:   11:55

## Thaw and seed vial:

3\. Collected the cryovial from Liquid Nitrogen storage & place in foam
floater in water bath for 5 min  11:15-11:20  

Location where cryovial was collected from:

Vial details:   2  cryovials at   500K  cells each for a total of   1M cells

Brew

Tower/Bucket # 1  

Box/Cane # 5

Vial location: C8 +C9  

Vial ID(s):2823, 2824  

`4. Ethanol sprayed & transferred the vial(s) to the BSC.`

`5.  Added  500µL of Growth Media (to generate a total volume of 1mL in the
cryovial) to the cryovial, resuspended the cell suspension gently to reduce
osmotic shock. `

`6. Collected the entire 1mL of cell suspension & transfer into the pre-warmed
tube of Growth Media. `

`7. Using a 10mL serological pipette, resuspended & distributed the cells
evenly in the   300mL of pre-warmed Growth Media (prepared in Step 2). `

`8. Transfered   300mL to the 2CF and allow to rest in the BSC at RT for 30
min  12:20  
`

`9. Transfered flask/plate(s) to incubate at: 12:50`

  * [ x]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (aviary cells)

  

Making labels

Note - You will need to increase the passage number by one. (i.e. if your
thawed vial ID has a passage number of 3, when you make a culture ID for you
vessel you will need change the passage number to 4 on Airtable.)

Summary:

  




### Results:

  * Results were;
    * [ x]  As Usual (this is a repetitive task)
    * [ ]  Unexpected because...
    * [ ]  Need to be further analysed
    * [ ]  Other (.......)
