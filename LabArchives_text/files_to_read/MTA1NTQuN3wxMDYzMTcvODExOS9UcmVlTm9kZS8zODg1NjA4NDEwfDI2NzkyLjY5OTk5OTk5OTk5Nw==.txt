Process
  
  
  1. Took 1 x 50 uL sample from flask 
  2. Performed count using ViCell. Count: 4,880,000
  3. Took 1 x 8.2 mL (2M cells) from culture and transferred to 50 mL tube 
  4. Centrifuged at 500 x g for 5 min 
  5. Re-suspended in 20 mL of warmed 50/50 medium 
  6. Strained culture through 40 um strainer and transferred back to E-flask 
    * Note: had to use old strainers with higher contamination risk, as we are still waiting on more of the new strainers 
  7. Returned culture to incubate
