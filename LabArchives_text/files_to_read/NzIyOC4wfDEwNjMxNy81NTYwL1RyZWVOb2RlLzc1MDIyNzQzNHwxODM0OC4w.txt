Background


A recent Mosa meat blog indicated their use of an f-actin (filamentous actin)
stain to demonstrate the cytoskeleton of their muscle fibers.

Snip from Mosa meat's blog showing their f-actin stain (Green), myosin heavy
chain (red) and DAPI (blue), demonstrating the cytoskeletal structure of the
fibers.



Currently, Vow has staining capabilities for immunofluorescence using
antibodies that will mark transcription factors MyoD, Pax7, MyoG and the
cytoskeletal protein marker Myosin heavy chain. Myosin heavy chain, stained
for with an anti-MF20 antibody, is commonly used to visualise myotube
formation. However, it produces a weak signal when conjugated to an AF555
secondary antibody. This results in difficulty understanding the cytoskeletal
structures such as striations seen along myotubes. Filamentous actin (aka
microfilaments) are proteinous components found universally in eukaryotic
cytoskeletons. In this EPIC we aim to develop a suitable fluorescent stain for
f-actin and assess its muscle-specificity.
