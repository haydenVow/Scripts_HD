1\. Prepared    4mL  PBST (0.2% Triton-X)

2\. Prepared    4mL  blocking buffer: PBST (0.1% Triton-X + PBS) + 3% bovine
serum albumin (BSA). (Kept in the fridge until needed in blocking step)

3\. Prepared Primary Antibody Mix:  7.5 µL   Primary #1 MyoG (Santa Cruz)
(1:200  ) +  30 µL   Primary #2 MF20 (DSHB)   (1:50  ) +  1.462.5  mL Blocking
Buffer

Vortexed antibody mix for 5 seconds and stored refrigerated away from light
until needed.

Process:

Permeabilise

1\. Removed PBS from each well.

2\. Added  100 µL PBST (0.2% Triton-X) to each well for 15 min:  15:51 - 16:06
pm  (#6597) 15:54 - 16:09 pm  (#6598) 15:58 - 16:13 pm  (#6599)  

3\. Aspirated PBST for each well.




Blocking

1\. Added  100 µL of blocking buffer (3% BSA in PBST [0.1% Triton-X]) and
incubate for 45 minutes - 1hr at RT. (no more than 1 hour):

  16:07 - 17:06 a/pm #6597  

  16:10 - 17:11 a/pm #6598  

  16:14 - 17:12 a/pm  #6599




Single/Simultaneous Primary Antibody staining

1\. Removed blocking buffer from each well.

2\. Incubated cells with 50uL of primary antibody at 4ºC overnight:   17:16 -
Overnight a/pm

3\. Parafilmed plates and stored at 4ºC in tissue culture lab Fridge.

After this step, all further task should be performed in a dark room. The
vessel should also be wrapped foil when not used.
