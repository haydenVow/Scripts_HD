Prepare materials for thaw and seed:

1\. Aliquoted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then
placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath for a minimum of 20 minutes
prior to use  

  *  Growth media (for seeding F_CHOMP09):   6.25 mL 
  * Growth media (for seeding F_CHOMP07):   6.25 mL 
  * Time that aliquot was placed in the water bath to warm before use:  13 :16   

  




## Seed F_CHOMP09 and F_CHOMP07 cells:

1\. Cells for this experiment were acquired from another experiment using
F_CHOMP07 and F_CHOMP09 (completed by BT, LL, and AG).

After cells were collected from the dua and thawed, they were counted and then
562500 cells of  F_CHOMP07 and F_CHOMP09 each were acquired.

2\. After the cell count, a cells suspension of 562500 cells (per vial) were
transfered into the pre-warmed tube of Growth Media.  
  
3\. Using a serological pipette, the cells were resuspended & distributed the
cells evenly in   12mL of pre-warmed Growth Media.

`6. Cell count total seeded was recorded in the Cell Count SpreadSheet. `  
  
`7. The time and number of cells seeded was recorded in the doubling
calculations spreadsheet. `

`8. Transfered 12 mL to each pre-coated  T75  flask (2 x T75s) `

Making labels

Note - You will need to increase the passage number by one. (i.e. if your
thawed vial ID has a passage number of 3, when you make a culture ID for you
vessel you will need change the passage number to 4 on Airtable.)
