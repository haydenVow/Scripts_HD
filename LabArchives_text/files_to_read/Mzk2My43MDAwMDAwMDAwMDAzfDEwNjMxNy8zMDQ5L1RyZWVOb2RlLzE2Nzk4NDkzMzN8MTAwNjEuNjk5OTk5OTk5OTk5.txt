### Process:

1\. Took image of vessel on Zaber on phase setting.

3\. Aliquotted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then
placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath for a minimum of 20 minutes
prior to use:

  1. TrypLE:      10   mL in      1   tubes
  2.  dPBS (for neutralising):     10    mL
  3.  dPBS (for washing):     10    mL
  4. Growth media (for seeding):      60   mL (for T175 flasks)  

Time that all aliquots were placed in the water bath the warm before use
10:20  

Note: if aliquots were placed in water bath at different time, record the time
stamp for each individual solution.




4\. Removed vessel(s) from the incubator    11 :12  

5\. Washed the vessel(s) with dPBS (warmed).

6\. Added     10    mL tryple to each vessel/well and incubated at 37˚C.

  1. Start/Finish for TrypLE was    11 : 18  

7\. Neutralised with      10 mL    dPBS and combined cell suspension into a
50 mL   tube.

8\. Centrifuged at 650 x g for 5 min.

  1. Start/Finish time for centrifugation was    11 :37 - 11:42 




9\. Aspirated the supernatant(s).

10\. Resuspended pellet(s) in     5    mL     growth     media

11\. Aliquoted     10 uL     of resuspended cells into a microcentrifuge tube
for cell count.

12\. Performed a cell count using the haemocytometer and recorded the cell
count data in the Google Doc spreadsheet: Cell Count Spreadsheet or cell count
widget below

Cell density per vessel:     7000 cells/cm^2  




13\. Transferred        2.72   µl of cell suspension to the pre-warmed
60    mL Growth media:  

14\. Transferred cell suspension into     2x T175 flasks       vessel.

16\. Transferred vessel(s) to incubate at: 12:05

  * [X]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (avian cells)




Observations/Summary:

Passaged 1x flask of T175 flask into 2x T175 flasks in D/F + 10% FBS + 1x P/S
seeded at 7000 cells/cm^2.
