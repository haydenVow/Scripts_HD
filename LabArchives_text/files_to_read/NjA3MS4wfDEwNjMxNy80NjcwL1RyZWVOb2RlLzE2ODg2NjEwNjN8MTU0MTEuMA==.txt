### Observations/Summary:

  ACF treated cells appeared to detach from the surface of the T25 flask.
Clumping of cells was also observed under the microscope. In comparison, the
control cohort (exposed to D/F_10%FBS+1XP/S) appeared to still be adhered to
the flask.  
  
To determine whether the detached cells were alive, 10uL of cells suspended in
the ACF media was aspirated and mixed with trypan blue to observe the trypan-
stained cells under the microscope. Microscopy revealed mostly debris and cell
morphology that is associated with dead cells.  
  
Further optimisation of the E8_10C media is needed to be compatible for
fibroblast growth and proliferation.
