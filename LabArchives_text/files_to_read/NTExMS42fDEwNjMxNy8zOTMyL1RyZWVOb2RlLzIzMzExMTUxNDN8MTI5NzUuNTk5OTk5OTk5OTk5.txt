Process:

Preparing BSA standard curve:

  * Make up stock of 2 mg/ml BSA solution
  * Perform serial dilutions to make up 2000, 1500, 1000, 750, 500, 250, 125, 25 ug/ml solutions of BSA. Place on ice.

Improved freeze-thaw lysis method:

  * Remove E6 from wells and wash multiple times with PBS to remove serum proteins that may affect analysis. Last PBS wash should be just enough to cover wells ( 200uL)
  * Seal plate thoroughly with adhesive foil
  * Place the plate directly in LN2 bath for 3 minutes.
  * Thaw in water bath for 3 minutes.
  * Repeat process 3 more times.

Cycle 1: 16:55 - 17:03  

Cycle 2: 17:04 - 17:12  

Cycle 3: 17:13 - 17:22  

  * Transferred lysate to 1.8mL microfuge tube.
  * Centrifuge tube/s at 650g for 5 mins. 17:27 - 17:32
  * Aspirate 100uL of supernatant and transfer to corresponding well on a fresh non treated 96 well plate. Keep plate cold by placing on ice.
  * Perform dilutions in the well plate using water or PBS (ensure that whichever one that is used is also used as the blank) as the diluent.
  * Parent, 1:2, 1:5, 1:50
  * In a new 96 well plate, add 250uL bradford reagent to the corresponding wells.
  * Add 5uL of the sample to each of the corresponding wells.
  * Mix well and spin plate down for 5 mins to remove bubbles (also the incubation time).
  * Read at 595 using plate reader.




Observations/Summary:

Limitations:

  * Foil sealing is working very well, hard to take off though
  * Used a microfuge centrifuge this time, saw visible pellet/debris after spinning down.
  * Abs for parent is in a very good range.
