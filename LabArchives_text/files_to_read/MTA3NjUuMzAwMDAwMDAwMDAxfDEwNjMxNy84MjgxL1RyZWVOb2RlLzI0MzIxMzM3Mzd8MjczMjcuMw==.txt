Primer pair master mixes used for experiment. New primer 10uM solutions were
made from stocks for this experiment, These 10uM solutions were then used for
the experiment below. Master mixes of each primer pair were made up for n+1
number of reactions in the table below.

PCR amplification using BENTOLAB

Removed a frozen cell pellet of CHOMP07 cells from the -20 freezer in the main
lab.

Thawed a 10mL aliquot of QuickExtract then resuspended the cell pellet in
200uL of QuickExtract mix. Aliuoted 25uL of suspension into 8 PCR tubes and
placed them in the bentolab thermocycler then ran the following protocol.

\- 65 degrees C, 5 minutes

\- 98 degrees, 120 seconds

DNA extractions were moved to the fridge in main lab at 4 degrees, labelled as
Wild type (WT) CHOMP. One tube of DNA extract was used for the reactions
below.

  1. Made up a master mix for reactions for primer master mixes outlined above (n+1).  Below are intended volumes for 1x 25uL reaction with the number of reactions needed for each primer set below. 
    1. CDKN2A reactions = 6
    2. NFKB1A reactions = 3
    3. PRCKD reactions = 3
    4. PLA2R reactions = 3
    5. BMF reactions = 3
    6. BCL2L11 reactions = 3
    7. FASLG reactions = 3
    8. RIPK1 reactions  = 3

  1. Obtained 0.2 mL PCR tubes
  2. Added 25μl of respective primer MM to each sample tube as per the table further above.
  3. Added 1μl of wild type CHOMP07 DNA extract to each tube, added 4uL of MilliQ to each tube to make a total reaction volume of 30uL.
  4. Took samples to the PCR machine and set the settings to (melting temp for primers used was 61 degress C).  

  5. To visualize PCR products, made up a 1 % agarose gel in 0.5X TBE buffer (1 tablet + 50mL of 0.5X TBE). 
    1. The following tutorial was followed for setting up the gel electrophoresis station on the BentoLab https://bento.bio/protocol/biotechnology-101/introduction-to-gel-electrophoresis/
  6. Ran the PCR products on the gel using 2uL of loading dye mixed with 5uL of PCR product. Loading order listed below

## Results

  

Primer combo P27 (5/4/22) and P28 (18/1/22) produce the desired banding.  
  
P28 (5/4/22) and P27 (18/4/22) primers Do not produce desired banding in any
combination.







## Observations

The Quick extract DNA sample used of CHOMP 07 was quite viscous, as a result
it was difficult to tell if 1uL was pipetted, some volumes of DNA template
added may be between 0.5 and 1uL.
