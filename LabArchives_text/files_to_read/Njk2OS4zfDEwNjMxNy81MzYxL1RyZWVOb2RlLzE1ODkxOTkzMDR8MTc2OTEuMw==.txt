### Process:

1\. Aliquotted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then
placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath for a minimum of 20 minutes
prior to use:

Growth media (for seeding):  

  150   mL D/F + 10% FBS  
 150   mL D/F + 10% FBS   150  mL D/F + 20% FBS

Time that all aliquots were placed in the water bath the warm before use
15:08

  




2\. Removed vessel(s) from the incubator

3\. Removed 50% of media (150 mL for 2CFs and 15 mL for T175)  
4\. Replace with 150 mL and 15 mL of pre-warmed growth media for 2CFs and T175
respectively.  
5\. Returned vessels to incubator 16:05
