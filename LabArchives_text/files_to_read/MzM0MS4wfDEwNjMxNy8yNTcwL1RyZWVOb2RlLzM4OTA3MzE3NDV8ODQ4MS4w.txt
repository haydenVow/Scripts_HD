Performed by Bonnie Tangey




Process:

1\. Place 5mL DMEM in water bath 10:45

2\. Placed shake tubes in centrifuge and centrifuge at 650 x g for 5 min at
RT.   10:59 - 11:04

Aspirated supernatant from each pellet

Added 1mL of DMEM to each tube and used a P1000 pipette to break up cell
clumps. Used P2000 to further break down clumps.

50uL of each culture taken for viability and cell count.

4\. Cultures discarded, experiment terminated.
