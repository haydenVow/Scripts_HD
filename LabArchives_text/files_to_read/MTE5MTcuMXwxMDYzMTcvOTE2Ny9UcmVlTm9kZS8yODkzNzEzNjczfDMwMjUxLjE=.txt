50/50 RPMI/CHO + 1 mg/mL yeast + 0.02 mg/mL L-Ornithine monohydrochloride &
Putrescine dihydrochloride + 1 g/L poloxamer-188 + 0.0005 mg/mL IGF + 0.0001

Main lab, incubator #86


Process
  
  
  1. Took 1 x 550 uL aliquot from E250 and performed count on ViCell
  2. Recorded counts in media results spreadsheet: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1cnmEz5amKSGmA9u3BJ-Dn0w-I7zFobBr6pG-UWCYaXM/edit#gid=595130609
    1. Cell count:  ( 1,570,000 cells/mL) 
  3. Discarded 44 mL of cell suspension containing about 68,500,000 M cells to leave 10M cells in E250 (200K cells/mL).
  4. Added 50 mL of warmed 50/50 RPMI/CHO Nuvonis suspension medium + GFs (with 3.4 g/L glucose and 0.435 g/L L-glut) so that seeding density is about 200K cells/mL.
  5. Returned flasks to incubator
