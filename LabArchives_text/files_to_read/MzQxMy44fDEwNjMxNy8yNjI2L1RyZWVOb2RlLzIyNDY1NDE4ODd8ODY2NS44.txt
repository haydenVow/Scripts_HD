2\. Aliquotted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then
placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath for a minimum of 20 minutes
prior to use:

  *  Growth media (for seeding):    3 mL
  *  Growth media (for feed):    3 mL
  * Time that aliquots were placed in the water bath to warm before use:  11:26  am 

  




## Thaw and seed vial:

3\. Collected the cryovial from -80C storage & place in foam floater in water
bath for 5 min  11: 48 -  11:53  am

Location where cryovial was collected from:

Vial details:  1   x  raw isolate (KUZCO20)  cryovials at   unknown  cells
each for a total of   unknown  cells

-80C freeze - library lab ID #64

Vial ID(s): 3045-Culture-7336-Vial-1of4

`4. Ethanol sprayed & transferred the vial(s) to the BSC.`

`5.  Added  500 µL of Growth Media (to generate a total volume of 1mL in the
cryovial) to the cryovial, resuspended the cell suspension gently to reduce
osmotic shock. `

`6. Collected the entire 1mL of cell suspension & transfer into the pre-warmed
tube of Growth Media. `

`7. Using a  P1000 micropipette, resuspended & distributed the cells evenly in
the  3 mL of pre-warmed Growth Media (prepared in Step 2). `

`8. Transfered  3 mL to each pre-coated  6-well plate well.`

`9. Transferred flask/plate(s) to incubate at: 11:57 am  
`

  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (aviary cells)

Making labels

Note - These cells are labelled as "F_KUZCO20" as we are attempting to allow
fibroblasts to adhere by not gelatin coating the vessel, and performing a 100%
feed 4 hours after seeding.

  

  

100% Feed:

  1. After 4 hours of incubation, culture removed from incubator. (7345-F_KUZCO20-Alpaca P0-1of1)
  2. 3mL of pre-warmed Growth Media collected and taken to BSC.    15:44  pm
  3. Entire supernatant was removed from 6-well plate well.
  4. 3mL pre-warmed Growth media added gently to the well.
  5. Plate returned to incubate at 37C, 5% CO2.   1 5:47 pm

Note* this feed was meant to be done at 4-hours, but due to writing down the
wrong time on my glove, I did this feed 10 mins earlier than anticipated.

Summary:

\- KUZCO20 raw isolate vial was thawed into 1 x well of a non-gelatin coated
6-well plate to allow for fibroblast attachment.

  

  

Need to be further analysed as to whether the sample was contaminated by a
microbe and to watch for cell growth and proliferation
