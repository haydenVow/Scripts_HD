### Process:

Below is information of the passage process. Refer to this when performing the
passage, however input data and timestamps into the widget.

1\. Took image of vessel with microscope on phase setting.

2\. Gelatin coated  vessel with sterile filtered 0.1% gelatin solution and
then incubated all coated flasks at 37˚C.

3\. Aliquotted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then
placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath for a minimum of 20 minutes
prior to use:

  1. TrypLE:  
  2.  dPBS (for washing 
  3. dPBS (for neutralising)
  4. Growth media (for pellet resuspension)
  5. Growth media (for seeding)

Note: if aliquots were placed in water bath at different time, record the time
stamp for each individual solution.

4\. Removed vessel(s) from the incubator

5\. Washed the vessel(s) with dPBS (warmed).

6\. Added  tryple to each vessel/well and incubated at 37˚C for 10 minutes.
Check flask under the microscope to see if cells have detached or need more
time in tryple.

7\. Neutralised with  dPBS and combined cell suspension into a tube.

8\. Centrifuged at 650 x g for 5 min.

9\. Aspirated the supernatant(s).

10\. Resuspended pellet(s) in 0.5 mL media

11\. Aliquoted resuspended cells into a microcentrifuge tube for cell count.

12\. Performed a cell count using the haemocytometer and recorded the cell
count data in the Google Doc spreadsheet called 'Cell Count Spreadsheet':

  1. Recorded total cell numberwas
    1. flask 7491 - 369 000
    2. flask 7519 - 735 000
    3. flask 7520 - 378 000
    4. flask 7521 - 828 000
    5. flask 7522 - ~1 419 000
  2. entire cell suspension was used for seeding for all cultures
  3. Recorded cell density per vessel
    1. flask 7491 -> T75 (4920 cells/cm^2)
    2. flask 7519 -> T75 (9800 cells/cm^2)
    3. flask 7520 -> T75 (5040 cells/cm^2)
    4. flask 7521 -> T175 (4731 cells/cm^2)
    5. flask 7522 -> T175 (8109 cells/cm^2)

13\. Transferred  cell suspension to the pre-warmed  Growth media (12 mL or 30
mL depending on vessel size)  

14\. Transferred cell suspension into T75s or T175 flasks  

16\. Transferred vessel(s) to incubator 18:02




Observations/Summary:

5 clones expanded from T25 flasks to T75 or T175 flasks.

cultures from flask 7521 and 7522 looked very clumpy when performing cell
counts
