### Process:  

Discarded PTEN adherent plates, suspension cultures have showed little
increase in cell number since seeding, therefore cells were de prioritized
from further experimentation.

The cultures involved in this passage are deemed at risk of contamination due
to an ongoing fungal contamination event occuring in main lab. They were
present in incubator 120 which contained cultures showing fungal
contamination. As a result the cultures have been quarantined in the main lab
to incubator 82.  

  

  

1\. Performed whole well imaging of adherent single cell sorted plates from
nucleofection Rounds 1-4 adherent single cell clones from 384/96 wps using the
Zaber, Phase imaging.  
PABPC1 - 384wp  
IGFBP4, - 384wp  
PABPC1 + PTEN - 384 wp  
ZIC1 - 96wp  
AQP1 - 96wp  
RIPK1 - 96wp  
  
It was decided that 12 wells (20 for ZIC1) containing clones of high
confluence (95-100% converage of the well base) would be passaged into new 96
well, adherent plates, with 1/3 of the cells for selected clones transferred
to separate tubes for QuickExtract DNA extractions.

3\. Aliquotted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then
placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath for a minimum of 20 minutes
prior to use:

  1. TrypLE:     0.02ml ( per 384 well), 0.05mL per 96 well)    
  2.  dPBS (for neutralising):      0.05mL per 96 well only, 384 wells would be neutralised in the destination wells   
  3.  dPBS (for washing):     0.02ml ( per 384 well), 0.05mL per 96 well)     
  4. Growth media (for pellet resuspension):         mL
  5. Growth media (for seeding):     0.2mL per destination 96 well (2.4mL per gene target)   

Aliquots were left at room temperature before use.




Passage was split between two people.  
Sarah passaging RIPK, ZIC1 and AQP1 plates (all 96 well plates)  
Nathan passaging PABPC1, PABPCA+PTEN and IGFBP4 plates (all 384 well plates)  
  
384 well plate passaging protocol.

  1. Removed the plates from the incubator
  2. Marked out 12 wells on the top of each plate that had been selected for passaging based on a review of photos captured earlier in the day. 
  3. Removed supernatent from wells due for passage
  4. Placed 50uL of dPBS in each well to wash
  5. Removed and discarded the dPBS wash
  6. Added 20uL of Tryple to each well and allowed the wells to incubate at 30 degrees, 5% CO2 for 7 minutes. 
    1. During this incubation time, a destination 96well plate was set up to receive clones from IGFBP4, PABC1, and PABPC1+PTEN plates. 200uL of growth media (DMEM/F12 + 20% FBS + 1xP/S was added to 36 wells on the plate, Colums 1-6, Rows A-F. 
    2. The plate was then labelled in the following way. 
      1. PABPC1 + PTEN = Columns 1+2 
      2. IGFPB4 = Columns 3+4
      3. PABPC1 = Columns 5+6
  7. Once tryple incubation had completed, 50uL of growth media from the destination well was added to the trypalised well, mixed, then transferred back to the destination well on the 96 well plate.
  8. The destination well was then mixed and 67uL of the suspension was aliquoted into a PCR tube for further QuickExtract DNA extraction. 
  9. Steps 7-9 were followed for the remaining passaged clones.
  10. The destination plate was then returned to the incubator at 30 degrees, 5% CO2 and the PCR tubes were prepared for QuickExtract DNA extraction.
    1. Quick extract tubes were labelled 1-12 as per clone guide below.

Passaging of 96wp

1\. Aspirated the supernatant and discard  

2\. wash with 0.05 mL dPBS and remove  

3\. pipette in 0.05 mL tryple

4\. incubate at 30 degrees for 10 mins

5\. spin cells down in centrifuge at 300g for 5 mins

6\. remove supernatant

7\. resuspend in 200 ul new culture media and move to new 96 well plate

8\. transfer 1/3 of cells in media to a 0.2 mL tube

9\. top up well with culture media to return to 200 ul total solution

10\. Place plate in incubator
