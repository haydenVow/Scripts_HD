48hrs after VitC Treatment Observations:

  * Unexpectedly, aggregates were present and starting to peel off the flask only 48hrs after the initial treatment

  * Different aggregate shapes present: 

  1. Very large, long, and thick 'worm/noodle like' aggregates (attached and free floating)
  2. Some large clumped formations (free floating)
  3. Some sheet-like formations

  * Some aggregates are free floating and some are still attached to the flask. Where the cell sheet has detached it is starting to roll up into a noodle formation 
  * Still looks like lots of cells adhered to surface  

  * Most aggregates are too long and thick to come out when pouring out media. 
  * But when pouring in new media, cell sheets come off the surface. 
  * For aggregates that did come out when pouring out media, they were sucked back up with a strippette and put back into the flask after media change. 
  * For aggregates that got stuck in the neck when pouring out, a stripette was used to push them down into the bottom layer of the flask after equalibriation following media change
  * Cell aggregates kept their shape and did not break apart from the force of the pipette. 

  

  

72hr after VitC Treatment Observations (Harvest):

  * All four flasks showed extensive, if not complete detachment of the cells into large white/straw coloured aggregates that resembled rings or donuts at first sight. 
  * 3/4 flasks did not have any other cell presence other than the aggregates and it was clear that all cells had detached. These flasks were therefore not subjected to TrypLE treatment 
  * The 4th flask (ID # 7478) had a mix of aggregates like the other flasks and some middle layers with a very clearly visible section of cells still attached in a monolayer/membrane that was opaque and appeared to be rolling up into the donut-like aggregates at the edges where it was detaching from the plastic surface. Upon manual agitation, the aggregated portions of the monolayer/membrane moved around in the media and either stayed anchored to the membrane or tore off the membrane section.
  * Due to the thickness of the aggregates, some got stuck in the flask when pouring out the media. Any pieces stuck in the flask were removed using a serological pipette by using it as a sterile utensil to scrape out the aggregate into the chamber/tube portion of the flasks (10CS's) so that they could be poured out with the remaining media or dPBS.

48hrs after VitC Treatment Observations:

* Same as In-House observations (above)

  * Observation with the Thermo incubator: A lot more aggregates formed in the flasks that were placed at the back of the shelf. They also felt warmer to the touch when taken out for photos. The 1 flask placed at the front of the shelf had the least aggregates formed. This flask was then moved to a different shelf towards the back of the Thermo incubator for better temperature regulation.

  

72hrs after VitC Treatment Observation:

* Same as In-House observations (above)

  * Due to obvious presence of cells still stuck to the flask TyrpLE was asses to flask 7461. As the flask was being equalised, it was clear that the stuck cells were becoming detached (almost instantly). By the time the equilising process was finished the layer had completely detached so the TrypLE treatment was terminated after ~1 minute and the liquid and cell matter were decanted into a sterile 500 mL container.
