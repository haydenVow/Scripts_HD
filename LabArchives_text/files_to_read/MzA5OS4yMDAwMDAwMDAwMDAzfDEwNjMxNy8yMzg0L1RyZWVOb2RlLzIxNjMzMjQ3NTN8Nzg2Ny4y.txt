Prepared to harvest the cells

  1. Placed frozen 500 mL bottle of Trypsin in water bath
  2. Placed 3 L of dPBS in water bath
  3. Placed ~0.5 L of growth medium in water bath
  4. Placed 50 mL aliquot of growth medium in water bath
  5. Once the Trypsin was thawed, transferred to BSC and added Poloxamer 188 to a final concentration of 2 g/L
  6. Returned Trypsin to the water bath

NotesThis step was not performed as the batch was aborted before seeding due
to failure of the pH probe  
  
  
  
  




Turned off the gas supply

  1. Turned off the aeration and any other gases.
  2. Turned all of the gas supply regulators to 0 pressure.
  3. Clamped the sparger inlet line

NotesMake sure pO2 control is off, then manually turn off each gas  
  
  
  
  




Harvested the cells

  1. Once the Trypsin reached 37 deg C (usually after 30 mins) stopped control:
    1. Temperature control MODE to OFF
    2. pH control MODE to OFF
    3. Dissolved oxygen control MODE to OFF
    4. Level control MODE to OFF
    5. Exhaust heater MODE to OFF
    6. SUBS-B pump MODE to OFF
    7. BASET pump MODE to OFF
    8. LEVELT pump MODE to OFF
    9. Air MODE to OFF
    10. O2 MODE to OFF
    11. N2 MODE to OFF
  2. Manual stirring at 90 RPM maintained.
  3. Pumped out culture medium to the waste bottle
  4. Pumped in 2 L of dPBS
  5. Pumped out the dPBS to the waste bottle
  6. Pumped in 500 mL of Trypsin
  7. Increased the stirring to 270 RPM
  8. After 10 minutes, added 500 mL of growth medium
  9. Reduced the stirring to 90 RPM
  10. Pumped out the cell suspension to the harvest bottle
  11. Added 1 L of dPBS
  12. Pumped out the cell suspension to the harvest bottle
  13. Stopped data logging

Recovered cell pellet and performed cell count

  1. Transferred 2 L of cell suspension to centrifuge tubes
  2. Centrifuged at 650 RCF for 5 minutes
  3. Aspirated the supernatants
  4. Resuspended the cells in 1 mL of fresh growth medium
  5. Combined the suspensions into 1 tube
  6. Washed down each tube in series with ~20 mL of fresh growth medium
  7. Gently combined and resuspended the cells with the wash
  8. Took a 10 uL aliquot
  9. Added 10 uL of Trypan blue solution to the aliquot
  10. Pipet mixed the cell suspension and Trypan blue, then performed live cell count by the Trypan blue exclusion method using phase contrast microscopy and an improved Neubauer hemocytometer.

Decontaminated bioreactor

  1. Added 100 mL of 70% ethanol to the feed, seed, microcarrier and harvest bottles
  2. Pumped the 70% ethanol through the tubing and into the bioreactor
  3. Pumped the remaining base from the base bottle into the bioreactor
  4.  ~~Cut off the tip of the sampling tube and discarded.~~ Not performed as the tube will be retained for another cycle
  5. Pumped 50 mL of 70% ethanol back through the sample tube.
  6. Disconnected and removed the pH probe:
    1. Wiped with 70% ethanol
    2. Rinsed with water
    3. Wiped with a lint-free cloth
    4. Filled the storage cap with3.5 M KCl
    5. Replaced the storage cap and stored the probe upright
  7. Disconnected and removed the DO probe:
    1. Wiped with 70% ethanol
    2. Rinsed with water
    3. Wiped with a lint-free cloth
    4. Filled the storage cap with tap water
    5. Replaced the storage cap and stored the probe upright
  8. Disconnected and removed the level probe:
    1. Wiped with 70% ethanol
    2. Rinsed with water
    3. Wiped with a lint-free cloth
    4. Stored the probe in a thickly-padded foam box
  9. Pumped the contents of the bioreactor into the waste bottle.
  10. Clamped all of the dip-tube lines
  11. Added bleach to the water bottle to a final concentration of 5 g/L sodium hypochlorite (0.5% w/v)

NotesDidn't remove level probe as it is too stiff to pull through the collar
in the headplate  
Didn't add bleach to the waste bottle as there were no cells sent to waste.
Also clamped off the 4-way addition port as it will be submeregd in the
detergent in the next cleaning step.  
  
  
  
  




Cleaned the bioreactor vessel

  1. Added pH neutral, non-corrosive, bacteriostatic cleaning agent to the bioreactor, filling all the way to the headplate.
    1. Add 20 mL of Sonidet detergent to 4 L of tap water
    2. Open the headplate
    3. Pour the water-detergent mix into the bioreactor
    4. Replace the headplate
    5. The level should reach the bottom of the headplate
  2. Left the stirrer on at 270 RPM overnight.
