Food Sterility Test - Quantal

1\. Batch 34 \- samples from 4 harvest tubes sent on 07/04/22

  * Belinda confirmed all 4 samples (Tube #1, #2, #3, and #4) showing mould, 2 different fungal colonies - continue with ID: Penicillium citrinum 

2\. Batch 35 \- samples from 4 harvest tubes sent on 11/04/22

  * Belinda confirmed 1 out of 4 samples (#155 incubator) had mould growth with same peniciliium morphology as Batch 34, therefore also assumed identification as Penicillium citrinum. [1 colony formed on DRBC agar after 5 days incubation].
  * Remaining 3 tubes were clear of any contamination (#156, #157, #158)

3\. Batch 37 \- samples from 4 incubator harvest tubes sent on 22/04/22

4\. Batch 38 \- samples from 4 incubator harvest tubes sent on 22/04/22
