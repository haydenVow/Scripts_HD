Process:

  1. Prepare the following reagents:
    1. 235 mL PBS
    2. 50 mL 4% PFA
    3. 50 mL 0.2% PBST
    4. 60 mL blocking buffer
  2. Set up OT2 deck as follows:
    1. OT2 filter 200uL tip rack in positions 10 and 11
    2. NEST 1x well reservoirs in positions 7 and 8
    3. NEST 12 well reservoir in position 9 containing:
      1. 9.5mL blocking buffer in wells 1-3
    4. NEST 12 well reservoirs in positions 4, 5, and 6 each containing:
      1. 9.5 mL PBS in wells 1-4 and 7-10
      2. 7.5 mL 4% PFA in wells 5 and 6
      3. 7.5 mL 0.2% PBST in wells 11 and 12.
  3. Run the following protocol: YYYY-MM-DD-num-N-fix-perm-block-3-plates
    1. start time: 11:45:23 AM
    2. run time: 3:13:23 hours
    3. had to pause protocol to remove liquid waste from reservoir on position 8 to prevent it from overflowing.
  4. Prepare 12mL of the primary antibody mix (anti-MyoG from Santa Cruz, 1:200)
    1. 11.940uL of blocking buffer + 60uL of Mouse Anti-MyoG (IgG1)
    2. store in fridge until use ~12:00
  5. Manually remove blocking buffer from wells and add 50uL/well of primary antibody mix. `13:41`
  6. Parafilm plate and store overnight in the fridge (4 degrees C). 16:00
