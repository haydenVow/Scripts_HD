Process:  

  1. Aliquoted 60mL of Nuvonis suspension media + 10% FBS (without growth factors) into a 120mL urine jar 
  2. In the BSC, added EGF and IGF1-LR3 to final concentrations of 10ng/mL EGF and 50ng/mL IGF LR3 to the urine jar to make up the complete media. 
  3. Placed in the bead bath and warm to 37C 
  4. Collected vessels from shaker, and transferred to the BSC
  5. Broke apart clumps in each tube using a P10 serological pipette, mixing until a homogeneous suspension was obtained. 
  6. Transferred the suspensions from each tube through a 40 micron cell strainer into a 50mL tube. 
  7. Moved the cell strainer to a new 50mL falcon tube then passed 10mL of the complete media through the strainer to collect any remaining cells. 
  8. Moved 20mL of the original strained cells into the tube containing the cell strainer wash. 
  9. Centrifuged cells for 5min at 300RPM
  10. Aspirated and discarded 90% spent media from each tube. 
  11. Re-suspended cell pellets in 10mL of Complete Nuvonis Suspension Media (including growth factors) and combined them into the one tube. 
  12. Used 10mL of complete medium to rinse out the empty tube, wash was combined to the cell suspension for a total volume of 30mL.
  13. Took 3 aliquots of 10uL from this suspension to perform cell counts.
  14. Performed trypan blue staining and manual counting with a haemocytometer, https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1DPzKubYxfHmWogVPihC-SSIBtIylyrBQE5kRX5Z8NtI/edit#gid=0&range=2733:2736
    1. Cell total = 15,440,000 cells in 30mL  
  15. Decided to aliquot the collected cell suspension into 3x50mL shaker tubes, 10mL per tube (~5million cells per tube) 
  16. Returned the cells to shake at 210 rpm in incubator 68, 5% CO2, 30 degrees.
