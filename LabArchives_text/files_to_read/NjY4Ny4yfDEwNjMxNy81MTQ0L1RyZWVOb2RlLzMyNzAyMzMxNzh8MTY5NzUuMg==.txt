Aim/Purpose


To track and determine the proliferative capacity of our CHOMP09 and CHOMP07
fibroblast cell cultures over a long period of time.


Hypothesis


F_CHOMP09 and F_CHOMP07 fibroblast cell cultures will survive for over 6
weeks.  



Technical Gap


The lifespan and proliferation rate of the crocodile fibroblast cells has not
been thoroughly examined. Literature on crocodile fibroblast proliferation is
quite limited.  


Method/Procedure


# Experimental Plan

1\. D0: Thaw 2M of F_CHOMP09 and F_CHOMP07 and seed each into 1x T75 flasks at
7500 cm2 (562500 per flask) in DMEM/F12+20%FBS+1xP/S (3/11/2021)

2\. D1: Perform 50% feed of:

  * 1 x T75s of F_CHOMP09  with DMEM/F12+20%FBS+1xP/S 
  *  1 x T75s F_CHOMP07 with DMEM/F12+20%FBS+1xP/S (4/11/2021)

3\. D4: Perform 50% feed of:

  * 1 x T75s of F_CHOMP09  with DMEM/F12+20%FBS+1xP/S 
  *  1 x T75s F_CHOMP07 with DMEM/F12+20%FBS+1xP/S (7/11/2021) 

3\. D6: Passage and count the 2x T75 flasks into 2 x T75 flasks. (9/11/2021)

  * Take 4x and 10x magnification images (2x per flask) prior to each passage
  * Record the cell count at the time of thaw in the cell culture doublings spreadsheet.  
  * Record the cell count at every passage (and the time it started) in the cell culture doublings spreadsheet.  

4\. Serially passage and feed when necessary until cells senesce or stop
proliferating.

  * Passage every 6 days (144 hours)
    * Remember to record the start time of each passage in the doublings calculations page. 
  * Feed when necessary (every 72 hours/ 3 days maximum)

Note: remember to warm media and incubate cells at 30o as these cells are from
a reptilian source.
