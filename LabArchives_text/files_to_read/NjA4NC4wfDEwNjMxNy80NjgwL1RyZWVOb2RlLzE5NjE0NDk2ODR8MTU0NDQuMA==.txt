Cell survival has been difficult to achieve throughout the maturation process
for primary skeletal MuSCs (muscle stem cells). Cells have been witnessed
dying in differentiation, resulting in many failed experiments (to be linked
here).

  

A paper published in 2009 describes an series of animal-component-free
maturation medium that allow cells to differentiate, mature and also maintain
high cell survival throughout the maturation process. In this experiment we
aim to recreate the medium in-house at Vow and compare the media to our E6
formaulation, to determine whether an upgraded media will allow for prolonged
cell survival. In this paper they achieved muscle maturation in vitro for >100
days in culture.
