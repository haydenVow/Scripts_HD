As we did not have the incubator space to run both expansions in parallel, and
CHOMP09 WCB1 reached our target numbers, this culture was terminated after 3
weeks in which it underwent 2 passages.  The average doubling time was 3.28
days, which is relatively slow however this is not surprising given we have
seen in the past that CHOMP cells take time to recover from a thaw.
