Excess cells were recovered from another experiment and it was decided to use
these cells on previously sterilised gluten samples. Link to

Samples were seeded as follows:

Prepare gluten samples in 96 well plate  

  1. Label 96 well plate: 
    1. Column 1: 100 min Gluten 
    2. Column 2: 130 min Gluten 
    3. Column 3: Autoclave Gluten  
    4. Column 4:
    5. Column 5: 100 min Wheat + Gluten
    6. Column 6: 130 min Wheat + Gluten
    7. Column 7: Autoclave Wheat + Gluten
    8. Column 8: 
    9. Column 9: 100 min Wheat 
    10. Column 10: 130 min Wheat 
    11. Column 11: Autoclave Wheat 
    12. Column 12:
  2.   

    1. Row a  cell free (control) 
    2. Row b - d - regular samples with cells  
    3. Row e cell free control 
    4. Row g - h dry heat samples 

Dry gluten sample: 1 hour 30 minutes

  

Seeding:

  1. Could only seed Row a - d. (dry heat samples not ready and not enough cells)
  2. Seed density of 1M cells per scaffold. Link to harvest: https://au-mynotebook.labarchives.com/share/Vow%2520-%2520Team%2520Science/Mzc1Ljd8MTA2MzE3LzI4OS9UcmVlTm9kZS8yNzczNzkzNTExfDk1My42OTk5OTk5OTk5OTk5
  3. Total cell suspension required: 12.7 mL 
  4. Centrifuge samples and removed supernate. - 14:47 - 14:52
  5. Re-suspend cells in 4.155mL growth media
  6. Seed cells with (1M cells) 150 uL cell suspension  
  7. Allow to rest in BSC for 30 minutes 
  8. Top with 100 uL of growth media in each well 
  9. Transfer plate to incubator
