Once images of whole wells were inspected and wells that appeared <70%
confluent were selected on a binary pick list, these lists were used to
generate multiwell picking protocols for the opentrons before passage. See
multiwell protocols attached and pick list documents for clone destinations
after picking.

Passaging of BMF+BCL2L11 clones.

Plates 12237, 12233, 12234 and 12235 were passaged using the opentrons based
on pick lists here

Destination plate for these clones were examined after the passage on the
opentron had concluded. No cells could be seen in any of the wells passaged
from culture 12234. Culture 12234 was inspected and the Tryple that was added
to each culture plate did not contain any cells for any of the wells passaged.
It is likely that the pick list for 12234 was innaccurate and that the wrong
image data set was used to generate the pick lists for this plate.  
Plate 12236 was also not passaged as a pick list had not been generated for
this plate yet.

Culture 12234 and 12236 will have to be imaged once again and passaged.
