RELATED TO MILESTONE:  

### KR2: Characterise 2 x QMS-compliant suspension-adapted fibroblast clones
from our chosen species

KR4: Establish and run a suspension pipeline at a rate of 10,000 clones per
month

AIM/PURPOSE: Perform a suspension SCC run of CHOMP fibroblasts using ultra low
attachment plates and/or coatings to prevent cell adhesion.

HYPOTHESIS:  Incorporation of low attachment plates and/or coatings will
prevent CHOMP fibroblasts from adhering to culture surfaces and enable them to
survive in suspension such that we will attain â‰¥1 clonal cell line adapted to
suspension.

RESULTS SUMMARY:

See final report

CONCLUSIONS:

Despite FACS sorting CHOMP_09 fibroblast into 384 ULA for cloning and
suspension adaptation, we were unable to confirm if the cell-like objects
observed after 24 days in culture were conclusively fibroblasts. Thus we were
unable to confirm the hypothesis. In spite of various shortcomings, including
Zaber imaging and hoechst staining these results highlight a potential avenue
for further exploration for suspension adaptation in static conditions. Whilst
the use of 384 ULA plates appears critical for this process, substitute
methods to track the performance of suspension clones across a certain time
period is highly required.  

NEXT STEPS:

  * Find alternatives to Zaber image scanning and hoechst staining in order to quantify the presence of cells. Suitable alternatives include live/dead stains with lower cytotoxicity or metabolic assays. See limitations section for rationale.  
  * Continue evaluating the effectiveness of several ULA coatings and semi-solid mediums such as agarose, methylcellulose and poloxamer
  * Repeat FACS sorting of CHOMP fibroblasts into 384 ULA plates to confirm this process is feasible in generating CHOMP fibroblasts capable of proliferation in suspension like conditions
