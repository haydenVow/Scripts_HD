Process:

  1. Removed the 4 aliquots of media for this experiment from 2-8C storage and placed them into the 30C water bath to warm prior to use.
    1. Time placed in water bath   09:30 am 
  2. Removed  100  % of supernatant from each vessel. 
  3. Replaced with  30 mL (per well/per vessel) of  matching  media. Please refer to the label on the flasks and the media aliquot to determine which media goes with which flask.
  4. Returned vessels to incubate at: 10:17

  * [ x]  30ÂºC, 5% CO2
