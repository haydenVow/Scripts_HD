Freeze down 2 x biopsy samples in LN for proteomics/genetic screening

Not completed yesterday due to uncertainty around sample sizes. Stored in
Library Lab Fridge (bar fridge above other bar fridge)

Biopsy IDs = (check main lab label printer) for: (from Biopsy #2)

  * 107-Arms/legs-15-Crocodile-QLD
  * 108-Arms/legs-15-Crocodile-QLD
  * 109-Arms/legs-15-Crocodile-QLD

Collect the biopsy chunk for proteomics (Biopsy #2), cut it up into 3 pieces
with sterile scissors.

Squish those pieces into cryovials (labelled with above labels), and then
flash-freeze those submerged in LN.  

  

Repeat for the genomics samples: (from Biopsy #3)

  * 110-Arms/legs-15-Crocodile-QLD
  * 111-Arms/legs-15-Crocodile-QLD  

  * 112-Arms/legs-15-Crocodile-QLD

(one frozen in liquid nitrogen for metabolomics/proteomics, one frozen in
liquid nitrogen for genomics)

  

Stored at -80c in a
