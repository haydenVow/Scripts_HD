Experimental overview


Introduction: Based on previous data using MMCs, substantial amounts of ECM
were present in the media, rather than the cell layer. The objective of MMC is
to concentrate collagenous matrix/ECM into the growing cell sheet to create a
harvestable solid product. We hypothesised that the continuous perfusion of
the roller bottle format was acting to dilute secreted proteins, thereby
diminishing the effect of MMC.

Objective: Compare the effects of an MMC combination on cells in a perfused
environment (roller bottles) vs a static environment (Cell Factories/flasks).

Methodology: Cells were seeded in roller bottles and 10 CFs under comparable
conditions:

  * 1 Billion cells per vessel
  * ACF media (DMEM/F12 50:50) with 150ug/L ascorbate, penicillin/streptomycin, ITS and BSA (18g/L)
  * MMC media as above, with x 75g/L ficoll 70; 50g/L ficoll 400 and 70mg/L carageenan.

Protocol:

  1. Four collection bottles (large centrifuge tubes) were weighed to 1mg
  2. Cells were harvested from a 5000ml E-Flask by pipetting equal volumes cell suspension into the collection tubes, and centrifuged for 5m at 500g.
  3. Cell pellets were weighed in the bottle to give a total cell mass per condition.
  4. Pellets were resuspended in 50ml DMEM (+20% FCS) and the volume of the pellet measured using the pipette graduations
  5. 2x resuspended pellets (A & B) were transferred to 2L roller bottles with an additional 175ml media (225ml total) and incubated under standard conditions for 24h, with roller bottles set to 1rpm. 
  6. 2x resuspended pellets (C & D) were transferred to T175 flasks, by transferring 10ml suspension to each flask and adding a further 35ml media (45ml media in total per flask)
  7. Cultures were observed for 5 days, with external visual monitoring to check changes in opacity and phenol red-indicated pH to determine the end point. 

Analysis: The key output for this experiment was to compare to amount of
matrix produced by the cells under each condition.

  1. Cell pellets weighed at the start of the experiment prior to seeding (time point zero; T0) and the total harvest mass from each condition weighed after centrifugation.
  2. Collagen in both solid and waste media phases quantified using the SirCol assay

Results:

  1. Cell pellet starting weights were recorded in Table 1. The average cell mass per billion cells was determined as 6.667g (SD=0.073g, n=4). The average cell volume was 6.6ml per billion cells.
  2. Total cells in each group were estimates to be 971M based on a 4-way split of 3.884Bn cells in 1200ml media.
  3. After 5 days it was noticed that the cell layers in flasks were detaching and media was very yellow. The roller bottle media was still pink. The experiment was terminated after 5 days and analysed
  4. The recovered cell mass was lower than the starting mass in all cases table 1)

Conclusions, summary and next steps

  1. Seeding at this density is excessive as a monolayer, and caused detachment and rapid media exhaustion. 
  2. The static T-flask format seemed to perform better, as cells in roller bottles formed aggregates
  3. Next steps are to trial much lower cell seeding densities and a 3D format for roller bottle cultures
