Summary

1 vial of C2C2 cells was purchased from Cell Bank Australia. C2C12 cell are a
well characterised immortalized mouse myoblast cell line which will be used at
Vow as a positive control for the expression of myogenic markers such as MyoG
and MF20 and for validating our Elisa pipeline. In order to ensure we have
ample stocks for future use, the C2C12s were expanded to MCBs and WCBs.

The purchased vial (containing 5M cells) of C2C12 cells from Cell Bank
Australia was thawed and expanded for 2 days before being banked as MBS. A
total of 24 vials, with 500k cells per vial were banked as MCB's.

The following week, 2 MCB vials of C2C12s (1M total) were thawed and expanded
for 5 days during which time they underwent 1 passage. After 5 days of
expansion, 58M cells were harvested. The decision was made to bank 51 vials of
cells and discard the remaining as we did not predict needing a large number
of WCB, and because we only had a limited volume of cryostor reagent in stock.  

The table below represents total cell stocks at the time of expansion
completion.
