###  




Process:

  1. Aliquoted growth media as follows:
    1. 35 mL of serum control media
      * Placed in water bath    14:00       

  2. Prepared stain buffer in 15 mL tube by combining the following (1 drop of each stain solution per 1 mL of dPBS):
    * 3 mL of dPBS 
    * 6 drops of NucBlue Live Cell Stain ReadyProbes Hoechst 33342
    * 3 drops of NucGreen Dead 488 Cell Stain ReadyProbes Sytox Green
      * Vortexted mix for ~5 seconds, then stored in dark until ready to use.             

  
E-125 flasks

  1. Collected E125s from shaker, wiped with ethanol-sprayed Rediwipe, and brought into BSC 14:15
  2. Using a 25 mL serelogical pipette, gently pipette-mixed culture for 1 minute to break up cell clumps
  3. Pipette suspension though 70 um cell strainer into 3 x 50 mL tubes. Kept E125 vessels in BSC, as culture will be returned to this vessel after feed. 
  4. Centrifuged 50 mL tubes at 300 x g for 5 min. 14:25-14:30
  5. Aspirated   100% (30 mL) of supernatant, taking extra care to not disrupt or aspirate pellet 
  6. Added   30 mL of fresh, warmed growth media to each 50 mL tube
  7. Gently pipette-mixed cultures using serelogical, before moving cell suspension back to E125s
  8. Took 100 uL samples from each culture and stored in separate microtubes until ready to stain alongside 50 mL shake tubes.
  9. Returned E125s to incubator.    14:40

### Staining Process for cell count

See lab book for staining process: https://au-

  1.  ~~Added 100 uL samples from 6-WPs and E-flasks to staining buffer in 96WP and performed serial dilution by hand to achieve a 12.5% final dilution~~  performed by OT2 ~~  
~~

  2. Added culture IDs to plate map above
  3. Incubated culture in stain at RT in dark for 20 - 30 minutes  12:23 - 13:01 (Centrifuge was being used by production - kept missing window)
  4. Diluted to 12.5% in dPBS, then moved 100 uL to empty wells for imaging
  5. Centrifuged the 96-well plate at 650 RCF for 1 minute. Timestamp:  1     
  6. Took whole well micrographs using the Zaber microscope on blue & green fluorescence channels (DAPI & 488) 
    * Culture ID images were stored under:    8029     

  7. Counted total cells (blue fluorescent nuclei, stained with Hoechst33342) and dead cells (green fluorescent nuclei, stained with Sytox green)
