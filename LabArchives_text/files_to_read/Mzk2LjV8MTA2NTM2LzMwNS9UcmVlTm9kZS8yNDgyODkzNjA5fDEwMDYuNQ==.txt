Experiment Plan:

  




Procedure - 100% Treatment with VitC

  1. Turn on the water bath and set to 37'C.
  2. Aliquot required growth media into a sterile container/s and add Vitamin C (aka LAA2P) [stock concentration 100mg/mL] to a working concentration of 50ug/mL in growth media i.e. 500uL per 1L of media.
  3. Place in the water bath and heat for at least 20 minutes. 
  4. Transfer flasks to the BSC, wiping with 70% EtOH. Discard media from the flask. 
  5. Replace selected flasks (Sets 4 and 5) with Treated media. Return to incubate and note the Flask ID. 

  

  




All flasks were imaged and observed for peeling or confluence.  
  
Set 5 (vit C seed) were all peeling. Interesting they all started peeling from
the bottom left, suggesting cells reach a 'critical' confluence and begin to
peel as cells were most confluent at the bottom left (I believe the shelves
are slanted slightly this direction). They are all still adhered though and
the cells at the top of the flask are at 100% confluence. Since the cells have
not completely peeled off, the will be harvest tomorrow to observe if they
fully come off.

Set 2 (pre-confluence vit C) were all at 100% confluence at the bottom half of
the flasks and between 70-90% at the top of the flask. No peeling visible yet.

Set 1, 3 and 4, were variable confluence, with all at 100% confluence at the
bottom half of the flasks and about 70-80% at the top of the flask. Therefore
it was decided that Set 3 (at confluence) would be treated tomorrow, and Set 4
(post-confluence)  on Monday.

Therefore, no feeds will be conducted today (26/08/21) and instead all flasks
will be fed/treated tomorrow (27/08/21).
