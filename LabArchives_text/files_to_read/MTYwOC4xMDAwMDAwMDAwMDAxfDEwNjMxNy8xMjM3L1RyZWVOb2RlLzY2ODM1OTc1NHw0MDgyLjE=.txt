## Feed performed by: Bec Screnci  




Growth Media:

  * [X ]  DMEM/F12 + 20% FBS + 1X P/S
  * [X ]  DMEM/F12 + 20% FBS + 1X P/S + 1:100 Anti-clumping agent
  * [X ]  DMEM/F12 + 20% FBS + 1X P/S + 1:500 Anti-clumping agent
  * [X ]  DMEM/F12 + 20% FBS + 1X P/S + 1:100 RevitaCell




Process:

1\. Place the pre-aliquotted  10 mL  mL of each respective type of Growth
Media into the water bath  10:30 am

2\. Placed shake tubes in centrifuge and centrifuge at 650 x g for 5 min at
RT. 10:46 - 10:51 am

Aspirated supernatant from each pellet

Added 1mL of respective growth media to each tube and used a P1000 pipette to
break up cell clumps.

REmaining 9mL of each respective media was added afterwards and triturated
with 10mL serological pipette to break up cell clumps for each culture further
and resuspend cells evenly.

10uL of each culture taken for viability check

4\. Returned vessel to incubate at: 11:10 am

  * [X ]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (aviary cells)

  

  * Incubator (#67 ), Lab [Library]

Observations:

Upon collecting the tubes from the shaking platform, tubes were observed.

1:100 anti-clumping - most of the supernatant was cloudy with cells and there
was 1 large clump of cell matter collected at the base of the tube

1:500 anti-clumping - the supernatant was slightly cloudy with cells and there
was 1 large and 1 small clump of cell matter collected at the base of the tube

1:100 RevitaCell - the supernatant was not obviously cloudy with cell matter,
and 1 large clump of cell matter was collected at the base of the tube

Serum control - the supernatant was not obviously cloudy with cell matter, and
1 large clump of cell matter was collected at the base of the tube

### Results

  * Results were;
    * [ ]  As Usual (this is a repetitive task)
    * [ ]  Unexpected because...
    * [ X]  Need to be further analysed (this will be graphed along with continual viability and cell count measurements over the course of the experiment to plot cell survival
    * [ ]  Other (.......)
