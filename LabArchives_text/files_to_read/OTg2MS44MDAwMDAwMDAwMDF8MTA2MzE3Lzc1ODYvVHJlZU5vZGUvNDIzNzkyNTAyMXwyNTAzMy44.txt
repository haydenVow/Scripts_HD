Protocol for DNA extraction was performed as follows (if frozen down as a cell
pellet):

  1. Add 25uL of quick extract (a10469) to each tube
  2. spin the tube for 15 seconds to get any loose cells into the quick extract.
  3. Transfer the 25 uL into PCR size tubes.
  4. The tube was subjected to the following heating protocol,
    1. 65 degrees C for 6 minutes
    2. 98 degrees for 120 seconds
  5. Tube was left at room temperature

Protocol for DNA extraction was performed as follows (if extracted DNA
directly from a cell suspension during a passage):

  1. 90uL of suspension culture was transferred to a PCR tube. 
  2. Tube was spun in a benchtop minifuge for 2 minutes (unknown speed)
  3. supernatant was aspirated and 25uL of quick extract (a10469) was added to the tube
  4. spin the tube for 15 seconds to get any loose cells into the quick extract.
  5. The tube was subjected to the following heating protocol,
    1. 65 degrees C for 6 minutes
    2. 98 degrees for 120 seconds
  6. Tube was left at room temperature
