Prepare materials for thaw and seed:

1\. Gelatin coated   6 x  T175  flasks/plates with sterile filtered 0.1%
gelatin solution and then incubated all coated flasks at 37ºC  (Note: 1 vial
is seeded into 3 x T175)

  * Time when all flasks placed into the incubator  14:33    

2\. Aliquoted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then
placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath for a minimum of 20 minutes
prior to use:

  * Seed media 1 (4 flasks): Growth media  (DMEM/F12 + 20% FBS + 1xP/S):    120 mL in 120 mL   tubes 
  * Seed media 2 (2 flasks): Growth media (DMEM/F12 + 20% FBS + 1xP/S) and add Vitamin C (aka LAA2P) [stock concentration 100mg/mL] to a working concentration of 50ug/mL in the growth media i.e. 500uL per 1L of media.   60 mL in 120 mL   tubes (30 uL of LAA2P stock added)
  * Time that aliquots were placed in the water bath to warm before use:  14:42   

  




## Thaw and seed vial:

  1. Collected the cryovial from Liquid Nitrogen storage & place in foam floater in water bath for 5 min  15:00   

  2. Location where cryovial was collected from:

``

  1. `Ethanol sprayed & transferred the vial(s) to the BSC.`
  2. `One vial will be seeded into and grown up in regular growth media and the other will use the altered growth media + VitC.`
  3. `Added 500 µL of each growth media type (to generate a total volume of 1 mL in the cyrovial) to one cyrovial, resuspended the cell suspension gently to reduce osmotic shock. `
  4. `Collected the 333 uL of cell suspension and transfer into the prewarmed tube of Vit C containing Growth Media.  
`

  5. `Collected the 666 uL of cell suspension and transfer into the prewarmed tube of normal Growth Media.  
`

  6. `Using a serological pipette, resuspend and distribute the cells evenly in the  60 mL of pre-warmed Vit C Growth media and 120mL of normal Growth Media.  
`

  7. `Transferred   30 mL to each pre-coated   T175 flask/well, allow to rest in the BSC at RT for 30 minutes  15:20 ```
  8. `Transferred flask/plate(s) to incubate at: 15:50`

Making labels

Note - You will need to increase the passage number by one. (i.e. if your
thawed vial ID has a passage number of 3, when you make a culture ID for you
vessel you will need change the passage number to 4 on Airtable.)
