media supplemented with hydrolysates (5g/L) during weaning of FBS. (a)
Fibroblast seeded in RPMI basal media. (b) Fibroblasts seeded in EMEMα basal
media. Serum control condition was cultured in DMEM/F12 and was maintained in
10% FBS during the weaning process.

Figure 2: Average doublings of DOLLY12 fibroblasts (mean ± SEM) seeded in RPMI
or EMEMα media supplemented with hydrolysates (5g/L) during weaning of FBS.
(a) Fibroblast seeded in RPMI basal media. (b) Fibroblasts seeded in EMEMα
basal media. Serum control condition was cultured in DMEM/F12 and was
maintained in 10% FBS during the weaning process.

  

Figure 3: Total cumulative doublings of DOLLY12 fibroblasts seeded in RPMI or
EMEMα media supplemented with hydrolysates (5g/L) during weaning of FBS. (a)
Fibroblast seeded in RPMI basal media. (b) Fibroblasts seeded in EMEMα basal
media. Serum control condition was cultured in DMEM/F12 and was maintained in
10% FBS during the weaning process.
