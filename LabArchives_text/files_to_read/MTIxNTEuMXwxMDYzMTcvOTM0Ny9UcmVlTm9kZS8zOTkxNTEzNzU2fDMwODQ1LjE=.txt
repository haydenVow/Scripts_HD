Process:  

  1. Aliquoted 20mL of Nuvonis suspension media + 10% FBS (without growth factors) into a 120mL urine jar 
  2. In the BSC, added EGF and IGF1-LR3 to final concentrations of 10ng/mL EGF and 50ng/mL IGF LR3 to the urine jar to make up the complete nuvonis media. 
  3. Placed in the bead bath and warm to 37C 
  4. Collected culture 13375 from shaker, and transferred to the BSC
  5. Broke apart clumps in each tube using a P10 serological pipette, mixing until a homogeneous suspension was obtained. 
  6. Transferred the suspensions from each tube through a 40 micron cell strainer into a new 50mL shaker tube
  7. passed 10mL of the complete media through the strainer to collect any remaining cells. 
  8. Centrifuged cells for 5min at 500g
  9. Aspirated and discarded 80% spent media from the tube. 
  10. Re-suspended cell pellet.
  11. Took 3 aliquots of 10uL from this suspension to perform cell counts.
  12. Performed trypan blue staining and manual counting with a haemocytometer, https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1DPzKubYxfHmWogVPihC-SSIBtIylyrBQE5kRX5Z8NtI/edit#gid=0&range=2790:2793 
    1. Cell total = 717,333 in 2mL  
  13. Made up the cell suspension to 10mL using additional prewarmed Complete Nuvonis Suspension Media +10% FBS (including growth factors).
  14. Returned the cells to shake at 210 rpm in incubator 140, 5% CO2, 30 degrees. Culture ID 13405
