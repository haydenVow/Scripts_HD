50% Feed on 33x10CS and 2x5CS


# Procedure - Feed

# Note: Fibroblasts do NOT require Gelatin coated Flasks, and do NOT require
p38i.  

  1. Turn on the water bath and set to 32'C.
  2. Aliquot  required growth media into a sterile container/s and place into the water bath. 
  3. Place in the water bath and heat for at least 20 minutes.
  4. Observe the cell flasks for confluence under the microscope using 4 x magnification and take images as required. Note: The confluence of cells must be <90% to perform cell feeding in P1-P3.
  5. Transfer flasks to the BSC and remove required volume of media from each flask (according to the Table below).
  6. Replace the same volume into each flask with the prepared growth media.
  7. Return the flasks to the incubators

Cell sheets in flasks have a strange appearance, almost cobbled/speckled.
Looking at the 5 layer under the microscope nothing abnormal can be seen, they
just look like normal highly confluent cells. The are starting to peel after
the feed also and the sheets look very thin.
