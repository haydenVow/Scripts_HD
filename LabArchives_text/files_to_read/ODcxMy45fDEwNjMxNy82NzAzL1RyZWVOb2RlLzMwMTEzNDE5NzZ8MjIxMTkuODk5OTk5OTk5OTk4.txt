Process

Terminating embryos at Day 9 of incubation  
3x Japanese Quail and 5x Bob White Quail eggs/embryos survived to Day 9 of
incubation.  24 hours prior to processing, these eggs were removed from the
egg incubator and left at room temperature. This would result in the caseation
of embryonic development, and the death of the embryos. As the standard
incubation period for quail eggs is 18 days, this marks the half way point of
development.

Isolation of cells from embryos  
24 hours following the removal of the eggs from the egg incubator, eggs were
transferred to Vows Yurt lab, inside the Vow building, where we are currently
processing all new biopsies. Here the following steps were performed.

  1. Eggs were spray liberally with 70% ethanol and transferred into the BSC
  2. Once air dried, each egg was cracked open, and into a petri dish.
  3. Entire embryos were then transferred to petri dishes, and their heads were quickly removed using sterile forceps. 
  4. collection jars containing FBS + 2% antibiotic-antimycotic. Embryos from each species were combined (3 x Japanese quail embryos and 5 x Bob-white quail embryos.

The embryos were then transferred into the library lab for further processing.
Here the following steps were performed.

  1. Collection jars containing the  embryos were sprayed with 70% ethanol and taken into the BSC. 
  2. One at a time, headless embryos were removed for the collection jars and placed onto sterile petri dishes.
  3. For the Japanese Quail, legs were removed by pulling them away from the body with sterile forceps. The femurs (which protruded from the legs once removed), were removed and discarded, while the remaining tissue was placed into a 50mL falcon tube containing 20mL of PBS only. Legs from all Japanese quail embryos were pooled into the same tube (cell line derived from these cells to be termed 'LEGGY').
  4. Following the removal of the legs, Japanese Quail bodies were combined into a separate 50mL containing 20mL of PBS  (cell line derived from these cells to be termed 'BIRDY').
  5. As the Bobwhite quail appeared less developed, with ill-defined limbs, the headless bodies were pooled directly into a 50mL tube containing 20mL of PBS (cell line derived from these cells to be termed 'BOBBY'). 
  6. For each of the 3 tubes (LEGGY, BIRDY and BOBBY), the PBS and embryos were mixed for approximately 2-3 minutes, causing the embryos to fall apart into a semi-homogenous cell suspension.
  7. Each cell suspension was then passed through a 70um cell filter, and then centrifuged for 5min at 300xg. The portions of isolation that did not pass through the filter were retained, to be plated into planar culture (see next steps). 
  8. In the meantime, T25 (5mL) and e-125 (20mL) vessels were prefilled with culture medium as per the tables below.  
  9. After centrifugation, supernatant was removed from each 50mL tube, and cell pellets were resuspended in 4mL of PBS. 
  10. For each cell line, 500ul of cell suspension was used to seed one vessel for each of the following conditions (no replicates).
