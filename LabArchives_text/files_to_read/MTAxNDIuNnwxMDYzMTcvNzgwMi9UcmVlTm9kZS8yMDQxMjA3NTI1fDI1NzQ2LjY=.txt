## Performed by: Bonnie  




Note

The culture containing Revitacell was terminated today due to the low cell
count.

When I arrived, the shaker was set to 210 RPM rather than 200RPM which was
presumably changed at the last count on passage. I have returned the speed to
200RPM today.

Process:  

  1. Aliquoted 80mL Nuvonis suspension media into a urine jar
  2. In the BSC, added 4ul EGF, 160ul FGF2 and 80ul IGF1-LR3 to the urine jar. 
  3. Placed in the water bath and warm to 37C 
  4. Collected vessels from shaker, and brought into BSC 
  5. Centrifuged for 5min at 400RPM
  6. Removed and discarded 8mL media from each vessel
  7. Re-suspended cell pellets in the remaining 2mL media 
  8. Took 1x 10ul aliquot from each culture and performed trypan blue counts (see counts in table bellow)
  9. Added 8mL of pre-warmed media to each of 11807,11808,11809 and 11810 and returned to the incubator.
  10. Added 8mL of pre-warmed media (+.8ul YIGSR) to 11478 and returned to the incubator.
  11. Added 2.0uL RGD to the remaining 40mL media in the urine jar. 
  12. Added 8mL of pre-warmed media from the urine jar to culture11479 and returned to the incubator. 
  13. Added 3.2uL YIGSR to the remaining 32mL media in the urine jar. 
  14. Added 8mL of pre-warmed media from the urine jar to each of 11811, 11812 and 11813 and returned to the incubator. 
  15. Transferred the remaining 8mL of pre-warmed media from the urine jar to culture 11481 along with 80uL Revita cell supplement then returned culture to the incubator.

Observations

Cultures containing peptides were very clumpy. The culture containing Revita
cell had flakey clumps rather than rounded ones.
