AIM/PURPOSE:

  * To investigate the effect of TGFb on inducing ECM deposition and tissue stiffening in Nuvonis tissue discs. 

  
Why? Including an aim gives your experimental design a purpose and prompts you
to ask yourself before starting the experiment whether your design does in
fact address the proposed aim.  

  * TGF-b showed some promise observationally, in terms of tissue stiffness and integrity. Mitogens like TGF-b will increase proliferation, while at the same time activating fibroblasts and triggering matrix deposition. Can we further increase the biomass and improve the texture with treatment?

HYPOTHESIS: Include a specific and measurable hypothesis. Phrase positively
e.g. ''DOLLY12 cells will adhere and maintain adherence of over 70% confluence
to nanofibrous gelatin and zein scaffolds after 14 days in ACF media.''

Tissue formation and integrity will be improved with GF treatment and the
metrics to answer this hypothesis will be:

  * Increase in contraction of the tissue disc (observational) overtime, with the contraction increasing dose-dependently. 
    * Measured by: by taking images daily (vow tablet) where we observe increased contraction overtime. 
  * Increase in biomass of the tissue disc compared to untreated control, and an expected dose-dependent increase in biomass with increasing concentrations of TGFb. 
    * Measured by weighing at the time of harvest. 
  * Increased regions of compact tissue-like regions when observing cell distribution and evidence of myofibroblast differentiation
    * Measured by microscopy and histological immunostainning and analysis.  
  * Consistent cell viability across conditions, with the highest concentration condition to have a detrimental impact on cell viability
    * Measured by quantifying the percentage of apoptotic/ dead cell population measuring using Flow Cytometry. 

Why? Writing out the hypothesis will encourage you to ensure your experimental
design will allow you to support/disprove the hypothesis, and to ask yourself
questions such as: Is there sufficient replicates to ensure statistical
significance?
