Process:

Aliquotted  500 mL  mL of  growth Media into 1x 500 bottle    (stored in the
main lab media fridge with '10-07-21 SAT feed' and '7343 and 7344' on it).
12:20 09/07/21

  

1\. Placed aliquot in water bath   11:17 a/pm

2\. Stopped the shaker and removed cultures from the incubator (top Sanyo in
main lab) before restarting the shaker   12:20 a/pm

3\. Placed suspension flask(s) inside the BSC and allowed to sit static for
3-5 minutes to allow microcarriers to settle to the base of the flask.

2\. Carefully removed  50  % of supernatant from the flask(s) by pipetting
slowly and following the meniscus with the pipette tip so as to avoid placing
the pipette tip near the microcarriers at the base of the flask(s).

3\. Replaced with  250 mL (per well/per vessel) of   growth  media.

4\. Returned vessel to incubate at:   12:37 a/pm , shaking at 90 RPM in
incubator #  81  

  * [X]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (aviary cells)




### Observations/Summary:

50  % media changed on vessel(s)

  1. Cultures were not shaking as of 12:20pm when top Sanyo was opened to feed flasks. Notified Tom via Slack.
