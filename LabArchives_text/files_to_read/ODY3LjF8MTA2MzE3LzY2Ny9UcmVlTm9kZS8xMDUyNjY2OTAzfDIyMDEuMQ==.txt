Growth Media:

  * [x]  DMEM/F12 + 20% FBS + 1X P/S + P38i (10uM)

  

Prepare materials for thaw and seed:

  * 

1\. Gelatin coated  6  x  T175  flasks/plates with sterile filtered 0.1%
gelatin solution and then incubated all coated flasks at 37ºC

  * Time when all flasks placed into the incubator   10:57 a/pm 

2\. Aliquotted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then
placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath for a minimum of 20 minutes
prior to use:

  *  Growth media (for seeding):    2x90mL in  2x120mL  containers
  * Time that aliquot was placed in the water bath to warm before use:  16 48: a/pm 

  




## Thaw and seed vial:

3\. Collected the cryovial from Liquid Nitrogen storage & place in foam
floater in water bath for 5 min  17:13 - 17:18 a/pm

Location where cryovial was collected from:

(2 x WCB_2 Planar to provide extra cells as buffer if growth is slow)

(2 x WCB_2 Suspension to provide extra cells as buffer if growth is slow).

Vial details:  2   x  930K   and 2   x  500K  cryovials at   K  cells each for
a total of    1.86M and 1M  cells respectively.

`4. Ethanol sprayed & transferred the vial(s) to the BSC.`

`5.  Added  500µL of Growth Media (to generate a total volume of 1mL in the
cryovial) to the cryovial, resuspended the cell suspension gently to reduce
osmotic shock. `

`6. Collected the entire 1mL of cell suspension & transfer into the pre-warmed
tube of Growth Media. `

`7. Using a 10mL serological pipette, resuspended & distributed the cells
evenly in the   180mL of pre-warmed Growth Media (prepared in Step 2). `

`8. Another 90mL was aliquotted for the 3 x T175 for adherent culture  
`

`8. Transfered   30mL to each pre-coated  T175  flask/well, allow to rest in
the BSC at RT for 30 min  17:42 - 18:25 a/pm `

`9. Transfered flask/plate(s) to incubate at: `

  * [ X]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (aviary cells)

  

Making labels

Note - You will need to increase the passage number by one. (i.e. if your
thawed vial ID has a passage number of 3, when you make a culture ID for you
vessel you will need change the passage number to 4 on Airtable.)

  




SOPs used:

  * Thaw/Revival Template_V3

  

Summary:

\- Each microcarrier derived vial was found to contain 930k cells and hence an
extra 3 x T175s were seeded making a total of 6.
