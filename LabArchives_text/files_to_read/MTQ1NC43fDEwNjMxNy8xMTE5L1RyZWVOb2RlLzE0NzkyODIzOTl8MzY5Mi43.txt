Transfer into new vessel and 100% feed




Perform feed using below volumes:




Growth Media:

  * [X] ACF (no mix ID as there are too many components - refer to lab book)
  * [X] DMEM/F12 + 20%FBS + 1XP/S + p38i (media ID not recorded)

Total ACF media required: 48 mL

Total GM required: 24 mL

Process:  

  1. Transfer   2mL  of media (ACF and serum) into each well of a new   48 well   plate. Place in incubator for up to 20 minutes. 1:45 - 2:17 pm     

  2. Using a sterile tweezers (autoclaved metal pointy tweezers), carefully transfer each scaffold over to the new plate.    

    1. Use a 50 mL falcon tube in the BSC to hold the tweezers and maintain sterility between use (easier than putting back into autoclave bag) 
    2. have the new plate side-by-side touching the previous plate during transfer, so if the scaffold drops during transfer it is likely to drop within the new sterile plate.
    3. when transferring scaffolds try to pinch a small area on outside edge of scaffold, do not fold the whole scaffold between tweezers as the scaffold is prone to break. 
    4. when transferring scaffolds in the BSC do so towards the centre of the BSC, when working too close to the filter the movement of air can blow thin/light scaffolds and result in scaffolds being blown away/dropped. Working too close to the filter is also not best practise from a sterility perspective.  

  3. Returned vessel to incubate at   2:26 pm  

  * [x]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (aviary cells)
