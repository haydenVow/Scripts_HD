Process:

Aliquotted   90mL  mL of  growth Media into  1x120mL     container(s). placed
the aliquot into fridge 105 on the top shelf on the door of the fridge  [16:20
a/pm]

2\. Stopped the shaker and removed cultures from the incubator before
restarting the shaker  16:27 pm

3\. Placed suspension flask(s) inside the BSC and allowed to sit static for
3-5 minutes to allow microcarriers to settle to the base of the flask.

2\. Carefully removed  50  % of supernatant from the flask(s) by pipetting
slowly and following the meniscus with the pipette tip so as to avoid placing
the pipette tip near the microcarriers at the base of the flask(s). (60mL for
the E500 flask, 30mL for the E250 flask)

3\. Replaced with  30 mL (6769) and 60 mL (6768)   of   growth  media.

4\. Returned vessel to incubate at:   16:35 pm , incubator #   68  , shaking
at 110rpm  

  * [x]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (aviary cells)
