Prepare materials for thaw and seed:

  *  ~~ ~~NOTE: IF PERFORMING A THAW FROM A CLONAL MCB_2 OR WCB_2, PREPARE AT LEAST ONE EXTRA 96 WELL PLATE FOR A DIFFERENTIATION ASSAY. THIS IS AN IMPORTANT QUALITY CONTROL STEP WHILE WE BUILD OUR CLONAL CELL BANK.~~~~
  *  ~~ ~~Suggested layout for diff assay (please refer to previous diff assays for exact seeding, feeding and analysis procedures)~~  
~~

 ~~ ~~1\. Gelatin coated    x    flasks/plates with sterile filtered 0.1%
gelatin solution and then incubated all coated flasks at 37ºC ~~~~

  *  ~~ ~~Time when all flasks placed into the incubator    : a/pm ~~~~

1\. Prepared growth materials:

  * CO2 free medium - Leibovitz's L-15 + 2% FBS + 1% ACA + 0.1% poloxamer 188 11:30  

  * CO2 growth medium - DMEM/F12 \+ 2% FBS + 1x P/S + 1% ACA + 0.1% poloxamer 188 11:30  

  * Ziploc bag  

  * Bubble wrap (or similar padded packaging material)  

  * Styrofoam box  

  * Identifying label - material contents, hazard warning (if any), date of preparation, person who prepared, sender, receiver, culture conditions  

2\. Aliquotted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then
placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath for a minimum of 20 minutes
prior to use:

  *  Growth medium (M6289 for seeding):    20 mL  

  * Time that aliquot was placed in the water bath to warm before use:   11:34 

  




## Thaw and seed vial:

3\. Collected the cryovial from Liquid Nitrogen storage & place in foam
floater in water bath for 5 min  11:56 - 12:01

Location where cryovial was collected from:

Vial details:  2   x  1 mL  cryovials at   10 million   cells each for a total
of    20 million  cells

`4. Ethanol sprayed & transferred the vial(s) to the BSC.`

 ~~` ~~5.  Added  µL of CO2-free Growth Media (to generate a total volume of
1mL in the cryovial) to the cryovial, resuspended the cell suspension gently
to reduce osmotic shock. ~~`~~

`6. Collected the entire 1mL of cell suspension & transfer into the pre-warmed
tube of Growth Media. `

`7. Using a 10mL serological pipette, resuspended & distributed the cells
evenly in the   mL of pre-warmed Growth Media (prepared in Step 2). `

 ~~` ~~8. Transfered   mL to each pre-coated    flask/well, allow to rest in
the BSC at RT for 30 min  : - : a/pm ~~`~~

 ~~` ~~9. Transfered flask/plate(s) to incubate at:  ~~`~~

  *  ~~[ ]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)~~
  *  ~~[ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (aviary cells)~~

  

Making labels

Note - You will need to increase the passage number by one. (i.e. if your
thawed vial ID has a passage number of 3, when you make a culture ID for you
vessel you will need change the passage number to 4 on Airtable.)

  

10\. Prepared sample as per this
protocol:https://www.bu.edu/dbin/stemcells/files/Shipping%20live%20fibroblast%20cell%20cultures.pdf

  * Tightened the cap and sealed with parafilm. Filling to the top is important to avoid the shearing forces of media swishing  
around in under filled containers.

  * Placed the vessel in a sealed plastic bag and wrap the bag in bubble wrap.
  * Placed the wrapped vessel in a padded mailing container or box, along with a piece of  
paper with identifying name/information about the cells.

  * SHIP AT ROOM TEMPERATURE. Do not ship on ice packs or cold packs. Most cells will survive for at least 24 hours in these conditions.

11\. Handed the box containing the cell sample and spare growth medium to
Sajad Razavi Bazaz at 12:20 pm. Box also included some samples from Chris:

  * Alginic acid powder, 8 g
  * Sodium alginate, 8 g
  * Calcium chloride, 20 mM solution
