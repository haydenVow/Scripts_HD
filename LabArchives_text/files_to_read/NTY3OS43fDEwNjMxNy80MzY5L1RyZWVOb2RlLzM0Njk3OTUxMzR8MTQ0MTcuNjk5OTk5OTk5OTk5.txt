Prepare materials for thaw and seed:

1\. Aliquotted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then
placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath for a minimum of 20 minutes
prior to use:

  *  Growth media (for seeding):   90 mL 
  * Time that aliquot was placed in the water bath to warm before use:   13:40

  




## Thaw and seed vial:

3\. Collected the cryovial from Liquid Nitrogen storage & place in foam
floater in water bath for 5 min  14:28 - 14:32  

Location where cryovial was collected from:

Vial details:  3   x  F_DOLLY12  cryovials at   1M  cells each for a total of
3M cells

Tower/Bucket # 2

Box/Cane # 2

`4. Ethanol sprayed & transferred the vial(s) to the BSC.`

`5.  Added  µL of Growth Media (to generate a total volume of 1mL in the
cryovial) to the cryovial, resuspended the cell suspension gently to reduce
osmotic shock. `

`6. Collected the entire 1mL of cell suspension & transfer into the pre-warmed
tube of Growth Media. `

`7. Using a 10mL serological pipette, resuspended & distributed the cells
evenly in the  90 mL of pre-warmed Growth Media (prepared in Step 2). `

`8. Transfered  30 mL to each   T175  flask.  
`

`9. Transfered flask/plate(s) to incubate at: 15:00, incubator 52

Making labels

Note - You will need to increase the passage number by one. (i.e. if your
thawed vial ID has a passage number of 3, when you make a culture ID for you
vessel you will need change the passage number to 4 on Airtable.)
