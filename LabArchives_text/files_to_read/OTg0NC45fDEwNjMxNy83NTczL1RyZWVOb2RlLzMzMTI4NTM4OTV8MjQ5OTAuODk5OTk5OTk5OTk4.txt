PCR amplification using BENTOLAB

  1. Cell pellets were removed from the -20 freezer in the library lab. 
  2. 25uL of QuickMix DNA extraction reagent was added to each of the tubes
  3. Tubes were breifly spun down in the microfuge to ensure all cells were captured in the quick extract reagent.
  4. Solutions were mixed using a pipette and then transferred to PCR tubes.
  5. Tubes were put though a thermocycling program for DNA extraction on the BentoLab and were then left at room temperature while preparing PCR reactions.  
65 degrees C for 6 minutes followed by 98 degrees for 120 seconds.

  6. Made up a master mix for x reactions for primer sets above (# of reactions +1).  Below are intended volumes for 1x 25uL reaction.

  * Added 3μl DNA extract to each PCR reaction tube for rounds 6 and 7. only 1uL of DNA extract was added to round 8 PCR tubes since the DNA concentration was visibly viscous. Reaction volumes were then made up to 30uL using MilliQ.

  1. Took samples to the PCR machine and set the settings to (melting temp for primers used was 61 degress C).  

  2. To visualize PCR products, made up a 1 % agarose gel in 0.5X TBE buffer (1 tablet + 50mL of 0.5X TBE).  Once completely dissolved, add GelGreen at a volume of 1 μl per 10 mL of agarose.
    1. The following tutorial was followed for setting up the gel electrophoresis station on the BentoLab https://bento.bio/protocol/biotechnology-101/introduction-to-gel-electrophoresis/
  3. Ran the PCR products on the gel using 2uL of loading dye mixed with 5uL of PCR product. Loading order listed below.




## Observations:

The DNA extractions for round 8 were visibly viscous (PABPC1 + CDKN1A, R8
control). Therefore only 1uL will be used for DNA extraction.  
(10uM primer solutions were made fresh for all reactions except PABPC1
reaction tubes, there were already 10uM solutions made for these primers.
