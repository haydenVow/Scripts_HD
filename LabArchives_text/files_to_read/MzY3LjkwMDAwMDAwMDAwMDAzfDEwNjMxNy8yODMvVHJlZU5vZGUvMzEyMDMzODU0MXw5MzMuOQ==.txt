### Process:

1\. Took image of vessel with microscope on phase setting.

2\. Gelatin coated    2      x    4CF      vessel and spare    8     x
T175      with sterile filtered 0.1% gelatin solution and then incubated all
coated flasks at 37˚C.

  1. Time when all vessels(s) placed into the incubator       10:50 am 

3\. Aliquotted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then
placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath for a minimum of 20 minutes
prior to use:

  1. TrypLE:     100    mL in     120 mL    tubes
  2.  dPBS (At 37 degrees for washing):     100    mL in     120 mL    tubes
  3.  dPBS (at RT neutralising):     100    mL in     120 mL    tubes
  4. Growth media (for pellet resuspension):     13   mL in    15 ml     tubes
  5. Growth media (for seeding):     600 mL x 2    mL in     500 mL    tubes

Time that all aliquots were placed in the water bath the warm before use
12:00 pm

Note: if aliquots were placed in water bath at different time, record the time
stamp for each individual solution.




4\. Removed vessel(s) from the incubator     14:15   a/pm

5\. Washed the vessel(s) with dPBS (warmed).

6\. Added     10    mL tryple to each vessel/well and incubated at 37˚C.

  1. Start/Finish for TrypLE was     14:26 - 14:36  pm 

7\. Neutralised with     10     dPBS and combined cell suspension into a    4
x 50 mL   tube.

8\. Centrifuged at 650 x g for 5 min.

  1. Start/Finish time for centrifugation was     14:51 - 14:56 pm 




9\. Aspirated the supernatant(s).

10\. Resuspended pellet(s) in      13    mL      growth    media     :   a/pm

11\. Aliquoted      20 uL    of resuspended cells into a microcentrifuge tube
for cell count. (Re-suspended in 40 uL trypan blue

12\. Performed a cell count using the haemocytometer and recorded the cell
count data in the Google Doc spreadsheet called 'Cell Count Spreadsheet' (see
link below):

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1DPzKubYxfHmWogVPihC-
SSIBtIylyrBQE5kRX5Z8NtI/edit#gid=0

  1.  Total cell number was:     17,082,000      
  2. Volume of cell suspension required for subculture was:       6.088 mL      

  3. Cell density per vessel:     4M     




13\. Transferred       6.088 mL     of cell suspension to the pre-warmed
1200    mL Growth media:  

14\. Transferred cell suspension into the pre-gelatin coated       4cf
vessel.

15\. Left at RT in the BSC for 30 min to allow cells to settle      16:43 -
16:03 pm

16\. Transferred vessel(s) to incubate at:

  * [x]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells) thermo incubator
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (avian cells)




Remaining 9082000 of cells in cell suspension was seeded onto gelatex
scaffolds (n=1 zein, n=1 gelatin) and a previously prepared autoclaved and
freeze-dried agarose sample at 3M per scaffold.

2\. Prepare 25 mL growth media in a 50 mL tube and place in waterbath   16:48
- 17:02 pm

1\. Centrifuged cell suspension at 650 x g for 5 min.

  1. Start/Finish time for centrifugation was     16:50 - 16:55 pm

2\. Aspirate supernatant and resuspend in 180 uL of growth media  

3\. Dispirbute 60 uL of cell suspension onto each scaffold.

4\. Allow cells to adhere for 30 minutes    17:16 - 16:46 pm

5\. Transfer 8mL of pre-warmed growth media into each well.

6\. Place plate into the incubator (thermo)
