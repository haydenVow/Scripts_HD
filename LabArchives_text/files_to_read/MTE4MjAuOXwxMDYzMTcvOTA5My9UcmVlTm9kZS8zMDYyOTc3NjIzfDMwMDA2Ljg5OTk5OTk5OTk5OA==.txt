Process:

Aliquoted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then
placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath > 30 minutes prior to use

  1. Observed cultures under the microscope and recorded confluence in the table above. 
  2. Imaged cultures on 10x magnification (captured in Mia)
  3. TrypLE:   100   mL 
  4. dPBS (for washing & neutralising)   200 mL
  5. Growth media (for pellet resuspension and seeding):   600 
  6. Washed the flask(s) with dPBS.
  7. Added    100mL tryple to each vessel/well and incubated at 37˚C for     
  8. Neutralised with   100mL  dPBS (warmed) and combined cell suspension into   50mL  tubes.
  9. Centrifuged at 650 x g for 5 min.
  10. Aspirated+ discarded supernatant
  11. Combined and resuspended pellet(s) in     40  mL media.  
Performed a cell count using the hemocytometer and recorded the cell count
data in widget or the Google Doc spreadsheet called 'Cell Count Spreadsheet'
(see link below):

  12. Total cell number was:  
 46,080,000

  13. Approximately 19M cells (16mL cell suspension) were seeded into 1x 4CF in 600mL of pre-warmed growth media. Transferred flask to incubate at 37ºC, 5% CO2, library lab incubator #77

  14. The remaining cells were banked. Centrifuged remaining cells at 650g for 5 min.

  15. Removed supernatant and resuspended cells in 13.5mL of cryostor

  16. Aliquoted cells in crysotor into 13x vials, with 1mL per vial (2M cells/vial)

  17. Re-seeded cells as per table above.
