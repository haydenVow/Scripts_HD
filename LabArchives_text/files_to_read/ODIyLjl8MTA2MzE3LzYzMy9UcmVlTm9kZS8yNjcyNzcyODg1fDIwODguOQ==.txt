RELATED TO MILESTONE:  NA-- focused on optimization of current production
methods

AIM/PURPOSE: To test whether mixing E6 ingredients in a concentrated solution
(500x concentration), then freezing them, and then using them to make E6 media
will impact differentiation compared to using E6 media made fresh.

HYPOTHESIS: Using a E6 bullet as described above will not impact
differentiation.

RESULTS SUMMARY:  

CONCLUSIONS: %MyoG was significantly lower when cells were treated with the
frozen E6 bullet compared to fresh E6 media.  These results mean we cannot use
frozen E6 bullets to formulate our differentiation media if we wish to achieve
performance seen when using fresh E6 media.

NEXT STEPS: This should be a dot point list of any immediate outcomes, changes
to SOPs, as well as providing a direct link to any new experiments arising
from these findings. Importantly, this section should also include any
potential DEPLOYMENTS to the production team
