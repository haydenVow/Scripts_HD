##  




Process:

  1. Warm up pre-aliquotted  E6 Media  in 24w plate ( 1.5 mL per well approx) 11:15 am
    1. if media is provided in tube, plate out 1.5 mL per well into a new 24wp a per platemap
    2. Removed sample plates from the incubator and place in BSC (lights off)
  2. transferred sample plate (tray with cups) and feed plate into BSC.
  3. Remove parafilm from feed and sample plate. 
  4. Transferred all samples to fresh media plate by lifting tray over to new plate
  5. Parafilmed sample plates and returned vessel to incubate at:    11:42    

  * [X]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (avian cells)

  

  * Incubator ( XXX ), Lab [Main/Library/Production]




## Sample Selection

  1. Using sterile tweezers, select 1 "meatball" from each cup in row 2
    1. row 3 is cell-free and does not need to be treated
  2. transfer into a new well on a 24w plate prefilled with warm 750 uL MTT solution, see below
  3. Proceed with MTT protocol as below




## Staining with MTT:

  1. Aliquot 5 ml of DMEM media and place in water bath   11:15    

  2. Weigh out 25 mg of MTT (Stock #884) into a falcon tube then add 3.5ml of the pre-warmed DMEM. Pipette up and down until re-suspended. Yellow colour should form. Cover tube with foil.   11:30    

  3. Removed the sample of interest from the plate into wells prefilled with MTT solution, using sterile tweezers.
  4. Protected the sample from light using foil and placed in the incubator (37ºC, 5% CO2).    11:45    

  5. Left sample to stain for 1hr. Start 11:45 am
  6. Pictures of the samples in the MTT plate were taken using a phone/camera. 
  7. Wash 2x with 1 mL warm PBS (can be non-sterile) 
  8. Then samples were imaged down the microscope (phase), 3 images per sample at appropriate magnification

See images below.
