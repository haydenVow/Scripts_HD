Process:

Collected 50 mL shake tubes from shaker

  1. Centrifuged 4 x 50 mL tubes at 300 x g for 5 min.  10:58 - 11:03
  2. Aspirated   100% (5 mL) of supernatant, taking extra care to not disrupt or aspirate pellet 
  3. Re-suspended pellets in  100 uL dPBS. Gently pipette-mixed culture to break up pellet and generate an even cell suspension. 
  4. Took 10 uL samples from each culture for cell count/visualisation under haemocytometer
  5. After cell count, determined whether to re-suspend in growth media or discard cultures
    * Culture 7415 was the only culture which appeared to have any remaining live cells. A cell count estimated that there are 5200 cells in culture. See haemocytometer images posted below.
  6. Aliquoted growth media as follows:
    * 5 mL D/F+10%FBS+1xP/S
      * Placed in water bath  11:36 
  7. Returned culture 7415 to incubator and discarded cultures 7342, 7466 & 7465   11:41

  1. 7415

Cultures 7342, 7465 & 7466 were discarded due to a total absence of live cells
