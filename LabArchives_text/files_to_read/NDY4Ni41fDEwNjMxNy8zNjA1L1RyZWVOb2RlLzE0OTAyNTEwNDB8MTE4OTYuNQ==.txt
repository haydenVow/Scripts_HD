Observations/Summary:

Plates were imaged on DAPI (center of each well) on 5x. These images were
processed through MIA to obtain cell counts. Wells with counts >10 000 cells
were excluded (these mainly occurred when there weren't any cells in the well
so the macro did not perform well). From the remaining wells, the top 24
clones were chosen for a passage.

I only realised after the passage that most cells in 96 well plates were round
and dead. This was probably due to the Hoechst stain the day before.

Most wells that were passaged didn't have many cells leftover after
transferring the cell suspension.  However, there were a couple of wells where
this wasn't the case (see images).
