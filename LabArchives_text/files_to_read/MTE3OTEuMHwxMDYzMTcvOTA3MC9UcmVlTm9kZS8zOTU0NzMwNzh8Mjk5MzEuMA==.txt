Process
  
  
  1. Took 1 x 510 uL sample from each flask in continuous culture (EPIC31425).
  2. Performed counts using Vicell and recorded the counts on Team media spreadsheet.
  3. Added 29 mL of 50/50 RPMI/CHO Nuvonis suspension media + GFs (with added glucose, L-glutamine, ala-gln, and HT) to 9 x E125s
  4. Added 29 mL of 50/50 RPMI/CHO Nuvonis suspension media + GFs (with added glucose, L-glutamine, ala-gln, and without HT) to 3 x E125s
  5. Added 29 mL of 50/50 RPMI/CHO Nuvonis suspension media + GFs (with added glucose, ala-gln, HT and pyruvate) to 3 x E125s
  6. Placed all E125s in shaking incubator to warm and equilibrate media 
  7. While media was warming, printed labels for flasks
  8. Received 87.193mL of cell suspension from EPIC31425 containing 96M cells, leaving behind  312.807mL containing 344,400,000 cells in continuous culture
  9. Centrifuged at 300 xg for 10 min 
  10. Aspirated 100% of supernatant and re-suspended in 16 mL of 50/50 RPMI/CHO Nuvonis suspension media + GFs (no additives)
  11. Retrieved flasks from incubator and brought into BSC 10 at a time
  12. Added 1mL of cell suspension to each flask (6M cells per flask, 200K cells/mL)
  13. Added labels to each flask
  14. Replaced flasks in incubator (37'C, 5% CO2, 120 RPM)   
  
  

  15. After 'Media op weekly sync' meeting, we decided to add Control 4, FS3 and FS4 to this experiment.
  16. Made up 300 mL of 50/50 RPMI/CHO Nuvonis suspension media + GFs (with added glucose to 7.4 g/L and L-glutamine to 4mM).
  17. Added 29 mL of RPMI/CHO Nuvonis suspension media + GFs (with added glucose to 7.4 g/L and L-glutamine to 4mM) to 9 x E125s.
  18. Placed all E125s in shaking incubator to warm and equilibrate media 
  19. While media was warming, printed labels for flasks.
  20. Received 348mL of cell suspension from EPIC31425 containing 60M cells, leaving behind ~50mL containing 9M cells in continuous culture that were seeded at 180K cells/mL in an E250 (kept for continuous culture).
  21. Aspirated 100% of supernatant and re-suspended in 10 mL of 50/50 RPMI/CHO Nuvonis suspension media + GFs with added glucose to 7.4 g/L and L-glutamine to 4mM).
  22. Retrieved flasks from incubator and brought into BSC 10 at a time
  23. Added 1mL of cell suspension to each flask (6M cells per flask, 200K cells/mL)
  24. Added labels to each flask
  25. Replaced flasks in incubator (37'C, 5% CO2, 120 RPM) 


Notes


Performed a cell count on the extra mL of cell suspension used to seed flasks
1-15 and cell density was pretty low, 3.63M cells/mL instead of 6M cells/mL.
Also, performed a cell count on the extra mL of cell suspension used to seed
flasks 16-24 and cell density was 4.705M cells/mL instead of 6M cells/mL. Very
clumpy looking cells.
