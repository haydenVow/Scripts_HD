BUFFY HARVEST

  

  1. Removed vessel(s) from the incubator    10 :20  pm 

  2. Removed media after imaging

  3. Washed the vessel(s) with dPBS (warmed).

  4. Added     300    mL tryple to each vessel/well and incubated at 37ËšC.

    1. Start/Finish for TrypLE was    10:25  \- 10:45  pm 

  5. Neutralised with     200 mL     dPBS and combined cell suspension into a    4 x 250 mL     tube.

  6. Centrifuged at 650 x g for 5 min.

    1. Start/Finish time for centrifugation was     11:25 - 11:30   pm
