Live staining with CMFDA: SEE GUIDE ON CMFDA STAINING HERE  

Preparation of stock and and working solutions for CMFDA Cell Tracker

1\. Remove the CMFDA powder from the freezer (main lab) and allow it to warm
to room temperature. Each aliquot is 50 ug.

  1.  Briefly centrifuge the tube to pellet the CMFDA powder

2\. Add 50 uL high-quality, anhydrous DMSO to the powder and pipette up and
down until well suspended. This will yield a 1 mM CFDA stock solution.

  1. NOTE - Once prepared, the DMSO stock solution should be stored at -20'C in a 70 mL pot submerged in silica-gel desiccant beads for a short period for one series of experiments. If a large amount of stock solution is left, then any remaining solution should be aliquoted and frozen at < \- 20Â°C. Avoid repeated freeze-thaw cycles, and protect from light. 




3\. Aliquot     6    mL PBS or DMEM/F12 for washing the samples and place in
waterbath    12:29   . (This is only necessary for samples containing serum as
serum interferes with the CMFDA stain)

5\. Transfer     6    uL of the 1mM CMFDA stock solution to     3    mL of
prepared DMEM/F12 PRF growth media (m6460) in a light safe falcon tube to
protect it from light. Vortex to ensure thorough mixing with the resulting
solution being approximately 2 uM CMFDA working solution. (2uL of 1mM CMFDA
stock solution: 1mL of D/F media.)

  1.  Place in the water bath to be pre-warmed    12:29    

 5\. Aspirate the media from all the wells both cell seeded and cell free
scaffolds

6\. Add     1    mL of pre-warmed DMEM/F12 PRF growth media to the wells from
each plate as a rinse step to remove any residual serum.

7\. Aspirate the rinsing media

8\. Add    1     mL of pre-warmed CMFDA working solution to the samples and
incubate for 30 minutes at 37'C covered in foil to protect samples from light.

  1. Start/Finish time was:  14:33 - 15:03   

  2.  If the CMFDA working solution is no longer required dispose of solution as aqueous waste as aqueous solutions of CMFDA are susceptible to hydrolysis and should be used within one day.

9\. Remove    1000     uL of staining solution from each well

10\. Image all wells from plates on the Zaber fluorescence microscope or AXIO
(channel AF488 for CMFDA [Live cells]). Remember to image both sides.

11\. Transfer all the scaffolds into a new plate.

12\. Replace all wells with fresh pre warmed  E6 growth media

13\. Return plates to the incubator.




Observations/Summary:

Did not see any live cells on the cell containing no insert sample. - however
only cut a very small portion of the sample that was on the tail end. Also
left the sample without media for an hour. It is likely that this caused the
cells to die. ):

For the conical insert, saw live cells. Noticed that the cells seemed to be
more on the outside than the inside of the gel in the thicker regions. Saw
some stretched looking cells.
