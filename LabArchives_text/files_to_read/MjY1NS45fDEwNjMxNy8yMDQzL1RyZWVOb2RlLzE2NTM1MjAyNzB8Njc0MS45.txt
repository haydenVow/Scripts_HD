Process:

1\. Aliquotted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then
placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath for a minimum of 20 minutes
prior to use:

  1. TrypLE:    20 mL   mL in   1x 50 mL    tube
  2. dPBS (for washing)   20 mL   mL in   1x 50 mL   tube
  3. Times that all aliquots were placed in the water bath to warm before use 14:07

Note: if aliquots were placed in water bath at different times, record the
time stamp for each individual solution.




1.5 Weigh empty 100mm plate. Weight =20.088g

2\. Weigh empty tubes

  1. Tube 1 (Vit C + TGF) = 12.524
  2. Tube 2 (Vit C only) = 12.534
  3. Tube 3 (negative control #1) = 12.499
  4. Tube 4 (negative control #2) = 12.483

3\. Aspirated spent media and retained in pre-weighed 50mL tubes (in case
cells are floating in media)

4\. Washed the flask(s) with dPBS.

5\. Weigh the empty flasks with cells.

  1. Plate 1 (Vit C + TGF) = 20.4669
  2. Plate 2 (Vit C only) = 20.8197
  3. Plate 3 (negative control #1) = 20.6986
  4. Plate 4 (negative control #2) = 20.7528

 Added    5   mL tryple to each vessel/well and incubated at 37ËšC for   15
min  

Note: Fibroblasts typically require 15-18 minutes of incubation with tryple,
slightly longer than MuSCs.

  1. Start/Finish time for tryple was    14:35      \-  14:50     




5\. Aspirate cell suspension from all plates and transfer into sterile pre-
weighed 50 mL tubes (with spent media already added)

6\. Wash flask with 5 mL room temperature dPBS

7\. Centrifuge tubes at 650 x g for 5 minutes

  1. Start/Finish centrifuge time was 15:00-15:05

8\. Aspirate supernatant + blotted upturned ethanol sprayed Rediwipe to remove
residual liquid.

9\. Weight tubes containing cell pellet

  1. Tube 1 (6836 Vit C + TGF) =  12.6178
  2. Tube 2 (6837 Vit C only) =  12.7184
  3. Tube 3 (Negative control #1) = 12.6101
  4. Tube 4 (Negative control #2) = 12.5896

Weight of pellet:

  1. Tube 1 (6836 Vit C + TGF) =  0.0938g
  2. Tube 2 (6837 Vit C only) = 0.1844g 
  3. Tube 3 (negative control #1) = 0.111g
  4. Tube 4 (negative control #2) = 0.1066g

Observations/Summary:  

In the VitC (LAAP2) dish, the cells had detached from the plate as a single
sheet which floated in the tryple. The sheet could be lifted with tweezers
without breaking however when lifted from the liquid, it folded in on itself,
forming a snotty blob.

In the VitC (LAAP2) +TGF dish, cells had form a single clump of cells, even
before tryple was applied. They had the appearance of a little white maggot.

There was nothing notable about the untreaded dishes.
