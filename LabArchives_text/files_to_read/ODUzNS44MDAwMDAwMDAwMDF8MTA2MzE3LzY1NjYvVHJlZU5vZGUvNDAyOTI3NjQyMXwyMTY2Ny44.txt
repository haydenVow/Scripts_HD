### Process:

1\. Took image of vessel with microscope on phase setting.

2\. Collect a pre-Gelatin coated     4     x    T175      flask that was
stored in the fridge, parafilmed.

  1. Time when flask was placed into the incubator     16:25 -     

3\. Aliquotted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then
placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath for a minimum of 20 minutes
prior to use:

  1. TrypLE:    40   mL in    1x 50mL   tubes
  2.  dPBS (for neutralising):    40  mL
  3.  dPBS (for washing):     40    mL
  4. Growth media (for seeding):    240  mL 

Time that all aliquots were placed in the water bath the warm before use
16:28  

Note: if aliquots were placed in water bath at different time, record the time
stamp for each individual solution.




4\. Removed vessel(s) from the incubator  16:40

5\. Washed the vessel(s) with dPBS (warmed).

6\. Added   10 mL tryple to each vessel/well and incubated at 37˚C.

  1. Start/Finish for TrypLE was   16:49 - 17:05   

7\. Neutralised with   10  dPBS and combined cell suspension into a    1 X
50mL   tube.

8\. Centrifuged at 650 x g for 5 min.

  1. Start/Finish time for centrifugation was   16:40 - 16:45    




9\. Aspirated the supernatant(s).

10\. Resuspended pellet(s) in  120 mL   Growth (incl 10uM p38i)   media  17:10  

11\. Transferred cell suspension into 2 x un-coated T75 flask. Leave at 37C in
incubator for 45 mins  17:19 \- 18:04  

12\. After 45 minutes, transfer supernatant into 4 x gelatin-coated T75 flask.
Allow to sit at RT for 30 mins to allow cells to settle   18:08 - 18:38  




13\. Transferred vessel(s) to incubate at:

  * [ X ]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (avian cells)




Observations/Summary:

KUZCO20 MuSCs successfully pre-plated in 2 x non-coated T175 flask and then
transferred into 4 x gelatin-coated T175 flask.
