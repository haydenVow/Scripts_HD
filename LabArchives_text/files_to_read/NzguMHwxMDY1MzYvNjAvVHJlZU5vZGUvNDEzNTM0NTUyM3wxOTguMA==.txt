Achievements

  * Banked 97 vials of DAISY4_WCB_1 @ 100 million cells per vial
  * 

Deviations

  * As there were quite a few dead cells in the original vial cell count, only 3xT175 flasks were seeded
  * Due to faster growth than originally expected, P2 was pushed a day earlier than anticipated and seeded at a lower density 
  * P2 showed some changed cell morphology with 'cell splattering'.
  * P3 yielded more cells than anticipated so was seeded at a higher density in fewer flasks, and therefore harvested a day earlier too. 

Original Plan:  
Day 1: Thaw 2x vials into 4x T175  
Day 2: 50% feed  
Day 4: Passage 4xT175 into 1x4CF  
Day 6: 50% feed  
Day 7: Passage 1x4CF into 4x4CF  
Day 9: 50% Feed  
Day 10: Harvest and freeze  
Day 11: Transfer to LN  
  
Actual Plan:  
Day 1: Thaw 2x vials into 3x T175  
Day 2: 50% feed  
Day 3: Passage 3xT175 into 1x5CS + 1x2CF  
Day 5: 50% feed  
Day 6: Passage 1x5CS + 1x 2CF into 4x5CS+1x2CF  
Day 8: Harvest and freeze  
Day 9: Transfer to LN
