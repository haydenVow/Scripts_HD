1\. Prepared  2.5 mL PBST (0.2% Triton-X)

2\. Prepared  2.5  mL blocking buffer: PBST (0.1% Triton-X + PBS) + 3% bovine
serum albumin (BSA). (Kept in the fridge until needed in blocking step)

3\. Prepared Primary Antibody Mix:  12.5 µL  Primary #1 MyoG (Santa Cruz)
(1:200) +  2487.5  µL Blocking Buffer

Vortexed antibody mix for 5 seconds and stored refrigerated away from light
until needed.

# Procedure

  1. Original Plate (Plate ID: ) was removed from the incubator 12:58
  2. 4 x D1 samples were moved into a 96WP to check is the Hoechst was still fluorescing.
    * A few bright spots were observed, but it is unclear if the Hoechst is mostly not fluorescing anymore or if there are simply no cells left adhered on the sample.
  3. `24` wells on 2 x 24-well plate (Wash Plate 1 & 2) were pre-filled with 2 ml of PBS per well (1 well for each sample to be fixed and stained)
  4. WASH 1: The tray containing all inserts was lifted out of the original plate and placed into the fresh pre-filled PBS plate (Wash Plate 1). The samples were incubated in PBS at room temp, 5 min 12:59 - 13:04
    1. All remaining media in the original plate was aspirated to waste and the plate was disposed of. The lid was used to cover and label the fixed samples.
  5. WASH 2: A second PBS wash was performed by removing the tray from the plate and placing it into the second wash plate (Wash Plate 2) prefilled with 2 mL PBS, incubated for 5 min 13:04 - 13:09
    1. The first PBS wash was aspirated from Wash Plate 1 and replaced with 2 mL of 4% PFA
  6. PFA FIXING: The tray containing all inserts was lifted out of Wash Plate 2 and placed back into Wash Plate 1 (now containing PFA), incubated for 15 min  13:10 - 13:15  

    1. All remaining media in Wash Plate 2 was aspirated to waste




Process:

Permeabilise

1\. Using tweezers, moved scaffold pieces into 1 x 96WP

2\. Added  100 µL PBST (0.2% Triton-X) to each well for 15 min:  13:30 - 13:45  

3\. Aspirated PBST for each well.




Blocking

1\. Added  100 µL of blocking buffer (3% BSA in PBST [0.1% Triton-X]) and
incubate for 45 minutes - 1hr at RT. (no more than 1 hour):   13:45 - 14:39  




Single/Simultaneous Primary Antibody staining

1\. Removed blocking buffer from each well.

2\. Incubated cells with primary antibody ~~for 90min - 2hrs at RT, or~~ at
4ºC overnight:   14:41

3\. Parafilmed plates and stored at 4ºC in tissue culture lab Fridge.

After this step, all further task should be performed in a dark room. The
vessel should also be wrapped foil when not used.
