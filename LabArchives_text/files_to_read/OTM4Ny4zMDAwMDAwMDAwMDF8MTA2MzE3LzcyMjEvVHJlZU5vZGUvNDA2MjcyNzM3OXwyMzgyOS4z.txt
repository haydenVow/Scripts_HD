Prepare Cells for nucleofection

Cells used for this experiment were taken from the following epic (EPIC30430)

  1. Aliquoted out 2x30mL of dPBS, 30mL of Tryple and 10mL of DMEM/F12 + 20% FBS (NO P/S) and placed all aliquots in the waterbath ready for passage.
  2. Media was removed from cells, flasks were PBS washed with 10 mL per flask and triplised with 10 mL tryple per flask. 
  3. Tryple was incubated for 8 minutes at 30 degrees, 5% CO2. 
  4. Tryple was neutralised with 10 mL PBS per flask
  5. Cells were placed in a falcon tube 
  6. cells were centrifuged for 5 minutes at 400g.
  7. supernatant was removed and cells were resuspended in 10mL of dPBS
  8. cell count was performed under a hemocytometer after a 10uL aliquot was taken and diluted using trypan blue (ratio: )
  9. The number of cells required for the experiment was determined. 0.4 x 10^5 cells required per well.
    1. Cells for Condition 1 (ZIC1) transfection = 0.4*10^6 x 15 = 6 x0^6
    2. Cells for Condition 2 (ZIC1 + CDKN1A) transfection = 0.4*10^6 x 15 = 6 x0^6
    3. Cells for Condition 3 (ZIC1 + DHSR3) transfection= 0.4*10^6 x 15 = 6 x10^6
    4. Cells for Condition 4 (CDKN1A + CDKN1B) transfection = 0.4*10^6 x 15 = 6 x10^6
    5. Cells for Control (Cas9, no guide) = 0.4*10^6 x 12 = 4.8x10^6  
We therefore need 28.8 x 10^6 cells  

Total cell number harvested = 37,000,000

  * 6 well plates were prepared to receive nucleofected cells based on total cell number counted (400,000 cells/well, ideally 8 plates total). Wells required were filled with 3 mL of DMEM/F12 + 20% FBS WITHOUT ANTIBIOTICS! 
  * 6 well plates were placed in the incubator (30 degrees, 5% CO2) to warm plates with media []. 
  * 12 Plates total. 




## *Ensure cell count is performed before determining how much of the
following reagents to make

Plan: 7 well plate nucleofections. 15 wells per guide and 12 wells for
controls

Prepare guides/cas9/Cas9 electroporation enhancer

  1. Guides in TE buffer (44 uM) (stored at -20) were retrieved from the freezer, (reconstitute new guides in 45.45uL of TE buffer if required). 
  2. Made up Cas9 mix. *Below is a 1 x mix for 1 well, multiply by number of wells you intend to make x 1.2 to get total volume required for experiment.

3\. Make up the Cas9 + guide mix. Below is a 1 x mix for 1 well, multiply by
number of wells you intend to make x 1.20 to get total volume required for
experiment.

4\. Incubated mix for 10-20 min, (tubes were left in the bench hood for 10
minutes to incubate from [TIMESTAMP]

5\. while incubating, the electroporation enhancer was prepared.

  1. Buffer was removed from -20 freezer and thawed using body temperature. 
  2. Mxes for each guide were made up to 10.8 uM solutions using 1 x TE buffer. *Below is a 1 x mix for 1 well, multiply by number of wells you intend to make x 1.2 to get total volume required for experiment.

Nucleofection

  1. The required cell number ( all cells harvested) was pipetted into a 15mL sterile falcon tube
  2. Cells were centrifuged for 5 mins at 300g at room temp [ ]
  3. Supernatant was removed
  4. The pellet was resuspended in        mL 1x PBS 
  5. Four 1.5mL sterile eppendorf tubes were set up inside the BSC and labelled 1-4. volumes of cell suspension in dPBS were transferred to each tube as per the guide below. 
    1. Tube 1 - ZIC1
    2. Tube 2 - ZIC1 + CDKN1A
    3. Tube 3 - ZIC1 + DHRS3
    4. Tube 4 - CDKN1A + CDKN1B 
  6. The cells were centrifuged at 400g for 5 mins at room temp (HINGE OUT IN CENTRIFUGE)
  7. The supernatant was removed from each tube. It is important to remove as much as possible. Use a 1 mL tip to remove most of the supernatant and then switch to a 200 uL pipette to remove a little more if necessary. Do not disturb the pellet.
  8. To each Eppendorf tube the following mix was prepared, R buffer added first, then enhancer, then RNP.
