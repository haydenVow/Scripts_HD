Experimental Plan

  

[Day 1] - Thaw 1 x vial of DOLLY12 fibroblast WCB into 1 x T175 using DMEM/F12
+ 20% FBS + 1x PS.

[Day 2] \- 50% feed of revived cells with DMEM/F12+20%FBS+1xPS

[Day 4] \- Passage DOLLY12 fibroblasts to at least 4 x T75s. Perform a cell
count and subculture at 7k cells per cm2.

[Day 5] \- 100% feed all flasks with the following conditions: DMEM/F12+10%FBS
(control), E89C media, E8+150mg/mL albumin, E8 + fibroblast goodies.

Fibroblast goodies = 15ng/mL PDGF + 7nM IGF1 + protease inhibitors + 1:100
dilution of concentrated lipids.

  

Keep cells in culture until 10 doublings are reached.

  1. Every ~3 days, perform a 50% feed.
  2. Passage when the cells get close to 100% confluent.
  3. Perform a cell count each time and track the number of doublings. 
  4. Monitor cell morphology and the speed of doublings over time.
  5. When 10 doublings is achieved or when the cells stop dividing, the experiment can be concluded.
  6. It is only critical to keep 1 flask of cells in each media condition; the other cells can be discarded or used for other experiments.
