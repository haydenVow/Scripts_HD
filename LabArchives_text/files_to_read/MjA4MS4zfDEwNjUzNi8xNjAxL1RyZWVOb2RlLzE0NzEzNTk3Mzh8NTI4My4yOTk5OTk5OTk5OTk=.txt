Procedure




Note:  
  
Cells were very clumpy and the count had not changed since Tuesday (2 days
ago). I [CB] consulted with Lily and she said this was not uncommon for the
75:25 RPMI:CHOin1 media and the cells had likely reached their peak density.

It was decided to passage them into 2xE2000 (500mL each)




Vi-Cell Count 1: 433,000 vc/mL 96.3% viability  
Vi-Cell Count 2: 349,000 vc/mL 97.9% viability  
  
Observation: cells were very clumpy
