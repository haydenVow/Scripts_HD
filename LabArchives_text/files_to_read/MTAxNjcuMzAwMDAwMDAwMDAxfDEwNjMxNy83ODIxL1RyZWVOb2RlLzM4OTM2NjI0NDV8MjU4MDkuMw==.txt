### Process:

1\. Took image of vessel with microscope on phase setting.

3\. Aliquotted the required volume of each reagent at room temp  

  1. TrypLE:     80    mL 
  2.  dPBS (for neutralising):     80    mL
  3.  dPBS (for washing):     80   mL  

  




4\. Removed vessel(s) from the incubator

5\. Washed the vessel(s) with dPBS (warmed).

6\. Added     10mL   tryple to each vessel/well and incubated at 30ËšC.

7\. Neutralised with     equal volume    dPBS  and combined cell suspension
into   7 x 50mL     tubes.

8\. Centrifuged at 500 x g for 5 min.




9\. Aspirated the supernatant(s).

10\. Resuspended pellets in    2  mL of cryostar CS10, cells were then
transferred to 2 cryotubes (1ml/cryotube) and placed in a Mr Frosty and moved
to the -80 freezer in library lab.  
  




Observations/Summary:

Re. cultures prior to harvest (see images on mia capture for reference):

\- Culture ID 11790 (P+P 2E) had a lot of debris.

\- Culture ID 11788 (ZIC1 3A) showed beautiful alignment and was evenly
confluent.

\- Culture ID 11792 (Igfbp4 4B) showed uneven seeding thus, confluence.

\- Culture IDs 11835 and 11836 (ZIC1 1E) did not show 100% confluence however,
given there were 2 x T175 seeded with this ZIC1 clone and I wanted to bank all
T175 at the same time thus, I proceeded to do so.

I was meant to bank 4 x cryovials of clone ZIC1 1E however, after having a
look at the pellet size and observing it was comparable to the pellet size of
the rest of the clones, I decided to only bank 2. I spilt one of them inside
the BSC so I ended up only banking one cryovial for this clone.
