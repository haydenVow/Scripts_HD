Lot IH-009


conductivity meter calibrated with calibration solution (update this on
widget)  
  
Gibco pH: 7.5 (old bottle opened 20/10/21) added this to widget also

IH009 also came out as 7.5 so the pH meter was recalibrated and media tested
again, this time it came up as 6.7 for IH009 and 6.9 for gibco
