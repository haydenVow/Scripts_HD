PCR amplification using BENTOLAB

PCR amplification was performed on DNA samples extracted from cell pellets
taken on 25/02/2022. These amplifications were done alongside DNA extractions
in EPIC30283 from Mar-2 till Mar-4. These activities were included in lab book
entries within this EPIC.

## Observations

The Quick extract DNA sample used of CHOMP 07 was quite viscous, as a result
it was difficult to tell if 1uL was pipetted, some volumes of DNA template
added may be between 0.5 and 1uL.
