Overview


Siliconization involves placing a thin layer of dimethyldichlorosilane
(Sigmacote) onto glass surfaces to make them extremely hydrophobic. This helps
to prevent microcarriers and other charged particles from adhering to the
storage container during reconstitution and storage.


Protocol


  1. Rinse a clean bottle 3 times with ultrapure water
  2. Place the rinsed bottle in the fume hood to dry
  3. Once the bottle is dry, place the bottle of Sigmacote in the fume hood, or if a fume hood is not available, then perform in a well ventilated space ideally outside.
  4. Transfer 1 mL of Sigmacote to the bottle
  5. Lie the bottle on its side and roll the bottle so that the Sigmacote coats the interior wall of the entire bottle
  6. If there is not enough Sigmacote to cover the entire interior wall of the bottle, add another 1 mL of Sigmacote then lie the bottle on its side again. There should be an obvious "puddle" a few mm deep, even after rolling the bottle.
  7. Repeat steps 3 - 5 until the "puddle" can be seen
  8. Stand the bottle upright and allow the residue to evaporate overnight
  9. Rinse the dry bottle 3 times with ultrapure water
