Prepare materials for thaw and seed:

1\. Aliquoted:

  * Growth medium (for re-suspending and counting cells):  5 mL 
  * Growth medium (for seeding):   30 mL 
    * Time that aliquots were placed in the water bath (set to 30ºC) to warm before use:  10:57  

  




## Thaw and seed vial

2\. Collected the cryovials from LN2 storage & place in foam floater in water
bath for MAXIMUM 5 min   11:06  

Location where cryovials were collected from:

Vial details:  3 x  F_CHOMP09 cryovials at 2M cells each for a total of 6M
cells

  

Tower/Bucket # 5

Box/Cane # 5

Vial location: A8

Vial ID(s): 3619, 3620, 3621  

3\. Ethanol sprayed & transferred the vial(s) to the BSC.

5\. Added 500 µL of Growth Medium from  (to generate a total volume of 1 mL in
the cryovial) to each cryovial, resuspended the cell suspensions gently to
reduce osmotic shock.

6\. Collected the entire 1 mL of both cell suspensions & transferred into the
pre-warmed tube 5 mL aliquot of Growth Medium

7\. Re-suspended cell suspension with a 5 mL serelogical pipette, then took 1
x 10 uL sample for cell count (note that total volume for cell count will be 6
mL due to 500 uL being added from each thawed vial to the 5 mL growth medium
aliquot)

  * 4,220,000 

8\. Spun cell culture in media for 5 mins at 300g

9\. Removed supernatant

10\. Resuspended in the 2 mL rewarmed media

11\. Transferred 2 mL media and cells into T175 flask along with 28 mL warmed
media

10\. Transfered plates to incubate at:

  * [ ]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (avian cells)
  * [X] 30ºC, 5% CO2 (reptilian cells)

  

Making labels

Note - You will need to increase the passage number by one. (i.e. if your
thawed vial ID has a passage number of 3, when you make a culture ID for you
vessel you will need change the passage number to 4 on Airtable.)
