Preparation of zein

Volumes of zein needed for different plate formats:

6-well plate - 1 scaffold = 1ml

24-well plate - 1 scaffold = 300 ul (pipetted onto 2 ml of water)

96-well plate - 1 scaffold = 50ul

  

  1. Determine the following key volumes and weights to make the desired number of scaffold pieces:
    1. Number of scaffold pieces desired: 6 wells x 3 plates = 18 scaffolds 
    2. Volume of zein solution used per scaffold piece: 1 mL per piece, ~ 6 mL sol'n per 6WP 
    3. Total volume of zein solution (number of scaffold pieces x volume/piece) + loss/error: 5*3 + error = 20 mL total sol'n
    4. Total grams of zein required (total volume of zein solution / 5): 20/5 = 4 g zein powder
    5. Total volume of 80% ethanol to make (total volume of zein solution + loss/error to the filter): 18 + 2 = 20 mL 80% ethanol
  2. Acquire aliquot volumes of the Ultrapure water (sterile filter milliQ water using a 0.2 um filter into a sterile tube in the BSC) and of 100% ethanol.
  3. Weigh out 3.6 g of zein powder into a sterile sample pot and record the actual weight below:
    1. Actual zein weight:  4 g
  4. Transfer the zein powder, 100% ethanol and Ultrapure water into the BSC
  5. Make 20 mL of 80% ethanol in the BSC and filter it using a 0.2 um filter
    1. Volume made: ~ 20 mL
  6. Add 18 mL of 80% ethanol into a sterile sample pot/container and add a sterile magnetic stirrer bar (previously spray with ethanol then autoclave in a autoclave bag) inside the BSC
  7. Commence mixing of the 80% ethanol on the stirrer (sprayed down and brought into the BSC) and slowly add the pre-weighed 3.6055 g zein powder until it is all added
  8. Mix at room temperature until the powder has completely solubilised (20-60 minutes):
    1. Start time: 12:20
    2. Finish time: 13:45
  9. Add 5 mL of 0.2 um filtered ultrapure water to each well of a 6-well plate.
    1. Number of 6-well plates required: 6 plates
    2. Total vol. filtered ultrapure water required = 90 mL + error = 100 mL 
  10. After solubilisation, carefully add 1000 uL of the zein solution to the top surface of the ultrapure water in each well in the 6-well plate (drop by drop) so that a skin forms on the surface of the water.
  11. Allow the zein to form in each plate inside the BSC with the lids completely removed for 60-90 minutes
    1. Start time (last plate): 14:00
    2. Finish time (started removing first pieces): 
  12. Using a sterile spatula and forceps, loosen the edges of each zein piece from the walls of the wells and transfer the zein pieces into a sterile sample pot/container/tissue culture dish with 20 mL of DMEM. Discard any damaged or cracked pieces
    1. Number of pieces discarded due to damage or dropping:  
    2. Number of pieces available for use: 
  13. Seal the container and store the scaffold pieces at 4C overnight or until needed, for a maximum of 7 days prior to use.

Note - Zein is in a medium sized sigma-aldrich tub on the shelving above the
biomaterials section/heated stir plates in the main lab.
