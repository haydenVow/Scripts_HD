Process:

1\. Aliquotted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then
placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath for a minimum of 20 minutes
prior to use:

  1. TrypLE:    40   mL in   1x 50 mL    tube
  2. dPBS (for neutralising)    80   mL in    1x 120 mL    pot
  3. Growth media (for pellet resuspension):    10   mL in    1x 15 mL    tubes
  4. Growth media (for seeding):    90   mL in    1x 120 mL   pot    12:56
  5. Times that all aliquots were placed in the water bath to warm before use  11:28 

Note: if aliquots were placed in water bath at different times, record the
time stamp for each individual solution.




2\. Washed the flask(s) with dPBS.

3\. Added    10   mL tryple to each vessel/well and incubated at 37˚C for
15    min.

Note: Fibroblasts typically require 15-18 minutes of incubation with tryple,
slightly longer than MuSCs.

  1. Start/Finish time for tryple was   11:58   \-  12:13

4\. Neutralised with    10 mL   dPBS (warmed) and combined cell suspension
into a    2x 50 mL   tubes.

5\. Centrifuged at 650 x g for 5 min

  1. Start/Finish time for centrifugation was  12:26  \-  12:31 




6\. Aspirated the supernatant(s)

7\. Resuspended pellet(s) in      6  mL    Growth   media.

8\. Performed a cell count using the haemocytometer and recorded the cell
count data in the Google Doc spreadsheet called 'Cell Count Spreadsheet' (see
link below):

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1DPzKubYxfHmWogVPihC-
SSIBtIylyrBQE5kRX5Z8NtI/edit#gid=0

9\. Total cell number was:    4,728,000  




10\. Seeded ~7k cells per cm2 of the flasks/plates. Note that fibroblasts
prefer to be subcultured closely together.

11\. Volume of cell suspension required for subculture was:    6 mL  

12\. Transfer   6000 µL of cell suspension to the pre-warmed  90 mL Growth
Media.

13\. Transfer cell suspension into (non-gelatin coated)  3x T175 flasks.

14\. Transfer flask/plate(s) to incubate at:

  * [x]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (aviary cells)

Observations/Summary:

\- Cell count was just under 5M which was quite low given that 6M cells were
thawed on the 17th of May

\- Cells were seeded at ~9K per cm2 into 3x T175 flasks to keep the density
high

Results:

  * Results were;
    * [ ]  As Usual (this is a repetitive task)
    * [x]  Unexpected because... low cell count
    * [ ]  Need to be further analysed
    * [ ]  Other (.......)
