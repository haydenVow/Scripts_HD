Process:

  1. Prepared 1.5mL tubes (can be non-sterile) in rack and label with 
    * Quick Exp ID as per Culture ID table entry on the lid
    * "EPIC31448 DDMMYY cells" on the side of each tube
  2. Prepared ViCell tubes in rack and label with Culture ID. Add 375uL MilliQ water to each. 
  3. Retrieve E-flasks from incubator. Wipe down with EtOH and bring into BSC. Order flasks by Quick Exp ID (written in sharpie on each culture label). Retrieved at 12:00 PM
  4. Used P1000 to sample 1mL from each flask and deposit in corresponding 1.5mL tube
  5. Used P1000 to sample 125uL from each flask and deposit in corresponding ViCell tube
  6. Returned E-flasks to incubator and turned on shaker to 120 RPM at 12:30 PM
  7. Turned on ViCell at switch and open software, allow ViCell to initialise 
  8. Loaded ViCell carousel and log in samples using the following naming system:
    * EPIC31448_DDMMYY_CultureID
  9. Ran ViCell using 'Nuvonis suspension' macro (this should be default) and record sample dilution as 1:4
  10. While ViCell is running, placed 1.5mL tubes in benchtop microfuge and spin at 1000xg for 5 minutes
  11. While microfuge is running, labelled 1.5mL tubes:
    * with Quick Exp ID on the lid
    * with "EPIC31448 DDMMYY media" on the side of each tube
  12. Once microfuge finished, used P1000 to aspirate media and deposit into new labelled tubes. 
  13. Retained both sets of 1.5mL tubes and stored in box labelled "EPIC31448" in -20 freezer #184 (top shelf)
  14. Monitored ViCell carousel before leaving. ViCell can be left unattended to perform counts. Before leaving, monitored to ensure samples are loading and unit is functioning as normal

  




Observations & Notes

  * samples were diluted 1:2 to 500uL total rather than 1:4 as specified in process above
  * samples ran on ViCell according to quick exp number rather than culture ID
  * samples potentially ran at dilution 1.0 instead of 2.0, need to manually check data entries from ViCell
