Passage of 20% serum adapted CHOMP clones  
  
Cells were passaged out of confluent wells on cultures 13217 and 13218 into
T25 flasks.

  1. Cells were imaged under 10x magnification using phase imaging on the primovert microscope in the library lab. 
  2. >90% confluent wells were washed with 1mL sterile filtered dPBS 
  3. Wash was removed and cells were covered with 1mL of sterile filtered tryple-EDTA per flask. 
  4. Cells were incubated at 30 degrees at 5% CO2 for 10 minutes. 
  5. Cells were collected into 15mL tubes and wells were washed down with equal volumes of dPBS to tryple 
  6. Washes were also collected to the same tubes 
  7. Cells were centrifuged at 650g for 5 minutes to pellet 
  8. Supernatant was discarded and cells were resuspended in 5mL of growth media (mix13331, D/F12 + 20% FBS + 1xP/S).
  9. Cells were plated into separate T25 flasks and returned to incubator 140 (30 degrees, 5%CO2).

Cells Count average = 4,133,333 cells/mL

5mL of cell suspension (1.03x10^6 cells) was then seeded into 3x T175 flask
containing 30mL of growth media (ID's 13222-13224. 5.16x10^5 cells (2.5mL) was
seeded into 2xT75 flasks containing 12mL of media (ID's 13225-13226).
