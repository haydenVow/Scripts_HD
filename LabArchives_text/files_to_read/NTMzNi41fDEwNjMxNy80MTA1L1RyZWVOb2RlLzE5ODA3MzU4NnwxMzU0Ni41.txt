OR

  

Alternatively plug in your values and manually calculate: (note these volumes
are for primary and secondary staining + DAPI)

PBS:  10 x    1    (number of wells) x    0.4 mL  (volume per well) =   4 mL  

PBST (0.2% Triton-X) : 4 x    1   (number of wells) x    0.4 mL  (volume per
well) =   1.6 mL  

Blocking buffer:  3 x   1    (number of wells) x    0.4 mL  (volume per well)
=   1.2 mL  

Note: blocking buffer is: PBST (0.1% Triton-X + PBS) + 3% bovine serum albumin
(BSA). Kept in the fridge until needed in blocking step

  

3\. Prepared Primary Antibody Mix: :  2.5 µL   Primary #1 MyoG (Santa Cruz)
(1:200  ) + 10  µL   Primary #2 MF20 (DSHB)   (1:50  ) +  0.5  mL Blocking
Buffer

Pipette-mixed antibody mix and stored refrigerated away from light until
needed.




Process:

Permeabilise ( ~ 20 - 30 min)

1\. Removed PBS from each well.

2\. Added  200 - 400 µL PBST (0.2% Triton-X) to each well for 15 min:  : - :
pm

3\. Aspirated PBST for each well.




Blocking ( ~ 1 hr)

1\. Added  200 - 400 µL of blocking buffer (3% BSA in PBST [0.1% Triton-X])
and incubate for 45 minutes - 1hr at RT. (no more than 1 hour):   : - : pm




Single/Simultaneous Primary Antibody staining ( ~ 10 minutes or 2hr)

1\. Removed blocking buffer from each well.

2\. Incubated cells with primary antibody for 90min - 2hrs at RT, or 4ºC
overnight:   : pm

3\. Parafilmed plates and stored at 4ºC in tissue culture lab Fridge.

After this step, all further task should be performed in a dark room. The
vessel should also be wrapped foil when not used.
