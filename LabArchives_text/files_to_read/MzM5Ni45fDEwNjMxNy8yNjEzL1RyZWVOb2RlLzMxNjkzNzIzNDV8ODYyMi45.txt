96-well plate  
7222-DOLLY12-Sheep P13-1of2  
Fridge #74 (Media and gelatin fridge) in a 15 mL falcon tube wrapped in foil  
Thermo (#13)Fibroblast ECM scaffolds seeded with MuSC  
  
Cell FreeThe media will be pre-aliquoted in a 15 mL falcon tube labelled AK
SAT. Place aliquot into in water bath to be pre-warmed. Once warmed transfer
aliquot into a reservoir. Aspirate the growth media from each well (200 uL)
and add 200 uL of fresh E6 media to each well.  
  
  
  




Process:

1\. Retrieve the pre-aliquoted 7 mL from the media and gelatin fridge (#74)
and place in the water bath for at least 10 minutes to be pre-warmed.
Timestamp: 11:16am  

  1. The tube is labelled as AK SAT on the lid and wrapped in foil.

2\. Retrieve the culture plate from the incubator.

3\. Transfer the aliquot in a sterile reservoir.

4\. Aspirate the growth media (200 uL) from each well (18 in total- 2 rows of
9)

5\. Add 200 uL of fresh E6 growth media from the reservoir to each well in the
96-well plate

  1. Please note that there will be media left over which was added to compensate for the loss when using the reservoir.

6\. Return the plate to incuabte at:   12:17pm
