Harvest 6xT75 containing BioNOC II macrocarriers
  
  
Procedure

Harvesting cells with TrypLE:

Before starting this procedure, remove 1 BioNOC carrier from each flask for
DAPI imaging. Also test the pH of discarded media  

  1. Remove media from flask.
  2. Gently rinse the carriers with 10mL dPBS.
  3. To perform enzyme dissociation with TrypLE, add 10 ml to flask and incubate at 30'C for 5-15min. To ensure the carriers stay submerged in the TyrpLE stand the flask upright with the flask lid facing the roof of the incubator.  
* For this experiment all (1) Flasks from each group were TyrpLEd for 5min and all (2) flasks were TrypLEd for 15min.
  4. After the incubation period, transfer the enzymes into a 50mL centrifuge tube.
  5. Add 10mL dPBS into the flask containing the carriers and vigorously mix to dislodge any remaining cells.
  6. Again transfer solution into the corresponding 50mL centrifuge tube containing the TrypLE.
  7. Repeat steps 5 and 6 at least 3 more times with dPBS.
  8. Centrifuge cell suspension, aspirate supernatant and re-suspend cells in lower volume to obtain cell count.

Note: Add sufficient volume of enzyme to completely submerge the carriers (Add
1.5 to 2 ml of enzyme for every 10 carriers in the flask). The flask may have
to be tilted to a corner during the incubation period to completely submerge
the carriers

Passage:

* Cells from flask (1) in the 7,500cell/cm2 seeding condition were kept and seeded into a T25 flask to check the viability of these cells after harvesting

  1. Following the cell count, the correct amount of cells were resuspended in fresh media (6mL)
  2. This cell containing media was then seeded into a T25 flask and the flask placed in an incubator at 30'C and 5% CO2




Results:

Number of carriers in each flask:

15,000 (1): 26, final cell density = 13,646cells/cm2  
15,000 (2): 25, final cell density = 13,936cells/cm2  
7,500 (1): 24, final cell density  = 4,831cells/cm2  
7,500 (2): 24, final cell density  = 5,740cells/cm2  
5,000 (1): 24, final cell density = 3,460cells/cm2  
5,000 (2): 25, final cell density = 3,326cells/cm2

  * Harvested Cell density was slightly less than the seeding density suggesting that the cells did not grow/proliferate at all over the 6 days of incubation. After speaking with people at Esco Aster it was understood that this could be due to a lag phase of adaption by the cells to the 3D surface and that perhaps this experiment was too short. 
  * In regards to TrypLE times, both 5min and 15min produced very similar cell yields in all conditions. For this reason a comfortable incubation time of 10min should be sufficient for harvesting cells from BioNOC in future experiments.   
  
  




Procedure

DAPI Pre-harvest Staining:

* Images saved under 10748

1. 1 BioNOC was taken from each flask using sterile forceps BEFORE the harvest    
2\. Add 1mL 70% Ethanol to each well for 15 minutes  
3\. Remove ethanol and wash with dPBS  
4\. Add DAPI (1:1000) in dPBS for 5min  
5\. Remove all liquid and image

Results:

  * Cells are still visibly attached but it is hard to tell if they have grown
  * The 5,000cells/cm2 condition still looks like it has less cells than the other two groups

Post-harvest Staining:

* Images saved under 10748

1. 1 BioNOC was taken from each flask using sterile forceps AFTER the harvest    
2\. Add 1mL 70% Ethanol to each well for 15 minutes  
3\. Remove ethanol and wash with dPBS  
4\. Add DAPI (1:1000) in dPBS for 5min  
5\. Remove all liquid and image

Results:

  * Some cells were still present on the carriers but the vast majority were detached
  * These images are in line with the images from Esco Aster showing cell attachment post harvest and so can be considered a successful harvest method
