Results  
Initially, 1 x BOBBO MCB vials were seeded (estimated 4.5M cells although a
count was not performed prior to seeding thawed cells). These cells were
cultured for 3 days before reaching confluence and being banked as a WCB of 35
million cells. The doubling time was approximately 22hrs across this period
(see table bellow).  
  
WCB vails were banked as 10x 3.5M vials.
