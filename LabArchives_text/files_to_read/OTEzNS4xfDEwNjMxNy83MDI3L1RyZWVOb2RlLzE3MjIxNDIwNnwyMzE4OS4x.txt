Aim/Purpose


To perform a 12-factor DSD to determine the impact of 12 media ingredients on
the growth of Nuvonis quail suspension cells


Hypothesis


We hypothesise that >1 ingredient at the levels tested will have a
significantly positive impact on Nuvonis quail suspension cell growth


Technical Gap


We have determined that Nuvonis quail suspension cells grow in a 1:1 mixture
of RPMI and HyCell CHO media (see report). However, a high level of
variability was seen between replicates, and we also need to further reduce
the concentration of HyCell CHO due to it's proprietary nature and cost. We
therefore want to screen a number of ingredients to improve the consistency
and rate of proliferation of cells in a RPMI/HyCell mix.


Method/Procedure


  1. D0: Prepare working stocks of each factor 
  2. D0: Perform media mixing on OT2 to generate 29 media conditions. Mix control media conditions manually. 
  3. D0: Add media to plates on OT2 and seed cells manually 
  4. D0: Image plates on Zaber (phase, 5X)
  5. D2: Image plates on Zaber (phase, 5X)
  6. D5: Perform live/dead stain and dilutions on OT2.
  7. D5: Image plates on Zaber (phase + AF488 + DAPI, 5X)
  8. D5: Run images through Mia Analysis macro for suspension cells 
  9. D6: Export macro output to spreadsheets to determine cells/mL. Perform statistical analysis in Prism.
