Process

  1. Aliquoted 2600 uL of Freestyle 293 medium and 8600 uL of all other media types into 7 x 15 mL tubes. Added growth factors (IGF & EGF) and placed in bead bath to warm. 
  2. Ran OT2 protocol for filling plates with media (see attached protocol file and plate maps below)
    1. Need to increase dead volume of media to 500 uL for future runs - can only do n=7 for this run due to media not being dispensed for the last 5 wells 
    2. Need to split media into 2 x 5 mL aliquots for each media to avoid the non-sterile part of the pipette arm touching the media (or use 50 mL tubes)
  3. Parafilmed plates and placed in fridge for seeding tomorrow
