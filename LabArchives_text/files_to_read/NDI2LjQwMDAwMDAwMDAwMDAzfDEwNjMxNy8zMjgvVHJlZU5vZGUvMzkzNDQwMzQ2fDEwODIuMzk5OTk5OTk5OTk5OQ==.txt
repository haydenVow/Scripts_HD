The serial passaging and expansion of myogenic stem cells has not been
demonstrated using Trypsin to harvest cells from Cytodex 1 microcarriers. This
is essential information for the sciences and production teams in order to
have confidence in the use of this method for everyday culture purposes.

This experiment will expand a myogenic stem cell line from E125 to E500 to
E2000 over 2 weeks. The culture conditions will be standard: fill volume ~25%
of nominal volume, microcarrier concentration 4.5 mg/mL, seeding density ~3
cells/microcarrier (~3,000 cells/cm2), harvest density ~12 cells/microcarrier
(~12,000 cells/cm2).

We also need more data on harvest process consistency, as efficiencies with
the Trypsin method have ranged between 20% and 80% recently. We can seed 3x
E125, passage into 3x E500, passage into 3x E2000 so that we get replicates at
each harvest.
