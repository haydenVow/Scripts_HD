Media/Reagents used:

NameDetails  
  
  
  
PFA  
5 (4 mL + excess) mL; Alq. - 1988  
  
dPBS40 mL (32 mL + excess); Mix - 7046  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
40 wells in total

100 uL of PFA in each well = 4 mL

200 uL of dPBS x 4 (once to wash out growth media, twice to wash out the PFA
and once again to top up the fixed cells) = 32 mL

  




Process:

Fixing ( ~ 20 - 30 min)

  1.  Removed media from each well and wash with PBS @ 11:42 - 11:48 am , 11:49 - 11:59 am
  2.  Added  100 µL PFA for 15 min:  12:08 - 12:23 pm 
  3. Removed PFA (and add in PFA waste container) and wash wells with   200 µL PBS twice (refer to steps below)
  4. Parafilm the assay plate and place in fridge.

First PBS wash: 12:23 - 12:30 pm, wait 5 mins.

Second PBS wash: 12:30 - 12:35 pm, wait 5 mins.

Final addition of PBS @ 12:35 pm.
