## Making the Liver Growth Medium:

Amount: 20mL of supplement and 70uL of dexamethasone for every 500mL of
Williams Medium E (WME).

1\. 200mL of growth medium (Williams Medium E + hepatocyte supplement +
dexamethasone) was made up containing:

  * 200mL WME 
  * 8mL hepatocyte supplement 
  * 28uL dexamethasone

2\. Filter complete media with a 0.2um filter.

3\. Aliquoted 55mL of the growth medium and added 550 uL  P/S




Process:

1\. Aliquotted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then
placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath for a minimum of 20 minutes
prior to use:

  1. TrypLE:    15   mL in  1x 50mL     tubes
  2. dPBS (for neutralising)   30 mL in   1x 50mL   tubes
  3. Growth media (for pellet resuspension):   15  mL in   1x  50mL tube    tubes
  4. Growth media (for seeding):   45  mL in   50mL tube     tubes
  5. Growth media (for 50%):   25 mL in   50mL tube     tubes
  6. Times that all aliquots were placed in the water bath to warm before use  13:50 

Note: if aliquots were placed in water bath at different times, record the
time stamp for each individual solution.




## 50% Feed

 ~~0\. Take microscope images of the culture(s) at 5x,10x, 20x.  ~~no images
taken due to ranger issue

1\. Removed vessel(s) from the incubator.   16:07

2\. Removed 50% of the supernatant.

3\. Added 50% of the appropriate working volume for the vessel.

4\. Returned to the incubator.   16:03




## Passage

 ~~0\. Take microscope images of the culture(s) at 5x,10x, 20x.~~ No
microscope images were taken due to ranger issue. Images of the microscope
screen were instead taken and have been attached below.

1\. Removed vessel(s) from the incubator.  16:04

2\. Washed the flask(s) with dPBS.

3\. Added  10 mL tryple to each vessel/well and incubated at 37˚C for  16:05
-16:24  min.

\- After 15 minutes, the tryplised cells were pippeted up and down to help
detachment from the plate surface

Note: Fibroblasts typically require 15-18 minutes of incubation with tryple,
slightly longer than MuSCs.

4\. Neutralised with    5mL (per plate)   dPBS (warmed) and combined cell
suspension into    3 x 50mL falcon   tube.

5\. Centrifuged at 650 x g for 5 min

  1. Start/Finish time for centrifugation was  16:33   \-  16:38   




6\. Aspirated the supernatant(s)

7\. Resuspended pellet(s) in      5  mL  alpaca liver growthmedia.

8\. Performed a cell count using the haemocytometer and recorded the cell
count data in widget or the Google Doc spreadsheet called 'Cell Count
Spreadsheet' (see link below):

 ~~9\. Total cell number was:  
~~

 ~~10\. Seeded ~7k cells per cm2 of the flasks/plates. Note that fibroblasts
prefer to be subcultured closely together. ~~ ~~~~

11\. Each cell suspension was resuspended in 20mL of growth medium.

13\. Transfer each cell suspension into 2x (non-coated)   100mm
flasks/plates.

14\. Transfer flask/plate(s) to incubate at: : am/pm  

  * [X]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (aviary cells)
