Protocol


Passaging Suspension Cells - E-flasks

Morning

  1. Turn on the water bath and set temperature to 37°C.
  2. Retrieve a sample from each suspension flask in culture. See VSOP-082.
  3. Perform a cell count and record the total number of cells and the number of viable cells for each culture sampled.
    1. Cells are usually passaged when they reach a density of around 3,000,000 cells/mL.
    2. Cells are passaged by diluting them in fresh 37°C warm medium.
  4. Post on slack channel regarding the number of available cells.

Afternoon

  1. Place the aliquot(s) of growth media into a pre-warmed water bath and warm them in the water bath for at least 20 minutes before use.
  2. Transfer the growth media aliquot(s) and flask(s) required for passaging into the BSC, ensuring to wipe down containers with 70% EtOH during the transfer.
    1. Refer to Table A for the appropriate volumes of growth media for each E-flask type which will depend on the quantity of cells in the culture(s).
  3. Transfer the required volume of cell suspension (see Table A) from the exisiting culture(s) to the required volume of fresh growth media.
    1. If using a new flask: 
      1. Pour required volume of warm growth media (minus the volume of the cell suspension) into new E-flask. 
      2. Add in cell suspension.
    2. If re-using a flask:
      1. Pour out contents of flask into a 2L bottle. 
      2. Use a serological pipette and some of the previous media wash down sides of flask, and add back into 2L bottle.
      3. Use sterile PBS to perform a final rinse of E-Flask and discard the PBS into waste.
      4. Pour required volume of warm growth media (minus the volume of the cell suspension) into E-flask. 
      5. Add in cell suspension.
  4. Transfer the newly seeded flasks to an incubator at 37°C, 5% CO2, and the recommended shaking speed for at least 2 minutes to evenly distribute the cells. See Table B for required shaking speeds.
  5. Place harvested cells (remaining cell suspension in 2L bottle) to a static 37°C, 5% CO2 incubator.
  6. Continue incubation at 37°C, 5% CO2 and the recommended RPM until the cells require a passage as outlined in step 3 of this VSOP.
