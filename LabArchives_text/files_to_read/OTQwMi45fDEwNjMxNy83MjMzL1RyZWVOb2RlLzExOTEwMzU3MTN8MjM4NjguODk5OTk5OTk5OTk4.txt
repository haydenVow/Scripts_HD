Process:

1\. Aliquotted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then
placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath for a minimum of 20 minutes
prior to use:

  1.  Growth media (for seeding):   180 mL in  1 x 180 ml  container
  2.  Time that all aliquot was placed in the water bath to warm before use:   15:23 pm 

2\. Collected the cryovial from Liquid Nitrogen storage & place in foam
floater in water bath for 5 min  

Location where cryovial was collected from:

 Homer  OR Dewer 1: Brew

Tower/Bucket #2  

Box/Cane #6  

Vial location:A1  

Vial ID(s):3635-8697-vl-1of120  
  

  

  




3\. Ethanol sprayed & transferred the vial(s) to the BSC.

4\. Added  1 ml of Growth Media (to generate a total volume of 1mL in the
cryovial) to the cryovial, resuspended the cell suspension gently to reduce
osmotic shock.

5\. Collected the entire 1mL of cell suspension & transfer into the pre-warmed
15 ml tube of Growth Media (5mL).




6\. Using a 10mL serological pipette, resuspended & distributed 1 x vial
evenly in each of the  180 ml of pre-warmed Growth Media (prepared in Step 2
and each used to seed 6 x T175)

8\. Transfered   30 mL to each T175   flask/well.

9\. Transfered flask/plate(s) to incubate at:

  * [ ]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (aviary cells)
  * [ X] 30ºC, 5% CO2 (reptilian cells)




SOPs used:

  * SOP_Thawing Cells Into Adherent Culture V_02
