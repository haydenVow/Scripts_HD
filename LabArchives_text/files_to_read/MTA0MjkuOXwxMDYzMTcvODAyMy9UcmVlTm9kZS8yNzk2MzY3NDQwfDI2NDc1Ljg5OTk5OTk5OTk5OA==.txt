RELATED TO OKR:  Providing texture to quail cell suspensions pre harvest

AIM/PURPOSE: To assess if we can precipitate Nuvonis cell suspensions using
flocculants

HYPOTHESIS: Clarification techniques from scientific literature can be applied
in an industrial context (at scale) to flocculate cells. The flocculation will
provide texture to the centrifugate due to cells excreting ECM after
flocculation (semi-adherent state)
