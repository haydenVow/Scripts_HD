Process:

  1. Collected  25 mL  aliquot of  Growth Media from fridge (library lab fridge 104 
  2. Placed in water bath   14:45    

  3. Paused shaker in incubator 68 by pressing the "play" button on the controller on the side wall of the incubator 
  4. Collected E125 culture vessel from clamp on shaker, ethanol sprayed and brought into BSC 
  5. Using a 25 mL serological pipette, gently pipette-mixed culture before moving the entire suspension to a fresh 50 mL falcon tube (keep E125 flask sterile and in hood - the culture will be returned to this flask after feed) 
  6. Centrifuged at 650 g for 5 min.  14:57 - 15:02  

  7. Aspirated supernatant, taking care to not disrupt or aspirate pellet 
  8. Re-suspended culture in 500 uL of growth media to total of 780 uL
  9. Took 20 uL aliquot and performed cell count, recording count in this spreadsheet https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1YuTvXJXQQMIMwRZGeqNjdi20WeURg5FpM-1TJ-zrb1c/edit#gid=1104649984
    1. Cell count:  No particles of 10-20 um diameter and round morphology observed
  10. Replaced with fresh, warmed media
  11. Gently pipette-mixed culture again before moving back to E125 flask
  12. Returned vessel to incubator and replaced in clamp. Pressed "play" at side of incubator (should be shaking at 130 RPM).  15:10
