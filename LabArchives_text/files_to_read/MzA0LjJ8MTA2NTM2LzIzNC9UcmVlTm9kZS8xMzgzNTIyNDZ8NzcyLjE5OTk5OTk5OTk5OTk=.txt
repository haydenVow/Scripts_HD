In House: Set 6 - 48hr E-flask 6x(1xE250) Harvest


Experiment Plan:




Procedure - E250 Harvest

  1. Pre-weigh 50mL centrifuge tubes recording the weights on the tubes and clearly label with the condition name (one for each flask in each experimental condition = 6)
  2. Pour the contents of each E-flask into their corresponding pre-weighed centrifuge tube. 
  3. Using a serological pipette dispense 10mL dPBS into each flask as a final wash. Add this dPBS to the pre-weighed centrifuge tube with corresponding condition.
  4. Once all aggregates and dPBS has been added to the centrifuge tubes, Centrifuge at 700 x g for 5 minutes.````
  5. Gently remove centrifuge tubes from the machine, ensuring not to disturb the cell pellets. Aspirate as much supernatant as possible from the tubes. Discard supernatant. Remove as much remaining supernatant with a 1mL pipette.
  6. Spin these tubes once more at 700 x g for 5 minutes
  7. Remove any supernatant present with a 1mL pipette
  8. Weigh the cell pellets

  


VitC 50ug/mL - All conditions 3x(1xE250)
VitC 5mg/mL - All conditions 3x(1xE250)


Observations with pellets:  
Static: one solid powdery looking pellet - but the top was very runny (can see
cells lifting off the top of pellet as removing supernatant)  
Intermittant Shaking: multiple fragments of varying size. Hard to extract
supernatant without sucking up the smaller fragments.  
Constant shaking: the supernatant looked cloudy after the spin (cell debris?)
and like the static formed one solidy powdery looking pellet - but top was
very running. The bottom of the pellet shows some appearance of the little
aggregates formed in the E-flask.
