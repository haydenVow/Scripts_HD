Bag Inflation:

\- Air overlay was switched on with the clamps still attached onto the lines
and as a result air started to escape from the cpc connector which was
downstream of the filter. Given air was escaping out this could have
potentially compromised the bag sterility.

Note: This speciific bag came with CPC connectors instaed of the standard OPTA
connectors. Given all the filters used for the 2000L bag installation come
with OPTA connectors, these couldn't be used. Therefore to circumvent this the
OPTA connector attachment was removed from the filter and a CPC connector was
attached instead. This was done for 2 filters and they were placed into an
autoclave bag and steam sterilised at 121'C for 30 minutes.
