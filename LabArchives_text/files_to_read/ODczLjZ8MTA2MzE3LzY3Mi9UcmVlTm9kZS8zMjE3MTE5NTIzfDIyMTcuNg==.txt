Process:

1\. Aliquotted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then
placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath for a minimum of 20 minutes
prior to use:

  1. Growth media (for seeding):    2   mL in    15 mL    tube
  2. Times that all aliquots were placed in the water bath to warm before use  10:21

Note: if aliquots were placed in water bath at different times, record the
time stamp for each individual solution.




2\. Retrieve 6-well plate from shaker plate and transfer to the BSC.

3\. Filter the media containing suspended fibroblasts through a 70um sterile
filter unit into a sterile 50 mL falcon tube.

4\. Take 2x 10ul sample of the filtered cell suspension and perform a cell
count using the haemocytometer and recorded the cell count data in the Google
Doc spreadsheet called 'Cell Count Spreadsheet' (see link below):

  1. Total cell number (Count 1) was:   16,000
  2. Total cell number (Count 2) was:   8,000  

  3. Average count:   12,000      

5\. Spin down the filtrate (single cells in the media) at 3000 rpm for 5
minutes to pellet the cells.

  1. Start/Finish time for centrifugation was   10:19   -  10:24

6\. Aspirate the spent media (supernatant) and re suspend the cell pellet in
fresh media at 100-500K cells per mL- this will depend on the cell count (the
higher the better).

7\. Volume of cell suspension required for subculture was:    2 mL  

8\. Transfer cell suspension into (non-gelatin coated)   6-well   plate.

7\. Transfer the new flask to incubate on the shaker platform at 100 RPM and
leave the cells at constant agitation until the next passage/cell count.
