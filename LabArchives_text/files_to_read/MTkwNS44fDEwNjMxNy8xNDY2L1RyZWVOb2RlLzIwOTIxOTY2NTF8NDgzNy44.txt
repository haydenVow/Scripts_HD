## Performed by: Shaleen  




Growth Media:

  * [x]  DMEM/F12 + 20% FBS + 1X P/S + P38i (10uM

Total media required: 30mL

Total p38i required: 15uL




Culture IDs to feed

Vessel type(s)  
Vessel ID  
  
E250 (incubator 68)  
ID: 6884  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  




Process:

1\.  Aliquotted   30mL  mL of  Growth Media into  1 x 50 mL   tube(s).

Placed in water bath   16:23  

2\. Stopped the shaker and removed cultures from the incubator before
restarting the shaker  17:13  

3\. Placed suspension flask(s) inside the BSC and allowed to sit static for
3-5 minutes to allow microcarriers to settle to the base of the flask.

2\. Carefully removed  50  % of supernatant from the flask(s) by pipetting
slowly and following the meniscus with the pipette tip so as to avoid placing
the pipette tip near the microcarriers at the base of the flask(s).

3\. Replaced with  15 mL (per well/per vessel) of   growth  media.

4\. Returned vessel to incubate at:   17:19 , incubator #  68   , ensured the
shaker was shaking at 110rpm.

  * [x]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (aviary cells)
