RELATED TO OKR: PPP_Q4_KR2_Characterise 2 x QMS-compliant suspension-adapted
fibroblast clones from our chosen species

AIM/PURPOSE: To investigate what impact varying levels of UVB irradiation and
varying concentrations of a P53 inhibitor have on short-term crocodile
fibroblast viability.

HYPOTHESIS: We hypothesise that the viability and growth of cells exposed to 5
mj/cm2 of UVB irradiation will be unaffected, while 300 mj/cm2 UV will cause
immediate cell death (based off previous results Mutagenesis Trial 2). We
hypothesise that no concentration of the P53 inhibitor will be detrimental to
cell growth and survival.

RESULTS SUMMARY:

  1. 5 - 15 mj/cm2 did not appear to have an impact on cell growth or morphology 
  2. 30 - 60 mj/cm2 appeared to have a moderate impact on cell growth and mild impact on morphology 
  3. 300 mj/cm2 appeared to have a severe impact on both cell growth and morphology 
  4. The survival and growth of cells in 10 uM P53i, 30 uM P53i, and DMSO supplemented medium conditions did not appear to differ from cells in the control growth medium. Given this result, we hypothesise that the low count of cells in 30 nM P53i medium was due to cells being aspirated during the passage
  5. The poor survival and growth of cells in UV control may have been due to the heat stress from exposure to the UV lamp. This result also suggests that cells in UV-exposure conditions are likely to also be impacted from heat, not solely the UV-irradiation. 

CONCLUSIONS: Our hypothesis around UV-exposure was confirmed, as the survival
and growth of cells exposed to <15 mj/cm2 of UVB irradiation did not appear to
be affected, while 300 mj/cm2 resulted in mass cell death. Our hypothesis
around P53i was mostly supported, however the outlier results seen in cells
treated with 30 nM P53i was unexpected. As stated in results, this is assumed
to have been a result of cell pellet aspiration, rather than the P53i. While
we had replicate wells (n=4) to monitor cell confluence and morphology, the
replicates were combined during passaging for cell counts due to labor and
time constraints. Therefore, we cannot apply statistical analysis or draw
conclusive results from this experiment .  

NEXT STEPS:

  1. Lily and Marie will plan a follow-up experiment where cells will be exposed to UV-irradiation while in the presence of a P53-inhibitor. The proposed combinations are:
    *   
Treatment  
  
P53i (uM)UV (mj/cm2)  
Condition 1 10300  
Condition 210150  
Condition 330300  
Condition 430150  
Control 10300  
Control 2300  
Control 300  
  2. Set up a safer method for UV-irradiating cells which does not involve a scientist being exposed to UV-B irradiation
