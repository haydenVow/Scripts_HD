Clones on culture 12766 were passaged by hand.  
  
Briefly.

  1. Cultures were imaged using the Primovert microscope under 5x objective, PHASE imaging. Images were inspected manually for a confluence estimate. Wells that appeared to have >90% confluence were selected for continuous passaging (https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1yQD_JrhzktpQd0vaCt2B5OskKgl9SipLLab3WZ9v7ZU/edit#gid=1517361241&range=234:238) 
  2. Media was aspirated from these wells
  3. Wells were washed with 100uL of dPBS 
  4. Wash was removed and cells were covered with 100uL of Tryple
  5. Cells were left to incubate for 10-12 minutes at 30 degrees, 5% CO2. 
  6. 100uL of tryple volume from each well was then transferred to a new well containing 1L of growth media on a new 24 well plate.
  7. The new culture was returned to incubator 140 (culture 12917)
