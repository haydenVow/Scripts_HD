Aim/Purpose


Perform a suspension SCC run of the three best performing F_DOLLY12 cells in
CD-CHO media


Hypothesis


Single DOLLY_12 fibroblasts sorted in 384 wells that have been adapted to
suspension over 30 days will survive in suspension such that we will attain â‰¥1
clonal cell line.  


Technical Gap


SCC, as of yet, has not been performed on suspension adapted cell lines. There
are currently three DOLLY12 fibroblast cell lines that have continued to
survive until day 40 in suspension which will be seeded into 2x ULA 384 well
plates for each cell line (i.e., 6 conditions in total). As these cells have
survived in suspension culture conditions for greater than 30 days they
ideally should be adapted and proliferate in ULA plates.

Notes  
  
30-Sep-2021D-0Thaw 3M DOLLY12 fibroblast cells The first four steps have been
performed in a separate experiment (this experiment will only take a small
sample of those cells ~50K). See here  
30-Sep-2021 - 14-Oct-2021D-0 - D-15Feed and passage fibroblasts for scale up  
14-Oct-2021D-0Seed suspension cultures  
14-Oct-2021 - 23-Nov-2021D-0 - D-40Feed, stain and image suspension culture  
23-Nov-2021D0 FACS sort into 6 x 384-well plates (two for each condition):  
Three culture's in total:  
\- 8639-F_DOLLY12-Sheep P11-1of3 (Rep #1)  
\- 8640-F_DOLLY12-Sheep P11-2of3 (Rep #2)  
\- 8641-F_DOLLY12-Sheep P11-3of3 (Rep #3)  
  
All three cultures are the same condition, albeit just being a different
replicate.  
  
Their seed media is:  
CD CHO +10% Knockout serum replacement + 1:100 anti-clumping agent + 4mM
L-glutamine +  100ng/mL each FGF, IGF1 + 1x P/S  
  

  1. Prepare 6 x ULA plates with fresh adherent growth medium (See media composition above) *Each plate will contain the same GM, however each cell sample will be sorted into 2 plates.
  2. Prepare 20 mL FACS Buffer
  3. Retrieve fibroblasts from E125 flasks (~50K cells per condition)
  4. Take to Garvan and sort 
  5. Centrifuge plates
  6. Transport plates back to Vowse, place in incubator at 37'C

D10Zaber scan plates  
Top up wells with 20 uL per well fresh growth mediumCheck if any wells are
over-confluent. If so, perform picking on D11 and adjust next time to do
picking earlier. It not, can wait and scan again in a couple of days.  
  
  
D~11Pick high confluence wells from 384-well to (ULA) 96-well plates  
Generate pick-list through Hoechst-staining and imaging cells on Zaber then
running through macro. Remove Hoechst after to avoid damaging cells?  
  
  
When confluent, expand top clones from 96-well plate to  (ULA) 24-well plate  
  
  
  
When confluent, expand top clones from 24-well plate to (ULA) 6-well plate  
  
  
  
When confluent, expand top clones from 6-well plate to (ULA) T25 flasks  
  
  
  
When confluent, expand top clones from T25 flasks to T75 flasks or 125 shake
flasks  
  
  
  
When confluent, expand top clones from T75 flasks to T175 flasks or 250 shake
flasks  
  
  
  
When confluent, expand top clones from T175 flasks to Multi-layered cell
factory flasks or 2L shake flasks  
  
  
  
  
Generate MCB_2 of successful clonal populations.
