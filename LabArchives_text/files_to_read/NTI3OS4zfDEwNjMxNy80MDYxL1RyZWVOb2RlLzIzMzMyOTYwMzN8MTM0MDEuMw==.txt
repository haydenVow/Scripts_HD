## Remove the Stimulation Lead Wire

1\. Removed the hook test clips from the electrode connection pins on the
culture dish lid for Plate 1 (____)  
  
The test hook can be released from the pin by squeezing the spring loaded test
hook handle. It is best not to touch the metal electrode pins while doing
this. Hold the plastic culture dish lid for stability. If any wires become
dislodged and the operator is unsure about reattachment, contact experiment
owner for assistance   Jared - 0420881185




## Imaging

1\. Imaged BOTH PLATES, taking whole well images of every well using the zaber
time  

For information on how to use the zaber, refer to:

ad19527eee9e42ed9db96faa911d6536

Tips for imaging the 12WP are to use 8x8 imaging sites in the HSC site
generator, remembering to change the spacing rule to field of view with 60 um
spacing. Remember to build the MM List in the HSC site generator and confirm
the number of images expected (usually >700) in the Mult-D Acq.




Media Change

1\. Retrieved   48 mL  of  E6 Media from a 90 mL shared gains and chains
aliquot in   1x 120 mL  pot from the biomaterials fridge.  
  
2\. Aliquots placed in water bath  14:27  

3\. Removed  100% of supernatant from vessel.

4\. Replaced with  2mL (per well/per vessel) of   E6 diff media.

5\. Returned vessels to incubate and connected the test hooks back up to the
electrode pins on the culture dish lid FOR PLATE 1 (_____) ONLY so that each
set of hooks connects to the corresponding wire colour and so that the black
hooks are aligned on the left side of each well and the red hooks on the right
(see wiring setup reference image below)   14:45
