Prepare Cells for nucleofection

  1. Cells used were of a low passage number, thawed and out of frozen storage for at least 3 days and appear happy and live. [Cell culture ID:10381, 10382, 10383, 10384, 10385 ] 
  2. Media was removed from cells, PBS washed with 10 mL per flask and triplised with 10 mL tryple per flask
  3. tryple was neutralised with     10  mL PBS per flask
  4. Cells were placed in a falcon tube 
  5. cells were centrifuged for 5 minutes at 300g.
  6. supernatant was removed and cells were resuspended in 5mL of growth media (NO P/S)
  7. cell count was performed under a hemocytometer after a 10uL aliquot was taken and diluted using trypan blue (ratio: )
  8. The number of cells required for the experiment was determined. 0.4 x 10^5 cells required per well.
    1. Cells for PTEN + PABPC1 transfection = 0.4*10^6 x 16 = 6.4x0^6
    2. Cells for IGFBP4 transfection = 0.4*10^6 x 16 = 6.4x10^6
    3. Cells for Control (Cas9, no guide) = 0.4*10^6 x 13 = 5.2x10^6  
We therefore need 18 x 10^6 cells  

Total cell number harvested = 22 200 000 cells

  * 6 well plates were prepared to receive nucleofected cells based on total cell number counted (400,000 cells/well, ideally 8 plates total). Wells required were filled with 3 mL of DMEM/F12 + 20% FBS WITHOUT ANTIBIOTICS! 
  * 6 well plates were placed in the incubator (30 degrees, 5% CO2) to warm plates with media []. 




## *Ensure cell count is performed before determining how much of the
following reagents to make

Plan: 6 well plate nucleofections. 15 wells per guide and 18 wells for
controls

Prepare guides/cas9/Cas9 electroporation enhancer

  1. IGFBP4, PTEN and PABPC1 guides in TE buffer (44 uM) (stored at -20) were retrieved from the freezer
  2. Made up Cas9 mix. *Below is a 1 x mix for 1 well, multiply by number of wells you intend to make x 1.2 to get total volume required for experiment.

3\. Make up the Cas9 + guide mix. Below is a 1 x mix for 1 well, multiply by

4\. Incubated mix for 10-20 min, (tubes were left in the bench hood for 10
minutes to incubate from [TIMESTAMP]

5\. while incubating, the electroporation enhancer was prepared.

  1. Buffer was removed from -20 freezer and thawed using body temperature. 
  2. Mxes for each guide were made up to 10.8 uM solutions using 1 x TE buffer. *Below is a 1 x mix for 1 well, multiply by number of wells you intend to make x 1.2 to get total volume required for experiment.

Nucleofection

  1. The required cell number (4.054mL) was pipetted into a 15mL sterile falcon tube
  2. Cells were centrifuged for 5 mins at 300g at room temp [15:04]
  3. Supernatant was removed
  4. The pellet was resuspended in    1     mL 1x PBS (18 x10^6 cells/mL) 
  5. Three 1.5mL sterile eppendorf tubes were set up inside the BSC and labelled 1-3. volumes of cell suspension in dPBS were transferred to each tube as per the guide below. 
    1. Tube 1 - PTEN + PABPC1:  356
    2. Tube 2 - IGFBP4:  356
    3. Tube 3 - Control:  289
  6. The cells were centrifuged at 300g for 5 mins at room temp (HINGE OUT IN CENTRIFUGE)
  7. The supernatant was removed from each tube. It is important to remove as much as possible. Use a 1 mL tip to remove most of the supernatant and then switch to a 200 uL pipette to remove a little more if necessary. Do not disturb the pellet.
  8. To each Eppendorf tube the following mix was prepared, R buffer added first.
