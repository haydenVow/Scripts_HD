BASE MEDIA PREPARATION:

HYCELLCHO + SUPPLEMENT MEDIA PREPARATION:

  1. Hycell Cho media was prepared for the suspension culture vessels below, 
    1. 6x96 well plates per Knockout condition, 
    2. 4x50mL bioreactor tube per knockout condition, 
    3. 1x50mL bioreactor tube for nucleofection control. 
  2. x96 well plates (200 uL per well) = 116 mL
  3. 5x mini bioreactor tubes (5 mL per tube) = 25 mL
  4. Total = 141
  5. 1.1 x 179 = ~155 mL, Hycell Cho media was prepared using the following volumes in the range below:

DMEM/F12 + 20% FBS + 1 x P/S media was aliquoted for adherent cultures  

  * 3xT75cm plate per knockout  condition/nucleofection control.  
  * 2x 96 wp, 1 for each knockout condition (50uL per well).

3 x T75 plates (12mL per plate) = 36mL

2x 96 well plates(200uL per well) = 38.4mL

Total = 74.4 x 1.1 = ~82 mL

  




PREPARE FACS BUFFER

  1. 6mL of FACS buffer, prepared one week earlier during nucleofection round 1 (see epic 29990), was used for this round of FACS sorting. 




OBSERVATIONS

The media was aliquoted across the 96 well plates which were then placed in
the fridge at 4 degrees until use during FACS
