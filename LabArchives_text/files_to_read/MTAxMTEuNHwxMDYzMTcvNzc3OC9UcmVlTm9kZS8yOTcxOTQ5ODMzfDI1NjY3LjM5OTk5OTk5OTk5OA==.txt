50  % media changed on vessel(s)




Relevant Images/Figures (if applicable):

Took images prior to feeding.

I don't know how much media was in the 500 ml pot that contained the
aliquotted media. After removing the 300 ml of media, I proceeded to add the
complete volume contained in the 500ml pot, assuming there was exactly 300 ml
