Procedure

Perform thaw using below volumes:

                                                                       

### Note: Fibroblasts do NOT require Gelatin coated Flasks, and do NOT require
p38i.

  

  1. Extract required growth media into aliquots as listed in the table above and place into a heated 37C water bath for 20 minutes.   
Time in water bath: 10:04am  

  2. Select the vial/s for thawing. Note the location of the vial in Liquid Nitrogen(LN) Dewer.  
Path: Stockyard v1 > Frozen Cultures > Select Vial/s (Use highest number
first, ie 62of62)  
Number of Vials for thawing: 1  
Dewer: Brew  
Frozen Culture ID/s: 2338  
Tower #: 2  
Box #: 2  
Position #: G5  

  3. Obtain selected number of cryovial/s from LN Dewar and thaw in the 37'C water bath on a foam floater for a maximum of 5 minutes.  
*NOTE: Ensure to wear PPE and work swiftly whilst performing this this task. Ensure to wear cryogloves and face shield when handling the liquid nitrogen dewar. Ask a Vowzer for help if required.  
`Time stamp`: 10:15am - 10:20am  

  4. Spray and wipe the cryovial and growth media thoroughly with 70% EtOH and transfer into the Biohazard Safety Cabinet (BSC).
  5. Slowly add 500uL of growth media into the/each vial. This will produce a total of 1mL cell suspension per vial.
  6. Resuspend the cells gently and transfer all contents from the vial to the bottom of a 50mL falcon tube. *NOTE: Dispensing suspension of cells on the sides of the tube will risk loss of cells in Step 11.
  7. Add an additional 500uL of growth media to each vial to collect remaining cells and add into the centrifuge tube. A total of 1.5mL will be in each vial.
  8. Resuspend cells thoroughly and immediately extract 50uL into a microcentrifuge tube.
  9. Perform cell count (Refer to VSOP-007) from collected sample and use the Cell Counting Spreadsheet  to enter data.

11.Prepare 4 mL of media+cells per condition type to seed a concentration of
7000 cells/cm2 for a column each (not including bottom and top rows, i.e. 6
wells) in 4 x 96-well plates. (i.e. 16,000 cells/mL or 64,000 cells per 4mL).  
Conditions tested:  
1\. In house media lot 1 + 10% FBS + 1% P/S  
2\. In house media lot 2 + 10% FBS + 1% P/S  
3\. Commercial media + 10% FBS + 1% P/S  
4\. Freeze-thawed  commercial media + 10% FBS + 1% P/S  
  
12\. Seed 140ul/condition into each required well as follows for a total of 4
plates:

13\. Transfer the pre-warmed flasks from the 37C incubator into the BSC.  
14\. Seed remaining cells into a T75 flask. Seeding density: 8010 cells/cm2.
12mL of PRF DMEM/F12 +10% FBS (P/S free)  
14\. Add required volume of growth media to each flask, ensuring the entire
surface is coated. Use the 'Bec Drop' to lay down the flasks.``

15\. Transfer and incubate overnight at 37C.  
`Time of incubation` : 11:00am  

Incubation Conditions:

        [x]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)  
        [  ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (avian cells)
