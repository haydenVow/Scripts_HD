Process:

  

  
  
  
Starting deck state  
  
  

Startup and calibration:

  1. Switched on HEPA filter (top of robot, switch on left) and the OT2 robot.
  2. Wiped the base/desk of the robot with 70% (v/v) EtOH. Do not wipe the sides (clear acrylic panels) with ethanol. OT2 should be treated like a BSC for maintaining sterility. Spray and wipe any items with ethanol before placing into OT2. 
  3. Connected to the robot from a lab computer by using the OpenTrons app. 
  4. Uploaded desired protocol to the app. Download the protocol file you need from Google Drive:  https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/12S3szo_L9g5Z79TkIwZo8bcm2bOdGSzG.
  5. Clicked  Proceed to calibrate. 
  6. Arranged labware and reagents on the OT2 as shown in the deck layout. 
  7. Calibrated to labware by following the instructions on the app and then ran the protocol.  

Start time:   12:31 pm

Summary of protocol:

  *   

End time:       13:51 pm

  

Termination and cleaning:

  1. Once the protocol is complete, discarded tips in the yellow biowaste bin. Sprayed and wiped the trash tray with ethanol before returning it to the robot. Liquid waste should be collected in bottles, and PFA waste should be discarded into the PFA waste container. OT2 reservoirs are reusable. They should be sprayed with Viraclean if they contained cell suspensions and then washed in eucalyptus disinfectant. Then they need to be soaked in water, dried, and autoclaved.'
  2. Removed all labware from OT2 and wipe the base/deck of the OT2 with ethanol. The pipette head can also be cleaned with 70% ethanol. Wiped the sides (clear acrylic panels) with working solution of bleach (10-15%) and then dried with a RediWipe.   

  




Observations/Summary:

\- Many OT miscalibrations!

\- Pipette tip hit falcon tubes and stopped the program multiple times

\- We calibrated the tip perfectly for A1 of the second 15 mL falcon tube
rack, however this resulted in the first tube rack not being calibrated
correctly and the pipette tip holder hit the side of condition 12 falcon tube.

\- Other things to note were the slow speeds of aspiration and dispensing even
though these are the same settings as the ones that Derek used in his script.
The robot also spends a lot of time after dispensing tips in the trash just
hovering and not moving. In general, this protocol seems to be a lot slower
that the media mixing one.

\- To alleviate th  
e issues with calibration, we had to manually tilt each falcon tube so the
pipette tip would go into the centre. Not sure if this is due to the labware
we used (in-house 3D-printed), the specs for this labware being inaccurate, or
the OT machine itself having a skewed idea of where everything is.

\- On top of that, the pipette tip somehow touched the bottom of one of the
deep-well wells and the dispense was impacted; it couldn't push the fluid out
and then it exploded out as pressure built up. No idea how this happened.
