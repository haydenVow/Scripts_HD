Aim/Purpose


Background

Given the initial findings from Mini-tissues experiments 1-5 in the multi-well
mould design, we will now begin trialling a much larger circular mould design.
This design is intended to be more scaleable and to allow the generation of
much larger tissue constructs in a stackable manner (see initial write-up here
and here). Producing tissues at this scale (6cm discs) will hopefully allow us
to produce a complex, layered textured product.

Findings from experiment 5 have shown that tissues form well between 15 and 60
million cells per mL. As such we will trial tissue disc formation at 30 and 60
million cells per mL, to assess the formation, integrity, thickness and
stability of tissues at these two densities.

Aim

To produce large tissue-engineered tissues in a scaleable, parallelised manner

Hypothesis

Large scale tissue formation will be highly dependent on cell density


Methods and Experiment layout


Experiment layout

We will attempt to seed four tissue discs. Each disc will be a single
replicate (condition). Conditions will be as follows:

  1. 30 million cells per mL, 20mL tissue gel
  2. 30 million cells per mL, 25mL tisue gel
  3. 60 million cells per mL, 20mL tissue gel
  4. 60 million cells per mL, 25mL tisue gel
