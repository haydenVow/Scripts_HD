RELATED TO MILESTONE:  KR1

AIM/PURPOSE: To improve throughput, accuracy and repeatability of results
obtained using media feeds and Immunostaining runs. To free up operator time
by running more assays using lab automation

HYPOTHESIS: Biological results obtained using automated workflow are
comparable or better than those obtained using the standard manual process

RESULTS SUMMARY:

  * Daily Feeds: Daily automated media changes resulted in hindered differentiation in comparison to manual media change. This is most likely due to incomplete media removal on the Opentrons, whereas manual operators can execute 100% media exchanges.
  * Immunostaining: 
    * (semi-)automated immunostaining yielded similar images to manually immunostained plates.
    * No occurrence of patchy cell loss was observed in automated immunostained plates as compared to some defects in manually processed plates

CONCLUSIONS:

Daily feed automation is not ready to deploy until biological results
(maturation marker detection) equals the manually processed plates. Further
optimization is required

Automated Immunostaining is ready to deploy, since it outperforms manually
processes plates and frees up significant operator time (approx. 4h total
hands-on time manually for 1x 96wp, 20 min hands-on time for automated
processing = deck setup and reagent prep)

NEXT STEPS:

  * finalize image analysis macro and obtain quantitative data on automated vs manual immunostaining
  * further optimization of auto-IF using PCR plates (low dead volume) and cold blocks for precious and temp.- sensitive reagents (antibodies)
  * light block infrastructure
  * further optimization needed for feeds
