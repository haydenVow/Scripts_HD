### Preparation of reagents  

For Passage: Heat the following to 30C in the water bath

  1. TrypLE:     15 mL in      1   tube
  2.  dPBS (for neutralising):   15  mL
  3.  dPBS (for washing):     15 mL
  4. DMEM + 20% FBS + 1 x PS for pellet resuspension + Seeding):    250 mL

Time that all aliquots were placed in the water bath the warmed to 30C before
use  16:00  

Note: if aliquots were placed in water bath at different time, record the time
stamp for each individual solution.




Passage  

  1. Removed vessel(s) from the incubator   16:15  

  2. Washed the vessel(s) with dPBS (warmed).
  3. Added 10ml tryple to each vessel/well and incubated at 30ËšC.
  4. Start/Finish for TrypLE was   16:17-16:27    

  5. Neutralised each with with   dPBS (equal to volume of tryple) and transferred to   20ml  tube.
  6. Centrifuged at 650 x g for 5 min.
  7. Start/Finish time for centrifugation was   16:31-16:36
  8. Aspirated the supernatant(s).
  9. Resuspended pellet(s) in   5 mL   growth  media
  10.  Aliquoted   20uL  of resuspended cells into a micro centrifuge tube for cell count.
  11. Performed a cell count using the haemocytometer and recorded the cell count data in the Google Doc spreadsheet called 'Cell Count Spreadsheet' (see link below):

SSIBtIylyrBQE5kRX5Z8NtI/edit#gid=0  

    1. Total cell count was : 9,120,000
    2. Re-seeded approximately cells into 7x T175 flasks, giving a seeding density of 7,444
    3.  Incubate at 30C and 5% CO2. 17:30
