Sam and Eva banked the 50/50 WCB. Sam started dispensing cell suspension into
the end vials, while Eva started dispensing into the first vials. When they
reached the vials in the middle, they realised an extra cryovial had been
labelled. This is the reason why cryovial 15075 does not exist.

Process
  
  
  1. Performed a cell count and determine the total number of live cells present in the culture intended for cryopreservation.

    1. Took 2 x 1 mL samples per flask for count using 5 mL serelogical pipettes 

  2. Calculate the number of vials that are required to be frozen.

    1. Banking 20 x vials @ 7.5M cells per vial in 1 mL of freeze medium (7.5M cells/mL) for R&D

      1. Total # cells = 150M

      2. Total # vials = 20 x cryovials 

    2. Seeding 2 x E250 flasks with 15M cells each per flask

      1. Total # cells = 30M

      2. Total # flasks = 2 x E250s

    3. Banking remaining cells @ 15M cells per vial in 2 mL of freeze medium (7.5M cells/mL) for MFG  
  

      1. Total # cells = 3,801,000,000 (total cell count minus cells taken for R&D WCB and continuous culture)
        1. Too many for banking (not enough Mr Frostys). 3,210,000,000 cells will be banked and the rest will passaged and given to MFG for ST18
      2. Total # vials = 214 x 2 mL cryovials at 7.5Mcells/mL --> 15Mcells/vial
  3. Determine the volume of cell suspension from the culture required for centrifugation.

    1. For MFG and R&D WCB
      1. 3,360,000,000 cells total = 3.535 L cell suspension
  4. Fill the required number of Mr Frosty freezing container (18 vials per container) with the necessary volume of isopropanol.

  5. Prepare room temperature cell resuspension media (CRM) and cell freezing medium (CFM). Each vial is required to be filled with 50% CRM and 50% CFM, i.e., for 10 vials 5 mL of CRM and 5 mL of CFM is required. See below:

    * CRM: Complete 1:1 RPMI1640:CHO-in-1 Nuvonis suspension growth medium
    * CFM: CRM with 15% DMSO (250 mL: 212.5mL 50/50, 37.5mL DMSO)  
  
\- Media requirements:

      * For R&D WCB:
        * Need 20 mL total + error (10 mL CRM + 10 mL CFM)
      * For MFG WCB:
        * Need 428 mL total + error (214 mL CRM + 214 mL CFM)
  6. For continuous culture

    1. Transfer 30M cells- 12 mL from 12744 and 16 mL from 12743- to 2 x E250 flasks (15M to each)

    2. Top up each E250 flask with fresh growth medium to a final density of ~200K per mL (~70 mL total media per flask)

      1. 112mL total 50/50: 58mL for 12744 and 54mL for 12743

  7. For banking (can do both WCBs together and simply add 1 mL of cell to R&D cryovials and 2 mL of cells to MFG cryovials)

    1. Transfer the required volume of cell suspension from the culture vessel into an appropriate vessel for centrifugation (i.e. 250 mL falcon tube).

    2. Centrifuge the cells at 310 x g for 10 minutes at 22°C in a swing out rotor.

    3. Aspirate the supernatant.

    4. Re-suspend the cell pellet in the total volume of CRM prepared earlier. (15M cells/mL) 

    5. Dilute the cell suspension by adding the total volume of CFM in the same vessel. (7.5M cells/mL) 

    6. Homogenise the cells suspension by gently pipetting.

    7. Aliquot the total volume of cell suspension into cryovials (1 mL per vial for R&D, 2 mL per vial for MFG).

    8. Transfer the cryovials into the Mr Frosty freezing container.

    9. Place freezing container at -80°C for 16-24 hours.

    10. The day after freezing, transfer the vials from the freezing containers to ≤-150°C (liquid nitrogen dewars) for long term storage.


Notes

  * Added GFs as well as L-glutamine and glucose to the CRM and CFM (topped up the glucose levels to 6g/L and the L-glutamine to 4mM).
