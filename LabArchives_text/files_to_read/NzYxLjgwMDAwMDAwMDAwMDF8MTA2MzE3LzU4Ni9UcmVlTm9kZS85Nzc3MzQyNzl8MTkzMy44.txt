Some media components are supporting maturation (NAD+), but literature is not
always clear on numbers and mechanisms. However, 5mM Creatine has been shown
to promote the fusion of myoblasts assessed by an increased number of nuclei
incorporated within myotubes by 40%. Expression of myosin heavy chain type II
also increased by 1300%, troponin T by 65% and titin by 40%.

The recommendation is to try the following:

  * add 5 mM Creatine to differentiation media in a dish vs non-creatine control and assess maturation levels in planar culture using ELISA or IHC staining.
  * If successful, incorporate into a reactor run and use in combination with scaffolds




MEDIA COMPONENTS promoting maturation (please insert main finding and
reference):

1. Creatine supplementation:When creatine supplementation is combined with heavy resistance training, muscle insulin like growth factor (IGF-1) concentration has been shown to increase.  https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3407788/ 

2. NAD+ supplementation: There is no evidence that primary (embryonic) myogenesis requires modulation of NAD+ levels in vivo. There is, however, data indicating that secondary (fetal) myogenesis may integrate nutrient sensing with NAD+ levels and SIRT1 activity to mediate muscle growth in vivo.

4\. Creatine supplementation: 5mM Creatine also promoted the fusion of
myoblasts assessed by an increased number of nuclei incorporated within
myotubes (+40%, P &lt; 0.001). Expression of myosin heavy chain type II
(+1,300%, P &lt; 0.001), troponin T (+65%, P &lt; 0.01), and titin (+40%, P
&lt; 0.05) was enhanced by creatine

5\. Review article pdf full link: Summary HGF, FGF2, TGF-, and PDGF are
essential during early phases of muscle regeneration, they are known to
inhibit subsequent differentiation into mature muscle. This highlights the
importance of the highly regulated and temporal expression of growth factors
throughout skeletal muscle regeneration. Other growth factors, including
insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) and 2 (IGF-2), stimulate both
proliferation and differentiation of SCs. Myofiber maturation is also highly
dependent on revascularization of the tissue and the generation of
neuromuscular junctions.
