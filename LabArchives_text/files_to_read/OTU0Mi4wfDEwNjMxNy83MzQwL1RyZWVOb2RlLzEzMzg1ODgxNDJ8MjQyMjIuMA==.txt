Prepare materials for passage and seed:

1\. Aliquotted the required volume of each reagent in the table above. Growth
media (for seeding):   60 mL per specimen jar x2 and added growth factors  
  
2\. Added media to water bath and incubated at 37degC

Time that aliquot was placed in the incubator to warm before use:
12:15-15:15  

3\. Added media to shake flask and incubated at 37degC in incubator to
equilibrate media (as per SOP, attached).

Time that aliquot was placed in the incubator to warm before use:   16:00  

  




Cell Count:

  

1\. Harvested 100ul per flask for cell count

2\. Diluted 1:2 with trypan blue ~~  
~~

3\. Recorded cell counts inspreadsheet
