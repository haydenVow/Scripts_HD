Background

We recently derived a number of cell lines via the isolation and culture of
cells from quail embryonic tissue (Japanese and Bob-white Quail species) in
different culture medias. See lab books here, https://au-

BOBBO was derived from the Bob-White Quail, and cultured in serum free/ACF
OptiPRO + 4mM Glutamax, was a particularly prolific, and showed initial
promise in suspension adaption experiments. See lab books here,  
Quail suspension adaptation EXP1:  
Quail suspension adaptation EXP2 :  
Quail suspension adaptation EXP3 :  
A working cell bank of these cells will therefore be generated so that they
can continue to be used for future experiments.
