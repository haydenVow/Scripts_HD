Aim / Goal


To increase speed of cell pelleting during centrifugation through flocculation
of cell suspension.


Background and Hypothesis


Flocculation is the aggregation of the cells into larger aggregates to assist
in the seperation of the cell mass from the its residing media.

Although there exists a wide variety of flocculants used in different
industries, we are limited to those that are food safe, edible and animal
cruelty free. Following the research of Riske et al. 2006 who used a complex
of chitosan and alginate to clarify a cell suspension from the produced
antibodies, we will be exploring a variety of chitosan forms and a complex of
chitosan and alginate to try and replicate the results seen in Riske et al.
2006.


Protocol


  

  1. Create 1% chitosan stock solution in a 1% acetic acid and stir for several hours.
  2. Add chitosan stock solution to cell suspension to a final concentration of 0.05% v/v.
  3. Stir for 30 mins and allow to settle for up to 100 mins OR centrifuge for 2.5, 5 or 7.5 mins.
  4. Determine turbidity of supernatant through spectroscopy.

  

ADDITIONAL EXPERIMENT

1\. Repeat previous experiment with chitosan complexed with alginate solution
at 0.5% to 1% w/v.
