Prepare Cytodex 1 microcarriers




Process: [Nathan, Avani]

Hydrate and sterilize microcarriers

  1. 5g of Dry Cytodex microcarriers were added to a suitably siliconized (non-stick) glass bottle in the main lab.
  2.   250 mL  of PBS (free of Ca2+, Mg2+) was added (50-100 mL/g Cytodex) and the microcarriers allowed to swell for at least 3 h at room temperature (or less at 37 deg C) with occasional gentle agitation occasionally by hand [10:30-1:30pm] 
  3. 50% of the supernatant was removed and the microcarriers were washed once with gentle agitation for a few minutes in fresh PBS (free of Ca2+, Mg2+) (30-50 mL/g Cytodex). 
  4. 50% of the PBS was discarded and replaced with fresh PBS (free of Ca2+, Mg2+) (30-50 mL/g Cytodex) (back to 250mL) and the microcarriers were sterilized by autoclaving in the main lab autoclave at 121 deg C for 30 minutes. [2:15pm]
  5. Once the autoclave chamber cooled to approximately 70 deg C, the sterilized suspension was transferred to a BSC to cool completely in the main lab.

[April 9, 8:45] Equilibrate microcarriers in culture medium before use.

Culture media: DMEM/F12 + 20% FBS + 1xP/S  

  1. Transferred the stock microcarrier suspension to the library lab.  
  2. Prior to use, 6.75mL of 20g/L sterilized microcarriers were aliquoted into an E125 flasks inside the BSC.
  3. The microcarriers were rinsed with warm culture medium (15.75mL) (this rinse reduces dilution of the culture medium by PBS trapped between and within the microcarriers, which is particularly important when using small culture volumes or cells with low plating efficiencies).
  4. The microcarriers were then allowed to settle and 16mL of supernatant was removed.
  5. Microcarriers were resuspended up to 30mL in culture media.
  6. The culture vessel was transferred to the incubator for at least 1 hour or overnight so that the microcarriers and culture medium could equilibrate. [8:50]
  7. Stock microcarrier container lid was tightened and the container stored at 4 deg C in the reagents fridge (#75) in the main lab.
