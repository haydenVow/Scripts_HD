  1. Took samples to the PCR machine and set the settings to (melting temp for primers used was 61 degress C).  

  2. To visualize PCR products, made up a 1 % agarose gel in 0.5X TBE buffer (1 tablet + 50mL of 0.5X TBE). 
    1. The following tutorial was followed for setting up the gel electrophoresis station on the BentoLab https://bento.bio/protocol/biotechnology-101/introduction-to-gel-electrophoresis/
  3. Ran the PCR products on the gel using 2uL of loading dye mixed with 5uL of PCR product. Loading order listed below
