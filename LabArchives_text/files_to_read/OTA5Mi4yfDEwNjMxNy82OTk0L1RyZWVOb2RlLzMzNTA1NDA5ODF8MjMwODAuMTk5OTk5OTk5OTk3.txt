### Process:

  1. Took image of vessel with microscope on phase setting.
  2. Aliquotted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath for a minimum of 20 minutes prior to use
  3. Removed vessel(s) from the incubator
  4. Washed the vessel(s) with dPBS (warmed).
  5. Added    10    mL tryple to each vessel/well and incubated at 37ËšC for 8min (OPTI) 15min (KSR), checking every few min until >90% of cells were detatched.
  6. Neutralised with    10      dPBS and combined cell suspension into      50ml   tubes.
  7. Centrifuged at 500 x g for 5 min.
  8. Aspirated the supernatant(s).
  9. Resuspended pellet(s) in      5 mL  respective growth medias 
  10. Took 30ul sample from each line, and performed cell count

KSR: 1.88M  
OptiPRO: 2.47M

  11. Centrifuged at 650 x g for 5 min, and resuspended in 2ml (KSR cells) or 3ml (OptiPro cells) cryostor   

  12. Cell suspensions transferred to cryovials, 1mL/1M cells/vial
  13. Cryovials transferred to pre-chilled Mr. Frosty, and placed in -80 freezer.
