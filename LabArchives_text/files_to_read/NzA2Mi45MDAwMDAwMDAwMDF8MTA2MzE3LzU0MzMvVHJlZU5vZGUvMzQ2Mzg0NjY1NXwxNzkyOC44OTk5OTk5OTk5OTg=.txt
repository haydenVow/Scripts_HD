Aim/Purpose


To adapt F_DOLLY12 cells to suspension using P53i and HDACs


Hypothesis


We hypothesise that HDACs and/or P53i will enable F_DOLLY12 cells to adapt to
suspension


Technical Gap


We have so far been unable to successfully adapt cells to suspension culture.
We have tested HDAC1 and HDAC2 in a past experiment (see here), however those
cultures did not produce any suspension adapted cells. We hypothesise that
that was due to the medium not being supplemented with key growth factors,
such as IGF-1-LR3, b-FGF, and PDGF-BB. The cultures were also grown in 6-well
plates, and thus far we have only seen promising adaptation results in E-125
flasks. While we have tested a P53-inhibitor in adherent cultures (see here),
it has not yet been trialed in suspension cultures.


Method/Procedure


Things to note

  * Cells will be harvested when the flasks reach ~100% confluence, hence being unable to assign a specific day for seeding
  * The base/control medium for this experiment is CD CHO + 10% KSR + 1:100 ACA + 1:100 glutamax + 1xP/S + 6G supplement  
    * The medium can be prepared ahead of time without the 10% KSR and 6G supplement. When preparing the medium for the experiment, leave 10% of volume free for KSR addition. No need to leave room for the 6G supplement as it only makes up ~600 uL per 100 mL of medium. 
    * The 10% KSR and 6G supplement (100 ng/mL FGF/IGF, 10 ng/mL PDGF, lipid supplement 1:1000, RGD 100 ng/mL, YIGSR 100 ng/mL) will be added on the day of feeding directly to media aliquots

Experimental Plan  

  1. D0: Thaw 110M F_DOLLY12 cells into 6 x 4CFs in DMEM/F12+10%FBS+1xP/S. Note: only 2 of the 4CFs will be used for this experiment - the remaining 4 will seed a further 2 suspension experiments
  2. D3: Perform 50% feed with DMEM/F12 + 10% FBS + 1xP/S
  3. D6: Perform 50% feed with CD CHO + 10% KSR + 1xP/S 
  4. D~8: (1 day prior to harvesting) Prepare experimental media (need 2940 mL total for seeding and feeds - round up to 3000 mL) 
    1. Prepare base medium without KSR or 6G supplement: 2,700 mL of CD CHO + 1:100 ACA + 1:100 Glutamax + 1xP/S.  
      * Calculations
        * For seeding: 20 mL x 21 flasks = 420 mL 
        * For feeds: (75% feeds, 2 x per week for 30 days = 8 feeds) 15 mL x 21 flasks x 8 = 2520 mL  
  

    2. Prepare HDAC aliquots
      1. Remove HDAC1 and HDAC2 vials from -80'C freezer 
      2. Allow to thaw at RT 
      3. Centrifuge vials and transfer to BSC 
      4. Make up aliquots of following volumes:
        1. HDAC1: 2.42 uL
        2. HDAC2: 11.58 uL 
      5. Place back in -80'C freezer  

  5. D~9: (when ~100% confluent) Prepare medium and seed 21 x E-125 flasks with F_DOLLY12 cells  
    1. Prepare media. Note: see schematic diagrams at bottom of step 5 for visual aid in media prep and seeding setup   

  

      * Aliquot: 378 mL of base medium
      * Add 6G supplement ingredients and KSR to 378 mL aliquot as described in table below (this will result in ~420 mL aliquot)   
  

      * KSR + 6G supplement

    2. Add growth media in triplicates to E-125s and seed each flask with ~10M cells (see diagram below) 
    3. Take 1 x 100 uL sample from each E-125 and move into separate wells of 1 x 96WP. Stain with Hoechst ReadyFlow and capture image using Zaber microscope to procure cell counts .  
    4. Place E-125s on shaker platforms in incubator (37'C, 5%CO2) and set to shake at 120 rpm  

  6. D~14: Perform 75% feed on E-flasks every Tuesday and Friday for minimum 30 days (use linked spreadsheet to calculate volumes to add for 75% feeds)

    1. At every feed, stain, dilute and image samples from all E-flasks and zaber image for FIJI cell count analysis   

    2. At every feed, rinse E-flasks with sterile dPBS while cultures are centrifuging

    3. On Day 28 feed, perform haemocytometer counts alongside staining and imaging

  7. Collate and graph all cell counts and perform statistical analysis
