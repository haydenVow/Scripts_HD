Process:

  1. Aliquoted growth media as follows:
    * 25 mL of CDCHO media in 50 mL tubes
    * Added FGF-B, PDGF-BB and IGF-1 (100 ng/mL) to aliquot
      * Placed in water bath   15:06  

  

  1. Collected E125s from shaker, wiped with ethanol-sprayed Rediwipe, and brought into BSC 15:53
  2. Using a 25 mL serelogical pipette, gently pipette-mixed culture for 1 minute to break up cell clumps
  3. Pipette suspension though 70 um cell strainer into 1 x 50 mL tubes. Kept E125 vessels in BSC, as culture will be returned to this vessel after feed. 
  4. Centrifuged 50 mL tubes at 300 x g for 5 min.    15:58- 16:03  

  5. Aspirated  100% (25 mL) of supernatant, taking extra care to not disrupt or aspirate pellet 
  6. Resuspended in 200 uL of medium
  7. Took 1 x 10 uL sample for haemocytometer cell count  
Cell count: 1,115,200

  8. Added  25 mL of fresh, warmed growth media to each 50 mL tube
  9. Gently pipette-mixed cultures using serelogical, before moving cell suspension back to E125s
  10. Returned E125 to incubator.   16:30
