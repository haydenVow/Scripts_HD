  1. Obtained cell suspension containing M cells from 75/25 RPMI/CHO flask ID _____.
  2. Obtained cell suspension containing M cells from 50/50 RPMI/CHO flask ID 12,353 and 8M cells from 50/50 RPMI/CHO flask ID 12,366
  3. Aliquoted 240 mL of both 50/50 and 75/25 RPMI/CHO media and added 240 uL of IGF-1L3 and 48 uL of EGF to each aliquot.
  4. For 50/50 cultures: Dispensed ___ mL of cell suspension containing a total of 3M cells in 1 x 50mL tube, _____ mL of cell suspension containing a total of 6M cells in 1 x 50mL tube, ______ mL of cell suspension containing a total of 12M cells in 1 x 50mL tube, and _____ mL of cell suspension containing a total of 24M cells in 1 x 50mL tube.
  5. For 75/25 cultures: Dispensed ___ mL of cell suspension containing a total of 3M cells in 1 x 50mL tube, _____ mL of cell suspension containing a total of 6M cells in 1 x 50mL tube, ______ mL of cell suspension containing a total of 12M cells in 1 x 50mL tube, and _____ mL of cell suspension containing a total of 24M cells in 1 x 50mL tube.
  6. Centrifuged the tubes @ 500 xg for 5 minutes.
  7. After centrifugation, aspirated the supernatant and re-suspended cell pellet in 20 mL of respective medium. Then re-seeded cell suspension into every flask.
  8. Replaced E125 in incubator at 37'C, 5% CO2, 120 RPM
