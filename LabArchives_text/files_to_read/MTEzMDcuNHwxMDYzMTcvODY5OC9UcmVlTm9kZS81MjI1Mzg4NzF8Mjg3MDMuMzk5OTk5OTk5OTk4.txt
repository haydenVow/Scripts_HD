Aim / Goal


To create "Pork Bun Gel".


Protocol


Pork Bun Gel Creation

  1. Weigh out all biomaterial powders (see below) and combine together into a homogenous powder.
    1. 2% (w/v) Low viscosity alginate
    2. 2% (w/v)  Metho cellulose (Sigma Aldrich Brand)
    3. 1% (w/v) Xanthan Gum
    4. 1% (w/v) Glucomannan
  2. Hydrate various biomaterials to required volume in PBS. Stir with a spatula until mostly dissolved. If clumps form, try pushing against the side of the jar.
  3. Leave for 1hr in room temperature
  4. Stir to ensure a homogenous biogel, incorporate air in to form bubbles
  5. Autoclave for 30 mins at 121C on liquid setting. Or pressure cook at similar settings with water in pan.
  6. Refrigerate remaining gel overnight at 4C.

Observations/Notes


During creation the medium MW gel created a paler lumpier consistency compared
to the low MW gel, this paler colour transfered to the post autoclave step.
Post autoclave, both gels formed pucks that had to be broken up and mushed to
form a gel like consistency again. These were transferred to sterile wide
mouthed containers.


Conclusion


Gels followed expectations during creation and autoclaving.
