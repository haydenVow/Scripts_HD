Observations  
  
9411-WALLE06-Bennets Wallaby P0-1of1  
https://mia-capture.vow.tools/#/session/rec0Zaj3lV03FZipR/images  
Fairly sparely populated except for one dense are of cells with a fibroblastic
morphology.  
  
9412-WALLE07-Bennets Wallaby P0-1of1  
https://mia-capture.vow.tools/#/session/recD9g25kDiyPOeF9/images  
A lot of the adhered cells have a morphology more characteristic of muscle
cells that fibroblasts with long protrusions.  
  
9413-WALLE08-Bennets Wallaby P0-1of1  
https://mia-capture.vow.tools/#/session/recCVxmehAA2KsI1B/images  
Only a handful of adhered cells were seen in the entire well

Cultures appearing much as they did at last observation yesterday. Several
