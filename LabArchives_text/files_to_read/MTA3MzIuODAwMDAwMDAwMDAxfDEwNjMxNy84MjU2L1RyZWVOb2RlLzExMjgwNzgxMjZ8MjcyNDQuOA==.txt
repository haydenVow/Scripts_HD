  3. Aliquotted;  
(1) 20mL CHO Part A + Nuvonis and, added 20uL of IGF and 4uL of EGF.  
(2) 40mL Hycell + Nuvonis and, added 40uL of IGF and 8uL of EGF.

  4. Aliquoted the following mL of cell suspension into 3 x 50 mL tubes:

  5. Centrifuged the tubes @ 500 xg for 5 minutes.
  6. After centrifugation, aspirated the supernatant and resuspended cell pellet in 20 mL of medium.
  7. Seeded E-125 with cell suspension.
  8. Replaced E125 in incubator at 37'C, 5% CO2, 120 RPM
