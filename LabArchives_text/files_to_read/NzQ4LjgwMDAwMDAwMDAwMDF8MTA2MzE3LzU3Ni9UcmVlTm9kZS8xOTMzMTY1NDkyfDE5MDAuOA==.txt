RELATED TO MILESTONE:  Milestone 1A: Determine baseline ACF adhesion,
proliferation and harvest performance on cytodex microcarriers, and baseline
ACF adhesion to zein

AIM/PURPOSE: To determine the baseline level of adhesion and proliferation of
cells grown in our top 3 ACF media formulations (E89C, E810C, E811B) on
Cytodex microcarriers.

HYPOTHESIS: Cells grown in ACF media may not adhere to microcarriers as well
as cells grown in serum containing media. Cells in some ACF formulations may
adhere and proliferate better than others. We may be able to pick our best ACF
formulation that works with Cytodex microcarriers from this comparison.

RESULTS SUMMARY:

  

CONCLUSIONS: Cells grown in ACF formulations E89C, E810C, and E811B can adhere
to Cytodex microcarriers for up to 4 days in suspension. No growth was
observed during the 4 days of attempted proliferation in suspension for the
serum control or for any of the ACF media conditions.  

Note: The TGFb used in this experiment was not reconstituted according to the
manufacturer's instructions which may have impacted results.

NEXT STEPS: Follow up experiments (See EPIC16804) will focus on:  
1\. conducting the experiment for longer than 4 days and performing
experiments in 125mL shake flasks in an attempt to promote proliferation

2\. harvesting of cells grown in ACF media on Cytodex microcarriers

3\.  long term culture
