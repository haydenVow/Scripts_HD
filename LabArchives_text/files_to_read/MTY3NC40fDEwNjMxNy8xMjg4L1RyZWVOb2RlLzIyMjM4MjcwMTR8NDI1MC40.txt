The Kamoer X2S peristaltic pump is one used for aquariums and was perchased
from Aquaristic in Alexandria for $600.

Aquatic Supplies Australia demonstrates the benefits and specs of this system:

  

Highlights

  * Transfer pumps with stepper motors for longer life and more accurate operation
  * Anti-overflow sensor will trigger an alarm and stop the pump if the water reaches the sensor
  * Less water-changing connection lines, simple use
  * Support sedation of additional evaporative water
  * Pharmed BPT imported pump tube with standard, long life, heat, acid and alkali resistance, ozone and UV rays, anti-aging and oxidation
  * Up to 12 water change plans can be set up in a day to support 1-99 days of cycle water change
  * Support for flow calibration
  * Includes real-time clock, runs automatically according to setting parameters, and does not lose power-down parameters
  * Support for iOS and Android devices to control titration pumps via WIFI, and app upgrade titration pump firmware
  * Pump maximum distance 1.5m. 

Specs:

  * Dimensions: 220 x 160 x 95mm
  * Pump Head Rotor: 3 Rotors KCm
  * Pump Head Flow: >300ml/min
  * Temperature: 0-70C
  * Net Weight: 1.2kg
  * Weight: 2115g
  * Humidity: 10-90%
  * Number of water changes: 12 times/day - 1 times/99 days

However reviews online have shown that it can pump further than 1.5 m
distance.

  

The Pharmed BPT pump tube is attached to a plastic connector. It is unknown
how this connector will cope with autoclaving. Max temperature of the tubing
itself is 275 degrees C. The Pharmed tubing measures 104 mm long.

Shenchen tubing is what is typically used in house. The thick walled Shenchen
silicone tubing #15 was found to not be compatible with peristalic pumps,
however it can still be used for transporting liquid. Shenchen silicone tubing
#17 has a thinner wall and was found to be more compatible with peristaltic
pumps.

thicknesses. A) #17 B) #15.

  

Some of the assorted Luer lock hose barb components were found to be useful in
locking the #17 tubing into the Kamoer pump heads (figure 3).

The pump has two heads which can be controlled to pump at the same time or at
different times. This can be done at set time points or continuously. A video
of the pump set up in a single loop with a bioreactor and a media reservoir is
shown below:
