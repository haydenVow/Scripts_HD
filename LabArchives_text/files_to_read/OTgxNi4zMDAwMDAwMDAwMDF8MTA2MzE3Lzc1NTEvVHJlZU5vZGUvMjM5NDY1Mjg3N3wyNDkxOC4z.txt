### Process:

1\. Took image of vessel with microscope on phase setting.

3\. Aliquotted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then
placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath for a minimum of 20 minutes
prior to use:

  1. TrypLE:     5    mL in     1 x 15mL    tubes
  2.  dPBS (for neutralising):     5    mL
  3.  dPBS (for washing):     5    mL
  4. Growth media (for pellet resuspension):     1    mL
  5. Growth media (for seeding):     30 + 30    mL 

Time that all aliquots were placed in the water bath the warm before use
11:10   a/pm

Note: if aliquots were placed in water bath at different time, record the time
stamp for each individual solution.




4\. Removed vessel(s) from the incubator     11:25   a/pm

5\. Washed the vessel(s) with dPBS (warmed).

6\. Added    5    mL tryple to each vessel/well and incubated at 30˚C.  

  1. Start/Finish for TrypLE was     11:34 - 11;58  a/pm 

7\. Neutralised with     5     dPBS with waterfall technique (5 x) and
combined cell suspension into a     15mL    tube.

8\. Centrifuged at 650 x g for 5 min.

  1. Start/Finish time for centrifugation was     12:02 - 12:07   a/pm 




9\. Aspirated the supernatant(s).

10\. Resuspended pellet(s) in     1    mL     RPMI 1640 Growth Media     media
12:20   a/pm

11\. Aliquoted     20uL     of resuspended cells into a microcentrifuge tube
for cell count.

12\. Performed a cell count using the haemocytometer and recorded the cell
count data in the Google Doc spreadsheet: Cell Count Spreadsheet or cell count
widget below




13\. Transferred       500 + 500    µl of cell suspension to the pre-warmed
27 + 27     mL Growth media:      12:40    a/pm

14\. Transferred cell suspensions into the    2 x T175      vessel.

16\. Transferred vessel(s) to incubate at 12:46pm:  

  * [X]  30ºC, 5% CO2 (reptile cells)
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (avian cells)

Version Change Log

NameChange Details  
V1 (original)N/A  
V2Changed all sentences to past tense to better reflect a hand-written lab
book entry.  
Various formatting changes.  
Addition of more detail to step 2, removal of step 3. Replaced volume
requirements table with updated volumes @Sep 22, 2020  
Updated temperature selection for mammalian/aviary cells @Sep 23, 2020  
V3Included a section for 'vessel type' in passage ID table Replace
'flask/plate' with 'vessel' throughout lab book Include at step 1 to take
image of vessel on the microscope  
Mentioned that dPBS for washing should be warm - step 3(2) and 5.  
Added timepoint at step 4 for when vessel is removed from incubator  
Include at step 11 to aliquot cell resuspension into microcentrifuge tube  
Included at step 10 and 13 time point for when cell pellet is resuspended and
when resuspended cells is moved into growth media.  
Included p38i in table of regent used  
Combined two dPBS entries in 'Media/reagents' table Added 'cell density per
vessel'
