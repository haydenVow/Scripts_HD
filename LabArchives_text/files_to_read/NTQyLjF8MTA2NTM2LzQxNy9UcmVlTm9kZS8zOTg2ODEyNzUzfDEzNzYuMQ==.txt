(1) TGFb Seeded (ONLY, 18 days)  
Images are taken from flasks 7829, 7831, 7834, and 7830. One image from any of
these flasks was chosen to represent each time point(2) TGFb Seeded (11 days)
and then VitC treated (7 days)  
Images are taken from flasks 7832, 7833, and 7835. One image from any of these
flasks was chosen to represent  
each time point

Peeling Observations:

  * Group 2 (4xT175) First signs of peeling occurred at D17 (6 days after VitC treatment)
  * Harvested on D18 (7 days after VitC treatment)

  * Group 1 (3xT175) TGFb controls showed no signs of peeling
  * Harvested on D18 still showing no signs of peeling
