Proliferation Assay Results


See IH016 for proliferation first attempt (Gibco, IH012, IH013, IH015, IH016)

This attempt was unsuccessful so was not properly analysed but the data for
this attempt can still be observed.

See IH017 for proliferation assay data and results

The first attempt wasn't successful so another proliferation assay was
performed when some new batches were made (IH017 and IH018)
