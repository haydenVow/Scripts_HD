Key Result(s)


Completed by: Bonnie Tangey




As we did not have the incubator space to run both expansions in parallel, and
CHOMP09 WCB1 reached our target numbers, this culture was terminated after 3
weeks in which it underwent 2 passages.  The average doubling time was 3.28
days, which is relatively slow however this is not surprising given we have
seen in the past that CHOMP cells take time to recover from a thaw.

Future Direction(s)


This WCB was not carried through to banking due to sufficient cells being
obtained from CHOMP09 WCB1. When this WCB is exhausted however, another WCB
may need to be generated.
