## 3\. Safety

The preparation of LAA2P aliquots is to be performed in a Biological Safety
Cabinet. General lab PPE is required, including face mask, hair net, gloves,
and lab coat.

## 5\. Consumables/Reagents Required

  1. Milli-Q water
  2. LAA2P stock powder
  3. Weigh boat 
  4. 2 x Falcon tubes
  5. 1 x Syringe filter unit
  6. Sterile microtubes 




## 8\. Method/Procedure (suitable for Sigma CAS# 1713265-25-8)

Note: Please perform this procedure with the BSC light turned off. Growth
factors are often sensitive to light exposure.  

  1. Calculate the volume of Milli-Q water required to create a 100 mg/mL stock solution.
  2. Using a serological pipette, transfer the required amount of Milli-Q water into a sterile falcon tube in the Biological Safety Cabinet (BSC).  
  3. Retrieve stock powder from storage location (LAA2P stock is kept at ambient temperature).
  4. Using a weigh boat, weigh out desired amount of LAA2P (only necessary if not reconstituting the entire bottle) 
  5. Using a micropipette, transfer Milli-Q from the falcon tube to the weigh boat/stock bottle to reconstitute the powder to a concentration of 1.0 mg/mL. Pipette mix thoroughly and smoothly to dissolve the stock powder, taking care not to spill any of the solution. 
  6. Transfer the entire solution back to the falcon tube of Milli-Q water. Repeat steps 5 - 6 twice more (with larger volumes of MilliQ if necessary) to ensure that the entire amount of powder is dissolved in the Milli-Q water. 
  7. Check the weigh boat/stock bottle to ensure that there is no powder left. If any powder remains, repeat steps 5 - 6 until the vial is clean.
  8. Using a serological pipette, carefully mix the solution to ensure a homogenous mix (do not vortex!). 
    * Note: this powder can take a long time to dissolve, but do not place this solution in the water bath to speed up process! This will result in the solution forming a lipid-like solid. Instead, wrap the tube and agitate for a period of time (keeping protected from light either in BSC or wrapped in foil) until powder has dissolved. 
  9. Pour or pipette solution into a syringe filter unit and filter into a new sterile falcon tube.
  10. Transfer the solution into sterile microtubes. Remember to add at least 5 uL to your desired aliquot volume to account for loss of liquid from pipetting. 
  11. Enter details in Stockyard V2 under "Create Mix".
  12. Place aliquots into an appropriately sized container (e.g. cryobox, 500 mL sterile pot) and stick Stockyard label on the container. Add a note of the volume per aliquot for future users. 
  13. Store in - 20 degrees C freezer.
