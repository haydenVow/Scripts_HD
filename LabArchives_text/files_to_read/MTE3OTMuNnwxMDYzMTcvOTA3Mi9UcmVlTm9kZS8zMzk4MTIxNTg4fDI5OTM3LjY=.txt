Process:

Took samples

  1. Unscrewed the "BENCHMARK" sample tube cover.
  2. Sprayed down the tube end with 70% ethanol.
  3. Connecedt a 5 mL sterile syringe.
  4. Withdrew slightly more than 3 mL (to purge the line).
  5. Discarded the 5 mL syringe.
  6. Connected a fresh sterile syringe and withdrew 3.5 - 4.0 mL of sample.
  7. Disconnected sample syringe and transferred 1 mL of sample each to 3 x 1.5 mL Eppendorf tubes for subsequent analysis.
  8. Sprayed sample tube end and cap with 70% ethanol, re-attached cap.
