RELATED TO MILESTONE:  Milestone 1: Expand at least one MuSC clone, which is
capable of differentiation, to WCB2 using microcarrier culture

AIM/PURPOSE: To quantify the variance of different cell counting methods in
microcarrier culture. To use this information to choose the best and/or inform
improvement of cell counting methods.

HYPOTHESIS: That different cell counting methods will give different means and
coefficients of variance over multiple counts. That at least two methods will
give similar means and small (<10%) coefficients of variance that enable their
routine use in microcarrier culture analysis.

RESULTS SUMMARY: This should only be completed if the data can be visualised
with a single graph/image, otherwise simply state "See Report".

CONCLUSIONS: What were the overall findings? This should be a concise summary
and not duplicate the information in the results/report. For example "We found
that Bovine MuSCs could only achieve a cell density 50% of that observed with
planar culture without undergoing precocious differentiation. These results
mean that we are currently limited to X cells/ml in suspension culture until
we find a way to inhibit precocious differentiation"

NEXT STEPS: This should be a dot point list of any immediate outcomes, changes
to SOPs, as well as providing a direct link to any new experiments arising
from these findings. Importantly, this section should also include any
potential DEPLOYMENTS to the production team
