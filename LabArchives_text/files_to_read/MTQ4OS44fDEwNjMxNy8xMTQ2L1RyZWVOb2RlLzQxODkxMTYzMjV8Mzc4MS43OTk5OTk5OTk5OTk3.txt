Imaging with Zabar was not successful in this experiment. This was due to a)
initial images at day 1 with Hoechst stain was over exposed, and day 7 images
with Hoechst stain showed no cells adhered. As a result, plates were fixed,
DAPI, primary and secondary stained the following two days. Results showed
that there were cells adhered to all scaffolds, indicating that the hoechst
stain was unable to produce signals.

Observation of images at day 8 (fixed, DAPI, MyoG, MF20):

Upon imaging under the axio, no evidence of MyoG nor MF20 was seen. It is
likely that there are not enough cells for differentiation to take place or
that it is too early for differentiation to occur. Therefore only DAPI images
were taken. Below are DAPI images of scaffolds with the most confluency in
each condition.
