On day one there are various activities. Please follow in the order specified
below:

  1. Live Hoechst staining - scaffolds will need to be moved from original seeded plate onto a 24wp or 96wp for imaging with the zaber 
  2. Prep new plate with media - whilst waiting for Hoechst stain, prepare 24wp or 48wp (with cup and tray inserts) by adding media directly into the wells and placing plate into the incubator to warm. Make sure to either print new ID or transfer old ID onto plates. 
  3. Zaber - after hoechst stain is complete, zaber image plates 
  4. After zaber images is complete, carefully transfer the scaffolds into the new plates containing warm media 
  5. Meanwhile, during any wait time, perform 'calculating seeding density' \- if applicable
