### Process:

Below is information of the passage process. Refer to this when performing the
passage, however input data and timestamps into the widget.

1\. Took image of vessel with microscope on phase setting.

2\. Gelatin coated  vessel with sterile filtered 0.1% gelatin solution and
then incubated all coated flasks at 37˚C.

3\. Aliquotted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then
placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath for a minimum of 20 minutes
prior to use:

  1. TrypLE:  
  2.  dPBS (for washing 
  3. dPBS (for neutralising)
  4. Growth media (for pellet resuspension)
  5. Growth media (for seeding)

Note: if aliquots were placed in water bath at different time, record the time
stamp for each individual solution.

4\. Removed vessel(s) from the incubator

5\. Washed the vessel(s) with dPBS (warmed).

6\. Added  tryple to each vessel/well and incubated at 37˚C for 10 minutes.
Check flask under the microscope to see if cells have detached or need more
time in tryple.

7\. Neutralised with  dPBS and combined cell suspension into a tube.

8\. Centrifuged at 650 x g for 5 min.

9\. Aspirated the supernatant(s).

10\. Resuspended pellet(s) in media

11\. Aliquoted resuspended cells into a microcentrifuge tube for cell count.

12\. Performed a cell count using the haemocytometer and recorded the cell
count data in the Google Doc spreadsheet called 'Cell Count Spreadsheet':

  1. Recorded total cell number was (see above)

13\. Transferred  cell suspension to the pre-warmed  Growth media

1\. 238.66uL of Culture 1 taken to Tube 1

2\. 318.47uL of Culture 2 taken to Tube 2

3\. 295.86uL of Culture 3 taken to Tube 3

All three tubes were spun down for 5 mins at 650g. 14:56 - 15:01

2mL of PBS was added to each tube to resuspend/wash each pellet.

PBS was removed from each tube (as much as possible) and tubes were weighed.

Tubes were then labelled and placed in the main lab -80 freezer.

Tube 1 weight: 6474.2 mg
