Observations/Summary:

At 10:15am, one of the T175 flasks was checked under the main lab Primo
microscope to do a health check before the media change.  
It was found that the cell density was about 3-4 fold lower than expected and
the culture was vastly underconfluent.

This was validated in one of the 4CFs.

It was decided that these cultures would be retained till Thursday to see if
they would grow to confluence (unlikely as the media is not a proliferation
media).

Instead, another 2 x 4CFs will be seeded on Thursday in an attempt to acheive
20,000 cell/cm2 as desired.

Possible causes for low cell density:

  * Cells not spun down at a high enough setting (unlikely as these Nuvonis cells are always spun down at 300g for 5 mins)
  * Calculation error (calculations were double checked)
  * Inaccurate cell count from Cell Supply (unlikely as a count was done on both the Cellaca and ViCell XR machines)
