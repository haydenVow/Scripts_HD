Aim/Purpose


Expand 2.5M  F_CHOMP09 MCB cells to a WCB of ≥ 2 billion cells


Hypothesis


Continued culture of an initial population of 2.5M F_CHOMP09 MCB cells will
allow for a bank of ≥ 2billion cells within 4 passages.


Technical Gap


As we have generated a large WCB from our current F_CHOMP09 MCB stocks
previously. Although this WCB will be larger than the previous, we do not
anticipate any significant challenges for this expansion.

Method/Procedure


Experimental Plan (Approximate timeline)  
D1: seed 2.5 million  cells into 2xT175 (7500 cells/cm2)  
D2: feed  
D5: feed  
D8: passage 2xT175 into 1x 4CF (assuming flasks are at least 80% confluence)  
D11: feed  
D14: feed  
D16: passage 1x4CF into 1x 10CF + 2x 5CS (to allow monitoring of cells)  
D19 or 20: feed  
D22 or D23: passage 1x10CF + 2x 5CS into 9x 10CF + 2x 5CS (assuming flasks at
least 80% confluence)  
D25 or D26: feed  
D28 or D29: bank 9x10CF + 2x 5CS = 2.5 billion cells
