THIS IS A REMINDER ONLY. NOT PART OF THE LAB BOOK ENTRY WORK

Live cell test: NOTE: See 11-June-2021 Testing cell survivability entry  
\- stain one live well with CMFDA and image

\- place pre-warmed fresh media back into the well  

\- return to the incubator

\- check this sample on Friday (first image without staining and see if any
dye remains, then re-stain again with CMFDA this is to see whether cells can
survive CMFDA addition).

Dead cell test:

\- leave the plate which has been exposed to freeze-thaw in the fridge  
\- we should be getting new PI in the next 1-2 days

\- stain with new PI on Friday or when you get the chance (try with and
without CMFDA)

Process:

Live/Dead staining:

Preparation of stock and and working solutions for CMFDA Cell Tracker (used
due to not being able to locate Calcein)

1\. Remove the CMFDA powder from the freezer (main lab) and allow it to warm
to room temperature. Each aliquot is 50 ug.

  1.  Briefly centrifuge the tube to pellet the CMFDA powder

2\. Add 50 uL high-quality, anhydrous DMSO to the powder and pipette up and
down until well suspended. This will yield a 1 mM stock solution.

  1. NOTE - Once prepared, the DMSO stock solution should be stored at -20'C in a 70 mL pot submerged in silica-gel desiccant beads for a short period for one series of experiments. 

*Steps 1 & 2 were conducted the previous day with the DMSO/CMFDA stock solution stored at -20'C (MAIN LAB #71)  

3\. Transfer 5 uL of the 1mM CMFDA stock solution to 2.5 mL of prepared
DMEM/F12 PRF growth media in a light safe 15 mL falcon tube to protect it from
light. Vortex to ensure thorough mixing with the resulting solution being
approximately 2 uM CMFDA working solution.

  1. Note*. Only 5 uL of stock solution was used to preserve quantity and because the amount of media + CMFDA needed was only 2 mL for one well.

4\. Place the pre-aliquoted 10 mL of DMEM/F12 PRF growth media that was
prepared the previous day into the water bath to be warmed.

  1.  Transfer both the CMFDA working stock solution and DMEM/F12 PRF growth media into the water bath to be pre-warmed

5\. Aspirate the growth media from one well (B1) from the non-treated 6-well
plate

6\. Add 2 mL of pre-warmed DMEM/F12 PRF growth media to the non-treated 6-well
plate that had media removed from it in the previous step (well B1) as a rinse
step to remove any residue serum.

7\. Aspirate the growth media from the non-treated 6-well plate well (B1).

8\. Add 2 mL of pre-warmed CMFDA working solution to the B1 well from the non
treated 6-well plate and incubate for 30 minutes at 37'C covered in foil to
protect samples from light.

  1. Start/Finish time was:  11:06 - 11:36
  2.  If the CMFDA working solution is no longer required dispose of solution as aqueous waste as aqueous solutions of CMFDA are susceptible to hydrolysis and should be used within one day.

9\. Without changing the media in the wells, image well (B1) from the non
treated plate on the Zaber fluorescence microscope (channel AF488 for CMFDA
[Live cells])

10\. Replace the CMFDA media with fresh growth media.

10\. Return the non treated plate to the incubator.

11\. Repeat the staining procedure the following day (June 11) to observe
whether cells remain alive following CMFDA staining.
