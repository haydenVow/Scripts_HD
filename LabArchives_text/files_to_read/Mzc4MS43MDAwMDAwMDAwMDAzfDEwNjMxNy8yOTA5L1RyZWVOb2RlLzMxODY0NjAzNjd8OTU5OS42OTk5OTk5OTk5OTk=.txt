Aim/Purpose


1\. To enrich the fibroblast portion of our CHOMP cells by expanding the
plastic adherent component of our raw isolate.

2\. To expand these cells to a master cell bank.  


Hypothesis


1\. Continuous culture of our plastic adherent CHOMP1 cells will allows us to
bank >8M cells as a MCB.

  


Technical Gap


1\. CHOMP1 is a crocodile biopsy recently isolated by Vow. As these cells have
yet to be expanded, we have no prior indication of the health and
proliferative capacity of these cells.

2\. As we are working with raw isolate, the plastic adherent cell population
is also likely to be a non-homogenous, mixed-cell population, and is unlikely
to be comprised solely of fibroblasts.

  


Method/Procedure


Experimental Plan

Key note: Crocodile cells should be cultured in a separate incubator to
mammalian cells. They require a lower incubation temperature of 28 degrees C.  
  
1\. Thaw raw isolate of CHOMP1.  

  * Warm ( to 28 degrees C) an aliquot of M199 + 15% FBS + 1x PS + 20ng/mL EGF ( crocodile growth media). 
  * 1 x vial of frozen cell isolate from CHOMP1 will be thawed and plated into 1x 6 well plate. Non-coated plates will be used to aid preferential selection of fibroblasts. Incubate at 28Â°C and 5% CO2.
  * Once cells have adhered to the vessel, the seeding media containing unattached cells will be removed, and replaced with fresh growth media. 

2\. Monitor/ feed plastic adherent CHOMP1 cells

  * Every other day, image the plate & write observations regarding cell proliferation and morphology.
  * Perform a 50% feed approximately every 72 hours.

3\. Expansion passages

  * When cells appear 80-90% confluent, passage following SOP_Passaging Adherent Cells V_04 using non-coated culture vessels.
  * Cells should be seeded at approximately 7000-7500 cells/cm2.

4\. Passage + Bank master cell bank of plastic adherent CHOMP1 cells.

  * When cell numbers are sufficient to be 90% confluent across approximately 4x T175 flasks (700cm/2), bank cells as a MCB following Banking-Template_V2 .
