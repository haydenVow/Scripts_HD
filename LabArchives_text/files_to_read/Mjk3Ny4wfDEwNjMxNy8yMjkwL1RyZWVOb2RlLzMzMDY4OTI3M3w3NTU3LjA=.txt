Preparation of stock and and working solutions for CMFDA Cell Tracker

1\. Remove the CMFDA powder from the freezer (main lab) and allow it to warm
to room temperature. Each aliquot is 50 ug.

  1.  Briefly centrifuge the tube to pellet the CMFDA powder

2\. Add 50 uL high-quality, anhydrous DMSO to the powder and pipette up and
down until well suspended. This will yield a 1 mM stock solution.

  1. NOTE - Once prepared, the DMSO stock solution should be stored at -20'C in a 70 mL pot submerged in silica-gel desiccant beads for a short period for one series of experiments. 

3\. Transfer 40 uL of the 1mM CMFDA stock solution to 20 mL of prepared
DMEM/F12 PRF growth media in a light safe 50 mL falcon tube to protect it from
light. Vortex to ensure thorough mixing with the resulting solution being
approximately 2 uM CMFDA working solution.

4\. Prepare a separate 36 mL of DMEM/F12 PRF growth media.

  1.  Transfer both the CMFDA working stock solution and DMEM/F12 PRF growth media into the water bath to be pre-warmed   14:48   

5\. Aspirate the media from all the wells both cell seeded and cell free
scaffolds

6\. Add 1 mL of pre-warmed DMEM/F12 PRF growth media to the wells from each
plate as a rinse step to remove any residual serum.

7\. Aspirate the rinsing media from both plates

8\. Add 500 uL of pre-warmed CMFDA working solution to the each well in both
plate and incubate for 30 minutes at 37'C covered in foil to protect samples
from light.

  1. Start/Finish time was:  15:06 - 15:36  

  2.  If the CMFDA working solution is no longer required dispose of solution as aqueous waste as aqueous solutions of CMFDA are susceptible to hydrolysis and should be used within one day.

9\. Remove 450 uL of staining solution from each well

10\. Image all wells from both plates on the Zaber fluorescence microscope
(channel AF488 for CMFDA [Live cells]). Remember to image both sides.

11\. Transfer all the scaffolds into a new 48 well plate containing inserts.

12\. Replace all wells with 1 mL fresh E6 growth media

13\. Return both plates to the incubator.

Observations/Summary:

\- Very little amount of cells on scaffolds




Results:

  * Results were;
    * [ ]  As Usual (this is a repetitive task)
    * [x]  Unexpected because... no cells could be seen on scaffolds
    * [ ]  Need to be further analysed
    * [ ]  Other (.......)
