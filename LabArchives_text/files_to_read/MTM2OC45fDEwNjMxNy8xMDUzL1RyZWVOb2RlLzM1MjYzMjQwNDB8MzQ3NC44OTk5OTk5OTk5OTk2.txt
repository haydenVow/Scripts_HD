Images captured from the 11-May-2021 were processed using two new FIJI macros
designed to give an estimation of cell count per microcarrier. The macros can
be found attached. Image pairs from Day 1 on MIA capture were copy and pasted
into FIJI and the macros were run on each image pair. The process to process
each image pair went as follow

  1.  Copy and Paste the DAPI image from the pair into FIJI (e.g A1)
  2. Copy and Paste the corresponding Phase image from the pair into FIJI 
  3. Run the 'Microcarrier detector V2' Macro, wait for the generation of the 'Centroid Map' window
  4. Run the 'Cytodex 1 count per microcarrier' macro, wait for the results table to be generated
  5. Copied the 'Count' results to a separate spreadsheet on google drive here https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/13F7hMkfOeq9JoHBSuDO--aIIA3BsiU27CxkR9yAdvKs/edit#gid=0

  




These new FIJI Macros were generated after our previous MIA tool 'uCarrier
cell count plastic' tool failed to process the images correctly. Phase images
were not processed correctly and microcarriers could not be counted.
