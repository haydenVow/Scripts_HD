### Process:

3\. Aliquotted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then
placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath for a minimum of 20 minutes
prior to use:

  1. TrypLE:      3   mL in       1x50mL  tubes
  2.  dPBS (for neutralising):    3    mL
  3.  dPBS (for washing):     3   mL
  4. Growth media (for seeding):    30   mL 

Time that all aliquots were placed in the water bath the warm before use
13:35   a/pm

Note: if aliquots were placed in water bath at different time, record the time
stamp for each individual solution.




4\. Removed vessel(s) from the incubator     :   a/pm

5\. Washed the vessel(s) with dPBS (warmed).

6\. Added     0.25   mL tryple to each well and incubated at 30˚C.

  1. Start/Finish for TrypLE was     13:53-13:58   a/pm 

7\. Neutralised with     0.27 mL     dPBS and combined cell suspension into a
15mL    tubes (1 per well).

8\. Centrifuged at 300 x g for 5 min.

  1. Start/Finish time for centrifugation was     :   a/pm  (5 mins)




9\. Aspirated the supernatant(s).

10\. Resuspended pellet(s) in     3mL    mL     growth     media     :   a/pm

11\. The full 3 mL was transfered to wells of 6 well plates  

12\. No cell count was performed.  




13\. Transferred  30mL of cell containing Growth media to each of 5 T175
flasks (non gelatin coated)  

16\. Transferred vessel(s) to incubate at:     14:45    a/pm , incubator #68  

  * [x]  30ºC, 5% CO2 (Reptile cells)
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (avian cells)




Observations/Summary:

cell confluence was <95%

Version Change Log

NameChange Details  
V1 (original)N/A  
V2Changed all sentences to past tense to better reflect a hand-written lab
book entry.  
Various formatting changes.  
Addition of more detail to step 2, removal of step 3. Replaced volume
requirements table with updated volumes @Sep 22, 2020  
Updated temperature selection for mammalian/aviary cells @Sep 23, 2020  
V3Included a section for 'vessel type' in passage ID table Replace
'flask/plate' with 'vessel' throughout lab book Include at step 1 to take
image of vessel on the microscope  
Mentioned that dPBS for washing should be warm - step 3(2) and 5.  
Added timepoint at step 4 for when vessel is removed from incubator  
Include at step 11 to aliquot cell resuspension into microcentrifuge tube  
Included at step 10 and 13 time point for when cell pellet is resuspended and
when resuspended cells is moved into growth media.  
Included p38i in table of regent used  
Combined two dPBS entries in 'Media/reagents' table Added 'cell density per
vessel'
