AIM/PURPOSE: To test whether Hoechst staining cells affects their viability
and which method of staining is best for maintaining viability.

HYPOTHESIS:

Hoechst staining cells in a 96 wp with 8 uL/well for 24 hours will result in
cell death. However, staining with 8uL/well for 1 h, 4uL/well for 24 h, or
4uL/well for 1 h will not affect cell viability.

Note: staining volume refers to a 1:1 Hoechst + PBS solution

RESULTS SUMMARY:

The hypothesis was not supported. Staining with 8uL/well resulted in cell
death but staining at 4uL/well for 24 h was also harmful for cell viability.

There's a significant drop in cell viability when cells are Hoechst stained
for 24 h versus 1 h. There is also a decrease in cell viability when 8uL/well
of staining solution is used instead of 4uL/well.

CONCLUSIONS:

Moving forwards, we should use 4uL/well of staining solution for 1 hour for 96
well plates. This experiment was originally performed after we observed cell
death in EPIC21181. However, it turns out that Hoechst ReadyFlow reagent was
used in EPIC21181 rather than Hoechst ReadyProbes (which was used for this
experiment). We should use Hoechst ReadyProbes in the SCC pipelines as the
ReadyFlow reagent may cause more cell death.

NEXT STEPS:

We should test the effect of staining cells multiple times over multiple
passages (see EPIC25114). We should also stain the unstained control at the
final timepoint and possibly perform staining for dead cells as well as live.
