### Process:

1\. Aliquotted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then
placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath for a minimum of 20 minutes
prior to use:

  1. TrypLE:     15    mL in     1 x 15 ml    tube
  2.  dPBS (for neutralising):      15   mL
  3.  dPBS (for washing):    15     mL
  4. dPBS (for pellet resuspension and wash off serum):     9    mL

All aliquots were left at room temperature for this passage

Note: if aliquots were placed in water bath at different time, record the time
stamp for each individual solution.




4\. Removed vessel(s) from the incubator     16:02  pm

5\. Washed the vessel(s) with dPBS (warmed).

6\. Added     5    mL tryple to each vessel/well and incubated at 37ËšC.

  1. Start/Finish for TrypLE was     16:20 - 16:25 pm 

7\. Neutralised with     5     dPBS and combined respective cell suspensions
into individual     15 ml    tubes.

8\. Centrifuged at 400 x g for 5 min.




9\. Aspirated the supernatant(s).

10\. Resuspended pellet(s) in     1    mL   dPBS for each target gene.  

11\. Separated cell suspension of each gene target into 2 x 1.5 ml tubes
(500uL each)

12\. Centrifuged for 5 minutes at 300g, then aspirated the supernatant.

13\. Froze down one raw pellet from each condition for DNA extraction in the
-20 freezer in library lab (bottom shelf) and one raw pellet from each
condition for RNA extraction in the -80 freezer in library lab (top shelf).

all three samples for both DNA and RNA extraction were placed in a 50mL yellow
lid pot
