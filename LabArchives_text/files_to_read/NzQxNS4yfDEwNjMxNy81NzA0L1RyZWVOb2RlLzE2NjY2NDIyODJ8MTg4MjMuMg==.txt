Top Contherm

10mL aliquot of E6 in media + gelatin fridge in main lab. Aliquot is in a blue
capped 15mL door. Located in door on the second shelf. Take one of the
aliquots.  
  
  
  

  

  

  
  
  
Starting deck state  
  
  

Startup and calibration:

  1. Switched on HEPA filter (top of robot, switch on left) and the OT2 robot.
  2. Wiped the base/desk of the robot with 70% (v/v) EtOH. Do not wipe the sides (clear acrylic panels) with ethanol. OT2 should be treated like a BSC for maintaining sterility. Spray and wipe any items with ethanol before placing into OT2. 
  3. Connected to the robot from a lab computer by using the OpenTrons app. 
  4. Uploaded "buffy6feed.py" found in the Downloads folder to the Opentrons app.
  5. Arranged labware and reagents on the OT2 as shown in the deck layout. 
  6. Poured 10mL warmed aliquot of E6 in the first well of the 15mL reservoir.
  7. Clicked  Proceed to calibrate. 
  8. Calibrated to labware by following the instructions on the app and then ran the protocol.  

E6 placed in water bath at:   10:45   am

Start time:   14:28

Summary of protocol:

  * Remove 200uL of E6 
  * Remove another 200uL of E6 to level all volumes
  * Add gradients of E6 volumes to each column

End time:    14:33

  

Termination and cleaning:

  1. Once the protocol is complete, discarded tips in the yellow biowaste bin. Sprayed and wiped the trash tray with ethanol before returning it to the robot. Liquid waste should be collected in bottles, and PFA waste should be discarded into the PFA waste container. OT2 reservoirs are reusable. They should be sprayed with Viraclean if they contained cell suspensions and then washed in eucalyptus disinfectant. Then they need to be soaked in water, dried, and autoclaved.'
  2. Removed all labware from OT2 and wipe the base/deck of the OT2 with ethanol. The pipette head can also be cleaned with 70% ethanol. Wiped the sides (clear acrylic panels) with working solution of bleach (10-15%) and then dried with a RediWipe.
