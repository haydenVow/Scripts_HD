Process:

  1. Imaged 4X T25s, 2x each at 10X magnification.
  2. Aliquotted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath for a minimum of 20 minutes prior to use:
    * Growth media:
      1. 11 mL x D/F + 10%FBS + 1xP/S  

      2. 11 mL x E8_10C
    * Time that all aliquots were placed in the incubator to warm before use  14 :24     

  3. Collected 4X T25s from incubator, wiped with ethanol-sprayed Rediwipe, and brought into a BSC.
  4. Removed   100 % of supernatant from vessel. 
  5. Replaced with  5 mL (per T25 vessel) of each respective media. 
  6. Returned vessel to incubate at: 15:02

  * [X]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (aviary cells)
