Aim/Purpose


to build a suitable vessel to scale maturation, initially by keeping cells
alive in a "giant media pot" that requires minimal operator interaction


Hypothesis


We can ascertain sterility of the vessel and cells have access to nutrients
and oxygen to a degree comparable with a 6-well plate


Technical Gap


We do not have an efficient general method to assess cell viability on
scaffolds. Therefore, both adherence and encapsulation samples will be
included in the reactor runs (Alginate to stain by MTT, Zein to stain by
Calcein or Hoechst)


Method/Procedure


  1. Build reactor (needs to fit in incubator, >100 cm2 culture area, non-toxic material)
  2. Test if parts can withstand autoclaving or other forms of sterilization
  3. "dry run" to test for leakage, general parameters, deposits, sterility, ease of handling etc
  4. "wet run" to assess viability vs traditional well plate maturation
    1. prep scaffolds
    2. grow and harvest cells
    3. seed cells and fill with media
    4. assess viability after x days in growth media and E6
  5. repeat to assess reliability before handoff to production
