Plan  
  
Cell lines  
both MUSCO and KHAKIO lines will be trialed as these lines are currently being
used for suspension adaption experiments. In addition we will trial the
Nuvonis Quail line as the colorimetric assay may be of use in media
optimization trials currently underway for 1st product.  
  
Establishing a standard curve limits of detection  
Cells will be harvested from planar culture and counted using the gold
standard method of trypan blue counts staining and manual counting with a
hemocytometer. Counts will be performed in triplicate to ensure accuracy.
Cells will then be seeded into 96 well plates via serial dilution as per the
table below. After each column is seeded, 800ul of media will be added to the
cell suspension to create a serial dilution of cells. A column of media
without cells should also be added as a blank.  
Total number of cells required for each cell line: 800,000

The assay will be run following the manufacturers instructions. See here:
https://www.abcam.com/ps/products/228/ab228554/documents/Cell-Counting-Kit-
protocol-book-v2d-ab228554%20(website).pdf. Essentially each well of the 96
well plate is seeded with 100ul cells + 10ul of the CCK8 reagent. Plates are
then incubated prior to being read at 460nm on the plate reader. In order to
optimize incubation period, the plates should be read after 30min, 1hr, 2hr
and 4hr.
