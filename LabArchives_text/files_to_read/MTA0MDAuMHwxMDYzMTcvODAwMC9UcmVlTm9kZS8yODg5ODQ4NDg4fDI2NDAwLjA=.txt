Cell Count:

  1. Sampled 1mL per flask for trypan blue staining & counting
  2. For manual counting, pipetted 20uL suspension and diluted with an equal volume of trypan blue for 1:2 dilution and performed cell count (manual)
  3. Sampled 200ul from 1mL aliquot in eppendorf tube. Placed Nucelocounter cassette in tube and depressed cassette 
  4. Counts:
    * 12039: 
      * Manual count: 780 000 cells/mL
      * Nucleocounter count: 997 000 cells/mL (96.1% viability, 20.5 um diameter, 3.6% aggregation)
    * 12040:  
      * Manual count: 810 000 cell/mL
      * Nucleocounter count: 1 120 000 cell/mL (90.5% viability, 21.7um diameter, 12.6% aggregation)  




Process:

  1. Prepared and aliquotted media into sterile vessels:
    * 310mL Freestyle media (added EGF and IGF 1:5000 and 1:1000 respectively)
    * 250mL 3:1 Mix Media (already prepared with growth factors)
  2. Incubated in bead bath at 2:30pm
  3. Removed media from bead bath at 2:50pm and added media to x4 E500 flasks:
    * +136mL Freestyle (1)
    * +56mL Freestyle and +80mL 3:1 Mix (2,3,4)
  4. Removed cells from incubator at 3:00pm. Combined cell suspension into single flask and aliquotted 24mL per E500
  5.  Returned cells to incubator at 3:15pm 37degC 120RPM
