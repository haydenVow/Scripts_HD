9\. Total cell number was:33 300 000 cells of which 3 937 500 will be reseeded
into 3 x T175  

10\. Seeded ~7,5k cells per cm2 of the flasks/plates. Note that fibroblasts
prefer to be subcultured closely together.

11\. Volume of cell suspension required for subculture was:    591 uL  

12\. Transfer   591 µL of cell suspension to the pre-warmed  90 mL Growth
Media.

13\. Transfer cell suspension into (non-gelatin coated)      3 x T175
flasks/plates.

14\. Transfer flask/plate(s) to incubate at:

  * [ ]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (aviary cells)
  * [X] 30ºC, 5% CO2 (reptilian cells)
