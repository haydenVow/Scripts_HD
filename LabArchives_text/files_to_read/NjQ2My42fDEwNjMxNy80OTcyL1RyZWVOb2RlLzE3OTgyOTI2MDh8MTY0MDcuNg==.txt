1\. Aliquotted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then
placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath for a minimum of 20 minutes
prior to use:

  * Time that aliquot was placed in the water bath to warm before use:  14 : 56  

  




## Thaw and seed F_CHOMP09 vials:

1\. Collected the cryovial from Liquid Nitrogen storage & place in foam
floater in water bath for 5 min  17:46 - 17: 51

Location where cryovial was collected from:

Vial details:   2  x  F_CHOMP09 WCB  cryovials at  10 M  cells each for a
total of   20 M  cells

Brew

Tower/Bucket #5  

Box/Cane #4  

Vial location: A1-A2  

Vial ID(s):

3521-Culture-8616-Vial-1of50  
3522-Culture-8616-Vial-2of50  

`4. Ethanol sprayed & transferred the vial(s) to the BSC.`

`5.  Added  750 µL of Growth Media (to generate a total volume of 1.8mL in the
cryovial) to the cryovial, resuspended the cell suspension gently to reduce
osmotic shock. (Note there was already > 1 mL in cryovial)  
`

`6. 7. Take 10 uL aliquot from each resuspended cryovial and perform cell
count. https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1DPzKubYxfHmWogVPihC-
SSIBtIylyrBQE5kRX5Z8NtI/edit#gid=0  
``Total cell count (3521) = `6,062,400, dead 129,600  
`3521`  

`6. Collected the entire 1mL of cell suspension & transfer into the pre-warmed
tube of Growth Media. `

`7. Using a 10mL serological pipette, resuspended & distributed the cells
evenly in the  360 mL of pre-warmed Growth Media (prepared in Step 2). `

`8. Transferred  30 mL to each of 12x T175  flasks`

`9. Transferred flask/plate(s) to incubate at: 18:24`

  * [X]  30ºC, 5% CO2 (reptilian cells) Incubator 68, library lab
  * [ ]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (avian cells)

  

Making labels

Note - You will need to increase the passage number by one. (i.e. if your
thawed vial ID has a passage number of 3, when you make a culture ID for you
vessel you will need change the passage number to 4 on Airtable.)

  




## Thaw and seed F_DOLLY12 vial:

1\. Collected the cryovial from Liquid Nitrogen storage & place in foam
floater in water bath for 5 min  18:44 - 18:48

Location where cryovial was collected from:

Vial details:   1  x  F_DOLLY12 WCB  cryovials at  2.5 M  cells each for a
total of   2.5 M  cells

Brew

Tower/Bucket #4

Box/Cane #5  

Vial location: C4  

Vial ID(s):

3116-Culture-7346-Vial-4of38  

`4. Ethanol sprayed & transferred the vial(s) to the BSC.`

`5.  Added  400 µL of Growth Media (to generate a total volume of 1mL in the
cryovial) to the cryovial, resuspended the cell suspension gently to reduce
osmotic shock. `

`6. Collected the entire 1mL of cell suspension & transfer into the pre-warmed
tube of Growth Media. `

`7. Using a 10mL serological pipette, resuspended & distributed the cells
evenly in the  60 mL of pre-warmed Growth Media (prepared in Step 2). `

`8. Transferred  30 mL to each of 2x T175  flasks`

`9. Transferred flask/plate(s) to incubate at: 19:00`

  * [ ]  30ºC, 5% CO2 (reptilian cells)
