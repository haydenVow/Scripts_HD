Process:  

  1. Aliquot 70mL Nuvonis suspension media base
  2. In the BSC, add 3.5ul EGF, 140ul FGF2 and 70ul IGF1-LR3
  3. Place in the water bath and warm to 37C 
  4. Collect vessels from shaker, and brought into BSC 
  5. Broke up cell clumps by pipetting 5-10 times with a 10mL serological. Combined contents of 11807, 11808, 11809 and 11810 and then put 20mL into each of 2x E-125 flasks.
  6. Broke up cell clumps by pipetting 5-10 times with a 10mL serological.  Transferred contents of culture11478 to an e-125 flask and added an additional 10mL of pre-warmed culture media, along with 1ul YIGSR.
  7. Broke up cell clumps by pipetting 5-10 times with a 10mL serological.  Transferred contents of culture 11479 into 2x e-125 flasks (5mL per flask), then added an additional 15mL pre-warmed media along with .75ul RGD to each flask.
  8. Broke up cell clumps by pipetting 5-10 times with a 10mL serological.  Transferred contents of culture 11479 into 2x e-125 flasks (5mL per flask), then added an additional 15mL pre-warmed media along with .75ul RGD to each flask.
  9. Broke up cell clumps by pipetting 5-10 times with a 10mL serological. Combined contents of 11811, 11812 and 11813 and transferred 15mL into each of 2x E-125 flasks. Added an additional 5mL pre-warmed media along with .25ul RGD and .5ul RGD to each flask. 
  10. Returned all tubes to incubator on shaking platform, which should be pre-set to 120RPM 

incubator 160 Library Lab, 37C, 5% CO2




Observations

Cells containing binding peptides contained large clumps which were dispersed
relatively easily with pipetting. The cultures containing only Nuvonis
suspension media + FGF2 did not contain as many, or as large clumps.
