Process:

  1. Made up a bulk of 100mL DMEM/F12 + LAA2P (150ug/mL) + 1X P/S (M12844) and sterile filtered using syringe and filters.
  2. Performed a test on the solubility of Albumin by weighing out 300mg of BSA into 8mL of DMEM/F12 to test the solubility of the upper limit concentration value. Solubility was acheived by tapping and placing in water bath to ensure no foaming occured.
  3. Weighed out 600mg of Recombinant Human Albumin (S3856) and dissolved in 16mL of Vit C basal media made up in Step 1. Sterile filtered using syringe filters.
  4. Used concentrated stock made up above to make up various aliquots as shown below.

  1. Performed cell count on Culture 12588 from Cell Supply Team using ViCell XR. Took 550uL of culture medium for cell counting, however the machine threw an error. Another 550uL aliquot was taken for cell counting which was successful.
  2. Cell count was 2.2 million cells per mL.
  3. Removed 600uL from each condition aliquot to make the total volume in each tube 1.4mL (need 1.2mL at 150uL media per well - 200uL excess).
  4. Aliquotted 1mL of culture media into a 15mL falcon tube.
  5. Took 42uL aliquots and suspended in each of the 11 condition tubes + 1 serum control tube.
  6. Mixed each condition aliquot thoroughly before seeding in 96 well plate (4:30pm)
  7. Transferred plate to Incubator 52 in Main Lab (37C, 5% CO2)




Calculations:

Cells required in each well = 10,000 cells

Total cells needed = 10,000 cells x 96 wells = 960,000 (round up to 1M
approx.)

Cell count from Cell Supply culture = 2.2M cells/mL

Aliquot taken from culture = 600uL (1.32M cells)

Amount of 600uL aliquot resuspended in each 1.4mL condition aliquot (see
table) = 500uL/12 conditions = 42uL per condition aliquot (91,666 cells per
column/condition or 11M cells approx per well)




Observations/Summary:

Cells taken from cell supply team to seed out Albumin optimisation media
study. Albumin is to be assessed in a range of concentrations to find ideal
concentration for cell adherence in ACF media.
