## Thaw and seed vial:

1\. Pre-filled 3 x T175 flask with 30mL of growth media and placed in
incubator (to equilibrate media pH prior to seeding) 13:00

2\. Aliquoted 1mL growth media (for resuspension) and placed in water bath
14:00

3\. Collected the cryovial from Liquid Nitrogen storage & place in foam
floater in water bath for 5 min  14:10-14:15  

Vial details:   1  cryovial at   500K  cells each for a total of  500K cells

Brew

Tower/Bucket # 1  

Box/Cane # 5

Vial location: C7  

Vial ID(s): 2825

  

`4. Ethanol sprayed & transferred the vial(s) to the BSC.`

`5.  Added  500µL of Growth Media (to generate a total volume of 1mL in the
cryovial) to the cryovial, resuspended the cell suspension gently to reduce
osmotic shock. `

`7. Collected the entire 330ul of cell suspension & transfer into each of the
pre-warmed T175 flasks.  
`

`8. Using a 10mL serological pipette, resuspended & distributed the cells
evenly. ``  
`

`9. Transfered flask/plate(s) to incubate at: 14:20`

  1. [ x]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)

Making labels

Note - You will need to increase the passage number by one. (i.e. if your
thawed vial ID has a passage number of 3, when you make a culture ID for you
vessel you will need change the passage number to 4 on Airtable.)

### Results:

  * Results were;
    * [ x]  As Usual (this is a repetitive task)
    * [ ]  Unexpected because...
    * [ ]  Need to be further analysed
    * [ ]  Other (.......)
