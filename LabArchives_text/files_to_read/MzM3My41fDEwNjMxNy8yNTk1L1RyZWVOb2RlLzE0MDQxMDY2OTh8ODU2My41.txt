  1. Added | X g|  dry Cytodex microcarriers to a suitably siliconized (made non-stick by coating with Sigmacote) glass bottle.
    1. Recommended to use the 500 mL Duran bottle with the red lid
    2. Use 5 g of dry Cytodex 1 for every 1 L of final working volume in the bioreactor
  2. PBS (free of Ca2+, Mg2+) (~50 mL per g dry Cytodex 1) was added to the bottle and the microcarriers allowed to swell for at least 1.5 h in the incubator at 165 RPM shaking speed.   

  3. The supernatant was removed and replaced with fresh PBS (free of Ca2+, Mg2+) (~50 mL/g dry Cytodex 1). Carriers were washed with gentle agitation for a few minutes by hand.
  4. Carriers were allowed to settle once more and the supernatant was discarded and replaced with fresh PBS (free of Ca2+, Mg2+) (50 mL/g Cytodex) 
  5. The bottle was stored with the bioreactor vessel ready for autoclaving.

  5. Ensured that the correct male and female parts were connected.
    1. The SEED and FEED bottles should be connected to the extra-long lines attached to the 4-way addition port in the headplate
    2. The BASE bottle should be connected to a short line attached to the 4-way addition port in the headplate

NotesGenerally, bottles containing liquids going into the culture should be
connected to the multiport on the top of the reactor. Don't connect
microcarrier containing innoculum to the multiport, it will block the tube.
Instead, fill via the harvest tube
