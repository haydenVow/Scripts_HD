Figure 1. Tissue engineering mould plate layout for experiment 3  \-  There
are 4 conditions with 3 tissue replicates per plate. The testing gel matrix
conditions are the same in each plate. However, plate one will be cultured in
50:50 RPMI:Hycell+ Nuvonis growth medium, and plate 2 will be cultured in
DMEM/F12+10%FBS

  




Before Starting Ensure:

  * Matrix reagents are made up fresh:
    * Collagen I to 2.6mg/mL - stock is at 6.17mg/mL - dilution factor 1:2.4
      * need ~  1705.2uL total (make 3 mL)
        * 1264uL Collagen added to 1736uL autoclaved milliQ 
    * Matrigel is thawed in the fridge (no more than 10degs) first thing in the morning to maintain as liquid
    * Reagents have been sterile-filtered
  *  ~~Agar is autoclaved first thing in the morning and maintained on the hotplate to keep molten (or a small, high temp Sous Vide bath)~~




Scaffold mounting, sterilisation and coating

  1. Make up 10ml PDMS per dish
  2. Add 9ml of PDMS into 15cm dish, spin coat for 3-5 seconds per dish
  3. Mount mould into PDMS
  4. Heat for 45mins at 60degs to set moulds into PDMS
  5. Place in 70% Ethanol overnight    22/06/2022  
  6. Using forceps, dry dishes in BSC until no ethanol remains 10:15 
  7. UV irradiate for 60 minutes under the mobile UV (reptile) lamp - start   11:15 -12:15
  8. Pre-coat with 0.25% Pluronic solution for 1 hour (to prevent adhesion), start  12:20




Preparation for Harvest

  1. Prepare 1 falcon tube for cell harvest for 4 conditions of different Matrigel concentrations 
  2. Completed calculations can be found here: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1nAKlh6US6Xud95YGlDTkI4LHBWjzlAxnhmTym1P2bUw/edit#gid=561508067
  3. Media preparation for harvest and seeding: 50-50 RPMI/Hycell mix
    1. Aliquot 13mL of 50-50 RPMI/Hycell  growth medium (GM) and add growth factors (concentration listed in the E8 Calculator)
    2. Aliquot 13mL of  DMEM/F12+10%FBS 

Cell Harvest for mould seeding - Nuvonis suspesion protocol

  1. Harvest cells with Cell Supply passaging protocol
  2. Count cells with haemocytometer/Vicell for total yields:
    1. Total yield flask #12589 =    440 million   

    2. Total volume per flask #12589 =    134.35mL  
    3. Cell concentration # =     3.26M cells/mL  
  3. Aliquot cell suspension from the culture flask into 1x falcon tubes:
    1.    15 M cells /mL  = 63M    cell total required for experiment (24 tissues across 2x plates). Thus, we need to aliquot a cell suspension total volume of =    19.325mL  # into a 50mL falcon tube.
    2. Take a 10uL aliquot and perform a manual cell count using a hemocytometer. and record in the cell count spread sheet. 
      1. Total cell count (in 19.3mL GM) = 52,032,800  cells at 2.696 M  cells/mL
  4. Centrifuge at 650g for 5 minutes: start  15:28 - 15:33 
  5. Resuspend pellets in   600uL of 50-50 Media 
  6. Then measure out exactly how much the cells has increased the volume by using the P1000.
  7. Top up the cell suspension to  1843.8uL 
  8. Aliquot the respective volumes of cell+media needed per condition.  
    1. 9% Matrigel: 413.7 uL
    2. 6% Matrigel: 445.2 uL 
    3. 3% Matrigel: 476.7 uL
    4. 0% Matrigel: 508.2 uL 
  9. Proceed to matrix additions below.

tissues/condition)

  

Figure 2. Diagram of the step-by-step procedure for creating the cell matrix.

N.B. Repeat this gel formation for each Eppendorf tube at the same time - i.e.
Add Collagen to all, then add DMEM to all etc. - BUT be sure to move quickly!

  1. Add Collagen I (Devro: final concentration 2.6mg/ml) and mix well with stripette (not resuspending):
    1. Collagen I volume to add =     426.3uL  
  2. Add 10xDMEM/F12 and mix with stripette:
    1. 10x DMEM volume to add =    51.45iL  
  3. Add 0.1M Sodium Hydroxide and mix with stripette:
    1. NaOH volume to add =    64.05uL  
  4. Add Matrigel and mix with stripette:
    1. Matrigel volume needed to each (for each condition)
      1. 9% Matrigel  94.5uL  
      2. 6% Matrigel  63uL  
      3. 3% Matrigel  31.5L  
      4. 0% Matrigel   0uL 
  5. Remove pluronic from wells
  6. Seed    150uL    gel/matrix gently into scaffold ensuring good distribution around pillars in the well. 
  7. Leave for    60-90    minutes to gel at 37°C - start time    16:58 -18:00 pm  
  8. Add     ~13 mL   50-50 Media to entire dish, ensure entire mould is covered. 
  9. Culture at 37°C overnight before checking.   




Tips and Tricks for this protocol:

  * When pelleting cells, make sure they are completely dry
  * Flick pellet to dislodge before adding medium
  * Add Medium first to pellet to prevent clumping and cell death
  * Col1 is very viscous, pipette carefully - when adding 10x DMEM, it turns yellow
  * As soon as you add the NaOH, be quick as the Col starts to gel
  * Everything has to be exact, don't be tempted to add more cells than the volume stated if there are some left
  * Add cells slowly!




Results

  * Tissues were observed ~45 minutes after placing in the incubator from 4:58 PM - 5:50 (23 JUN. 2022).
    * There was preliminary evidence of tissue formation in all the wells. 
  * Tissues were observed ~24 hours after placing in the incubator (10:00AM 24 JU. 2022)
