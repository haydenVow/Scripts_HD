Prep of both hydrolysate stock solutions:

Before adding the hydrolysates into the media they will first have to be
prepared as a stock solution. To make it easier in determining how much of the
stock solution needs to added to the growth media its best to prepare a stock
solution of 10% (w/v) (i.e. 100g of hydrolysate in 1 L of Milli-Q water).
Fortunately, if 1 L of solution is not required the volume can be easily
adjusted.

1\. Retrieve hydrolysates from the cell expansion fridge - Difco Soytone Stock
#3492 and Bacto TC Yeastolate Stock #3490

2\. Weigh out 5 g of each hydrolysate.

3\. Add the 5 g powder to 50 mL of Milli-Q water. According to this technical
sheet the hydrolysates should be soluble in purified water and the solution
should appear to be clear to slightly hazy.

4\. Sterile filtered the dissolved hydrolysate solution through a 0.22 um
filter unit in the MAIN LAB. This concentrate can then be used to add the
hydrolysates into the growth media.

5\. Store solution at 4'C for 2-4 weeks.  

  

Prep of growth media:

1\. Prep growth media mix and store at 4'C

*Growth Media: RPMI + 10% FBS + 1X P/S + hydrolysate (5g/L)

RPMI = 84 mL

FBS = 10 mL

P/S = 1 mL

Hydrolysate stock solution = 5 mL

In order to make media with hydrolysates at 5g/L just add 5 mL of the
hydrolysate concentrate to 100 mL of growth media.
