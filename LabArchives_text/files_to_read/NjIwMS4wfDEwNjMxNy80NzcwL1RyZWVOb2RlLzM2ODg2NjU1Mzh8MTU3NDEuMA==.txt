Media/Reagents used:

fed)  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  




Process:

  1. Aliquotted  21 mL  mL of  E6 Media 
  2. Placed in water bath 13:30 - 14:20 pm 
  3. Imaged all wells of plate ID 8706 and the first three columns of plate ID 8707 (a 4x image per well on the Primo should be fine).
  4. Removed 100% of supernatant from vessel, changing tips while aspirating from each column (as the seeding conditions vary columnwise).
  5. Replaced with 1mL (per well/per vessel) of E6 media using a fresh tip.
  6. Returned vessel to incubate at: 14:25 pm

### Observations/Summary:

 100 % media changed on all vessel(s): 8706, 8707

  

  

  

8707:

column 1 has floating cell mass - some live cells on the base of the well,
however a lot of clumps of dead? cells.

Column 2 slightly yellow media

Well C1 has a piece of cracked plastic - assume its from the lid?

  

8706
