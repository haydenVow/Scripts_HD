Note: The TGFb used in this experiment was not reconstituted according to the
manufacturer's instructions which may have impacted results.

MILESTONE: Optimise ACF media to promote >50% cell fusion on at least one
scaffold  

AIM/PURPOSE: To test which ACF media formulation used during proliferation
results in the most amount of differentiation. To confirm the findings from
our first two 16 factor DSDs.

HYPOTHESIS: Adding ingredients that were found to improve differentiation in
EPIC12970 (ethanolamine, p38i, IL-6, IGF-LR3) as well as removing ingredients
that were found to be detrimental for differentiation in EPIC12970 and
EPIC15448 (GABA, EGF, LIF) from E810C media will result in a proliferation
media that allows at least 10 cell doublings followed by differentiation in
E6. Differentiation after proliferation in this media will be better than
using serum based proliferation media or just E810C.

RESULTS SUMMARY:

Because the cells in ACF media did not proliferate as expected, we were not
able to test the downstream effect of these media on differentiation of cells.

CONCLUSIONS: The hypothesis could not be tested.

NEXT STEPS:

We should explore other ACF media formulations to find media that better
support cell doublings in long-term culture of muscle stem cells. Therefore,
we will test the use of 'Beefy-9' media that was described by Stout et al 2021
for our cells. In addition, we will test the passaging method detailed in the
paper which involved the delayed addition of albumin to ACF media to allow
better adhesion of cells. We will also test the use of coatings such as
vitronectin or laminin. See EPIC 19442 for details.
