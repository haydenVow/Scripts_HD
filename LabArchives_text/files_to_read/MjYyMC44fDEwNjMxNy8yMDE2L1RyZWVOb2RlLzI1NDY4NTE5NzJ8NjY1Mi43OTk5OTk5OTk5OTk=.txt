Growth Media (for resuspension):

  * [x]  DMEM/F12 + 20% FBS + 1X P/S.




Process:

Gelatin coated 9 wells on 3x 96 well plates using 0.1um filtered 0.1% w/v
gelatin dissolved in milliQ water. 50uL was added to wells B2-4, C2-4 and D2-4
across each plate. These plates will be used for a differentiation assay.

Gelatin coated 6 wells on 1x96 well palte with the same gelatin solution, 50uL
was added to wells B2-B6. These plates will be used for a myogenic purity
assessment assay.

Placed all gelatin coated plates in the incubator to incubate at [  13:24   ]

 1\. Aliquoted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then
placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath for a minimum of 20 minutes
prior to use:

  1.  TrypLE:  50mL in | 1x50mL | tubes
  2.  dPBS (for neutralising)    50mL in | 1x50mL | tubes 
  3. Growth media (for pellet resuspension):   6mL in | 1x15mL | tubes
  4.  Growth media (for Myogenic purity and Diff assay seeding   1x5.6mL + 1x1.4mL  in | 2x15mL | tubes 
  5.  Time that all aliquots were placed in the water bath to warm before use:    13:17 a/pm 

Note: if aliquots were placed in water bath at different times, record the
time stamp for each individual solution.




2\. Washed the flask(s) with dPBS.

3\. Added | 10 |mL tryple to each T175 vessel and incubated at 37ºC for | 15 |
min [13:50-14:05]

  1.  Added | 3 |mL tryple to each T75 vessel/well and incubated at 37ºC for | 15 | min [13:55-14:10]

4\. Neutralised with | 10mL (T175)/5mL (T75) | dPBS (warmed) and combined cell
suspensions for each clone into separate | 50mL | tubes. (1 tube for clone
25K6 and 2 tubes for clone 21L10.

5\. Centrifuged at 650 x g for 5 min

  1.  Start/Finish time for centrifugation was:   14:12 - 14:17 a/pm   

  2.  Start/Finish time for centrifugation was:   14:19 - 14:24 a/pm 




6\. Aspirated the supernatant(s).

7\. Resuspend pellet(s) in growth media

  * 3mL for 21L10
  * 1mL for 25K6

8\. Performed a cell count using the haemocytometer and recorded the cell
count data in the Google Doc spreadsheet called 'Cell Count Spreadsheet' (see
link below):

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1DPzKubYxfHmWogVPihC-
SSIBtIylyrBQE5kRX5Z8NtI/edit#gid=0&range=1314:1315

9\. Total cell number was: |BUFFY6_21L10 (3,828,000) BUFFY6_25K6 (372,000)  |

10\. Calculate the required volume cell suspension & freeze medium to generate
a concentration of ~1M cells/mL. (see cell counter spreadsheet link).




13\. Transferred    0.109mL   of clone 21L10 cell suspension (1.40x10^5 cells)
to the pre-warmed     5.6mL  mL Growth media:  

Removed 3x 96 well plates containing 9 gelatin coated well from the incubator
and aspirated then discarded the excess gelatin left.

Aliquoted 200uL of mixed cell suspension (~5000 cells) from step 13 above into
each of the gelatin coated wells across all three plates. Labelled the plates
1/3 - 3/3 with the tag 'Diff assay' and the date of seeding.

14\. Split the 1.4mL aliquot in half (700uL into 2x1.5mL tubes), Transferred
5uL  of  21L10 cell suspension to the pre-warmed  one tube and    16uL   of
25K6 cell suspension into the other aliquot of growth media.  

Removed 1x 96 well plates containing 6 gelatin coated well from the incubator
and aspirated then discarded the excess gelatin left.

Aliquoted 200uL of 21L10 cell suspension (containing 2000 cells) from step 14
above into wells B2-B4 on the 96 well plate and 200uL of 25K6 cell suspension
(containing 2000 cells) into wells B5-7. Labelled the plate 1/1 with the tag
'Myogenic purity assay' and the date of seeding.  

16\. Transferred vessel(s) to incubate at: [   15:18   ]

  * [x]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (avian cells)




11\. Prepared   6mL Freeze Medium: (FBS + 10% DMSO). ID #  

Stored at 4ºC until use to keep chilled.

12\. Centrifuged cells at 650 x g for 5 min.  15:22  -  15:28  a/pm

Whilst centrifuge is spinning, prepared & printed vial labels, labelled
cryovials. (Note that passage number will be the same as the culture you
harvest from. The passage number will increase by 1 during the revive of a
vial.)




13\. Aspirated supernatant carefully, taking care not to disturb the pellet.

14\. Resuspended the 21L10 pellet in | 4 |mL freeze media and the 25K6 pellet
in 0.5mL of freeze media (chilled, to reduce DMSO toxicity).

15\. Aliquotted 21L10 suspension: | 500 |µL into | 8 | x cryovials (already
labelled). Aliquotted 25K6 suspension: | 500 |µL into | 1 | x cryovials
(already labelled).

16\. Tightened the lids & transfer the cryovials to a Mr. Frosty immediately
into the -80ºC freezer.   15:54   a/pm
