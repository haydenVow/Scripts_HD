Prepare Digestion Media

DMEM, F12, Collagenase Type I 0.8 mg/mL (Worthington Biochemical Group).

15mL per biopsy needed

15 x 5 = 75mL

0.8mg/mL = 60mg in 75mL

0.06 g in 75mL DMEM/F12

  

Prepare collection media

DMEM, F12, 1X P/S

1L

10mL P/S + 495mL DMEM + 495mL F12




Prepare Digestion Media

Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium (DMEM, Gibco), Collagenase Type I 0.8 mg/mL
(Worthington Biochemical Group).

Prepare Growth media:

Hou et al.

  * F12/DMEM supplemented 
  * 200 mM•L¯¹ fetal bovine serum
  * 10 mmol•L¯¹ nicotinamide
  * 10 μg•L¯¹ EGF (epidermal growth factor)
  * 10 μg•L¯¹ insulin-transferrin-sodium selenite media supplement

  

Make 1L of growth media:

  * 790mL F12/DMEM
  * 200 mL(20%) FBS
  * 10mL (1x)P/S
  * 10uL EGF: 10 ug/L EGF (1000ug in 1000uL therefore require 10uL of solution)
  * 10ug/L of combination: Insulin, 5 μg/ml (0.05uL) , transferrin, 5 μg/ml (0.05uL), sodium selenite, 5 ng/ml (3.0 x 10-8 M) (0.05uL)

  

  1. Collect the liver (sever the portal vein and the connective tissue and separate from the body) into tube containing 15 mL of DMEM + Collagenase solution.
  2. Cut the liver sac to release the hepatocytes.
  3. Add 35 mL of DMEM and pass the liver suspension through a cell strainer (use spatula to gentle stir tissue on strainer).
  4. Spin cells at 50 x g for 1 min.
  5. Wash the pellet twice with DMEM (45 g, 1 min). The supernatant should appear clear after the last wash.
  6. Count cells with a hemocytometer, calculate viability based on Trypan Blue staining and re-suspend pelleted cells in DMEM/2% BSA at 1 million cells/mL. Spin once again at 50 g and re-suspend the cells in plating media for cell culture.
