Background  
As crocodile has been earmarked to be Vows launch product, large numbers of
CHOMP cells will be required for R&D and production in the near future. The
production team have requested a WCB of at least 400M cells to be used in the
next quarter, and additional cells will also be required for the science team.  
An MCB of F_CHOMP09 cells (Saltwater crocodile myofibroblasts) was recently
banked at Vow. See lab book here

The F_CHOMP09 cell line was derived from cells isolated following Vows
standard collagenase + dispase digestion protocol, but was performed at 30C
(appropriate for reptilian cells) instead of the standard 37C (used for
mammalian cells). Here we aim to expand F_CHOMP09 MCB cells to a WCB of > 400M
cells.  
  
A WCB of CHOMP07 cells is also being expanded. See lab book for the CHOMP07
expansion here
