Observations/Summary:

The KSR and FBS cultures were very clumpy and it was not possible to break up
all the clumps during resuspension of the cell pellet.  




Process:

  1. Observed cultures under the microscope, all were overly confluent
  2. Aliquoted reagents and placed in the cell culture incubator to warm >45 minutes prior to use: TrypLE:    20 ,Growth media (for pellet resuspension):    100   mL of each media
  3. Removed media from flasks 
  4. Washed with 10mL PBS to wash 
  5. Added 5mL Tryple to each flask and incubated at 37C for 10min 
  6. Added 5mL PBS to each flask, then transferred the mix to 50mL centrifuge tubes
  7. Centrifuged for 5 min at approx 500g. 
  8. Removed supernatant and resuspended cell pellets in 5mL of their respective growth media.
  9. Took 40ul aliquots from each tube to perform cell counts.
  10. Performed trypan blue counts for each culture and recoded in the cell count spreadsheet

  11. Reseeded each culture into 4x T175 flasks, in 30mL per flask of their respective medias.
