RELATED TO MILESTONE:  N/A, NON KR

AIM/PURPOSE: The overarching goal is to expand the Vows existing cell library
to include a broader range of species. Here, we aim to isolate and expand a
plastic adherent population of cells from crocodile muscle tissue (which we
will refer to as CHOMP cells).  

HYPOTHESES:  
1. â‰¥20 Vials of crude homogenate will be frozen down following Vows established protocols for cell isolation.  
2\. A population of plastic adherent cells will be established from the
immediate culture of macerated dermal tissue (outgrowth culture).

RESULTS SUMMARY:  
1. The hypothesis was supported. 5 biopsies were harvested and processed into 20 vials of crude homogenate.  
2\. The hypothesis was not supported. After 12 days in outgrowth culture, we
did not establish a plastic adherent cell population, and the culture was
terminated.

CONCLUSIONS:  
Crude homogenate was prepared from 5x CHOMP biopsies following Vows standard
cell isolation protocol. Our attempt to culture CHOMP adherent dermal cells
following an outgrowth culture protocol was not successful.

NEXT STEPS:  
In order to determine if the cell isolations were successful in terms of cell
viability in culture, crude homogenate will need to be thawed and cultured.

A review summarising existing literature on successful reptilian dermal
outgrowth culture should be performed. This will assist us to determine if
conditions could be altered to improved the likelihood of establishing an
adherent cell population in future attempts.  
  
There was confusion around the protocol for the cryopreservation of tissue for
proteomics and genomics. Unambiguous procedures and an SOP for tissue
cryopreservation should therefore be prepared.
