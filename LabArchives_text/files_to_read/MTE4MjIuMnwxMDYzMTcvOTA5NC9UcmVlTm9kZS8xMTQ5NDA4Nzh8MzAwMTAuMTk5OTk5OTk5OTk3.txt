Process:

Aliquoted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then
placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath > 30 minutes prior to use

  1. TrypLE:    10 mL 
  2. dPBS (for washing & neutralising)   20 mL
  3. Growth media (for pellet resuspension and seeding):    200  
  4. Washed the flask(s) with dPBS.
  5. Added    5 tryple to each vessel/well and incubated at 37˚C for     
  6. Neutralised with    5ml dPBS (warmed) and combined cell suspension into a    50ml  tubes.
  7. Centrifuged at 500 x g for 5 min.
  8. Aspirated+ discarded supernatant
  9. Resuspended pellet(s) in       3 or3mL media.  
Performed a cell count using the hemocytometer and recorded the cell count
data in widget or the Google Doc spreadsheet called 'Cell Count Spreadsheet'
(see link below):

  10. Total cell number was:  
25% Nuvonis: 4,200,000  
50% Nuvonis: 800,000

  11. Re-seeded cells as per table above.

  12. Transferred flasks to incubate at 37ºC, 5% CO2, library lab incubator #77
