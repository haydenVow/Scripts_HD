  1. Checked any "wetted" materials (materials that come into contact with the culture or additives and are therefore required to maintain sterility) for damage or residues that may introduce contamination (examples include seals and tubing).
  2. Checked any potentially dangerous equipment (e.g. gas regulators, gas lines, pressure release valves) for abnormalities that may lead to an accident.

### Results

  * Results were;
    * [ ]  As Usual (this is a repetitive task)
    * [ ]  Unexpected because...
    * [ ]  Need to be further analysed
    * [ X ]  Other (.......) Better than usual, the hydration and washing of dry cytodex was successful using a mesh covering to prevent entry of microcarriers into the harvest pipe.
