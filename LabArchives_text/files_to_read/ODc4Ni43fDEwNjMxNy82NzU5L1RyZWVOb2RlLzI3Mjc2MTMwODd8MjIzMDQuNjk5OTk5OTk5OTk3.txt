1\. Thaw the Stem Cell Qualified ECM Gel in the 2-8°C fridge one day before
use. Once thawed, maintain ECM Gel on ice at all times and use pre-cooled
medium and pipettes to avoid gelling of the product.  
  
IMPORTANT: Do not thaw ECM Gel at temperatures higher than 15ºC to avoid
gelling.  
  
2\. Dilute the ECM Gel 1:80 with cold DMEM/F12 (D6421) medium. Scale up or
down according to the volumes required. Below is an example for coating a
6-well plate with 1.5 mL of 1:80 diluted ECM Gel.  
  
• To make a 1:20 dilution, add 0.5 mL ECM Gel to 9.5 mL cold DMEM/F12 (D6421)
or DMEM (D5796) medium into a 15 mL conical tube. Total volume = 10 mL.  
• A further 4-fold dilution is required to make the final 1:80 dilution. Add
2.5 mL of 1:20 diluted ECM Gel to 7.5 mL cold DMEM/F12 medium. Total volume =
10 mL  
NOTE: The recommended dilution is 1:80, however more concentrated Stem Cell
Qualified ECM Gel may be used if desired.  
  
3\. Add 1.5 mL of the 1:80 diluted Stem Cell Qualified ECM Gel to each well of
a 6-well plate. Swirl the culture plates to spread the ECM Gel evenly across
the surface of the plate. Store in a 2 -8°C fridge overnight or at least 2
hours in the fridge before use. If not used immediately, parafilm wrap the ECM
coated culture plates and store at 2-8°C until ready to use. Use the ECM
coated culture plates within 3-4 days.  
  
4\. Prior to seeding the cells, bring the plate back to room temperature for
10-15 minutes, remove the coating solution and add 3 mL/well of human ES/iPSC
growth media. Cells can now be plated onto the newly coated plates.
