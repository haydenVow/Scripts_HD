### Process:

1\. Took image of vessel with microscope on phase setting.

2\. Gelatin coated     15     x   96-well plates (columns 5-8)  with sterile
filtered 0.1% gelatin solution and then incubated all coated flasks at 37˚C.

  1. Time when all vessels(s) placed into the incubator      11:37  am 

3\. Aliquotted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then
placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath for a minimum of 20 minutes
prior to use:

  1. TrypLE:  5 x 30mL in  5 tubes
  2. dPBS warmed at 37C (for washing):  5 x 30mL
  3. dPBS at Room Temperature (for neutralising):  5 x 30mL
  4. Growth media (for pellet resuspension):  5 x 2mL
  5. Growth media incl. 10uM p38i (for seeding):  5 x 5mL 

Time that all aliquots were placed in the water bath to warm before use
11:20  am

Note: if aliquots were placed in water bath at different time, record the time
stamp for each individual solution.

4\. Removed vessel(s) from the incubator     13:44  pm

5\. Washed the vessel(s) with dPBS (warmed).

6\. Added     10    mL tryple to each vessel/well and incubated at 37˚C.

7\. Neutralised with      10    dPBS and combined cell suspension into a    2
x 50 mL     tube.

8\. Centrifuged at 650 x g for 5 min.

  1. Start/Finish time for centrifugation was     14:25 - 14:30   pm
