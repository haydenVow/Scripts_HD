Experimental Plan:

[DAY 1] - Seed 4 (or more) x 96 well plates with 1200 cells/well in 140
uL/well

  1. Plates should be coated with gelatin on the OT2 and left in the incubator for 1 hr prior to seeding
  2. MuSCs should be seeded in growth media containing serum
  3. Please seed only columns 2-11 and put PBS in columns 1 & 12 to avoid the edge effects
  4. Label 4x 96 well plates as a designated time point: 24 h, 48 h, 72 h, and 96 h.
  5. Place plates in the incubator.

[Day 2] - 24 hours later, fix and DAPI stain one plate. On the remaining 3
plates, replace media to growth media with varying concentrations of
ingredient being tested  

  1. Use an OT2 protocol to fix & dapi, as well as to perform the 100% media change.

[Day 3] \- Fix and DAPI stain 48 h plate using the Opentrons.

[Day 4] - Fix and DAPI stain 72 h plate using the Opentrons.

[Day 5] \- Fix and DAPI stain 96h plate using the Opentrons.

  1. Parafilm the plate, wrap in foil, and leave in the fridge for 24hours before imaging for most consistent results. Do this for days 2-5. 

[Day 6] - Image 4x 96 well plates

  1. Image each well under the DAPI channel at 5x magnification using MIA capture

[Day 7] - Analysis of images

In order to process data from this assay we must:

  1. Process images using https://vowfood.retool.com/apps/Mia
  2. Copy each time point of each condition into Prism
  3. Create proliferation graph for each condition
  4. Identify doubling time for each condition
  5. Add graphs and doubling time on Notion

Acceptance criteria:

  * Proliferation graphs created for each condition
  * Doubling time for each condition
