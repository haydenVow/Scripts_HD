Nuclei Stain Protocol


Protocol for Hoescht 33342 - Live Cell Staining

1\. Calculate minimum volume of media to cover carriers when transferred to a
24 well plate (500uL / well or less)

Make up a solution of media containing Hoescht 33342 at 1ug/mL concentration.
Protect from light until required.

2\. Transfer cell laden carriers to a 24 well plate, remove excess media.

3\. Replace removed media with media containing Hoescht 33342.

4\. Incubate cell laden carriers at 37C for 10 mins on a shaker plate.

**If dye has not penetrated into the carrier, incubate for a further 5 mins.

Before images taken: Yes

Stain Used: Hoechst 33342 (ID: 8157)

Stock Concentration: 1mg/mL

Concentration used: 1ug/mL

Media used: 12540 DMEM F12 20%FBS 5%Pluronic F127  

Media added to each well: 500uL

Total media: 500uL x 12 = 6mL

Total Hoechst 33342 needed: 6ug

Culture Day: Day 1

Cell Line: CHOMP07

Carriers tested: BioNOC, Fibra Cel Discs, BioCradle L, Gelatex Microbeads

Incubation time started: 10:43

Incubation time ended: 10:58

Images taken: Yes Zaber1

Notes: Zaber 3 malfunctioned and cells were waiting in incubator for 1 hr
prior to imaging. Carriers display a fair bit of autoflorescense espoecially
the Gelatex Microbeads. Biocradle showed high cell numbers.
