Aim/Purpose


To generate a standard curve for adherent CHOMP and suspension CHO-S cells
with an alamarBlue assay and to determine the minimum number of cells detected
with this assay.


Hypothesis


That we will plot a standard curve for adherent CHOMP and suspension CHO-S
cells and that the alamarBlue assay will be sensitive enough to detect wells
with 100 cells.


Technical Gap


We have not tested alamarBlue assays to assess cell confluence at Vow, and do
not know whether the assay will be sensitive enough and/or suitable for our
purposes with single-cell cloning.


Method/Procedure


Experimental Plan

  1. D0: Thaw CHOMP fibroblasts and CHO-S cells and seed 2 x 96-wp as shown below:  

  2. D1: Add alamarBlue reagent to plates (follow manual instructions). 
    * Run on plate reader at 1H 
    * Run on plate reader at 4H 
  3. D2: Run on plate reader (1D) 
  4. D6: Run on plate reader (5D) 
  5. D8: Run on plate reader (7D) 
  6. D10: Run on plate reader (9D)
  7. D13: Run on plate reader (12D) 
  8. D15: Run on plate reader (14D)
  9. D17: Run on plate reader (16D) 
  10. Plot graphs for each plate reader run to generate standard curve and monitor how readings change over incubation periods
