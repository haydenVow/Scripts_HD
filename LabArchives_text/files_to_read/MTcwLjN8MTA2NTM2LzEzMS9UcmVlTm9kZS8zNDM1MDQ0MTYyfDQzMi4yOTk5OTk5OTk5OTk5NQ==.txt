Batch Overview

Batch Weight

23.5 g from 19 x 5CS

Achievements

  * Biggest yield per layer yet (0.242g/layer). [Batch 009 had 0.211 g/layer yield)
  * Fastest harvest yet with the use of 250mL Nunc tubes used for the first time and no cell count required (2 hrs saved). 
  * Aggregates appeared bigger than in Batch 009 - may be due to the 48 hr treatment. This was carried over to the Food team that noted the difference in initial texture and behaviour than previously. 
  * Managed a side treatment optimisation to test Vit C only treatment against a CTRL  2CF - no significant difference in yield noted. 

Deviations

  * Only 5CS were used due to delayed delivery of 10CF.
