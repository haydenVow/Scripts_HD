Process:  

  1. Aliquoted 5 mL OptiPRO + 4 mM Glutamax media into a urine jar and and placed in the water bath and warm to 37C 
  2. Collected vessels from shaker, Centrifuged for 5 min at 500 RPM
  3. Aspirated and discarded 4mL media from each tube (leaving 1mL)
  4. From this 1mL cell suspension counts were performed from. See count spreadsheet here: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1DPzKubYxfHmWogVPihC-SSIBtIylyrBQE5kRX5Z8NtI/edit#gid=0.
  5. Added additional 4 mL of media to culture .
