Background

Here we aim to culture and expand a plastic adherent population of of CHOMP
raw homogenate following optimised protocols based upon the findings in our
previous CHOMP cell isolation and culture attempts. See lab books here:

Our most recent observations were taken on 23/08/21, and the findings to date
are listed bellow. See lab book here:https://au-

Key Points

  1. Collagenase II + Dispase digestion of CHOMP09 biopsies was successful in isolating adherent cells when performed at 30C.
  2. Trypsin digestion of CHOMP07 biopsies was successful in isolating adherent cells when performed at 30C.
  3. Culture at 30C was far superior in supporting adherent cell proliferation than culture at 37C.
  4.  Samples digested with Collagenase II + Dispase at 37C appeared senescent by day 10. As these samples were only cultured at 37C, it is unclear if these cultures failed due to the increased digestion temperature or higher culture temperature. 
  5. CHOMP cells took a minimum of 6 days in culture to become fully attached to culture plastic.
  6. Once attached to culture plastic, CHOMP cells are able to proliferate under in both DMEM/F12 + 20% FBS +1x P/S and M199 \+ 20% FBS +1x P/S when cultured at 30C and 5% CO2.
  7. At the time of our most recent observation (23/08/21), our culture containing CHOMP09 digested with Collagenase II + Dispase at 30C, cultured in DMEM/F12 + 20% FBS +1x P/S  contained the most adherent cells. 

Given these findings, a vial of CHOMP9 (30C collagenase digested) will be
thawed for further expansion. As we have seen that CHOMP cells take longer to
attached to plastic than our mammalian cells, we will increase the time
between seeding and 1st feed to allow cells do attach. Cells will be cultured
in DMEM/F12 + 20% FBS and 1x P/S at 30C and 5% CO2.
