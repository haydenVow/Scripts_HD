Growth Media:

DMEM/F12 + 20% FBS + 1X P/S + 1:100 Anti-clumping agent + RGD peptide  
DMEM/F12 + 20% FBS + 1X P/S + 1:100 Anti-clumping agent + YIGSR peptide

### Process:

1\. Took image of vessel with microscope on phase setting.

3\. Aliquotted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then
placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath for a minimum of 20 minutes
prior to use:

  1. TrypLE:      100  mL in     1    tubes
  2.  dPBS (for washing and neutralising):     200  mL in   2x    tubes
  3. Growth media (for pellet resuspension):     20    mL in     1    tubes
  4. Growth media (for seeding):     10     mL of each growth media in   1 tubes  

Time that all aliquots were placed in the water bath the warm before use   14
:00  

Note: if aliquots were placed in water bath at different time, record the time
stamp for each individual solution.




4\. Removed vessel(s) from the incubator   16:40  

5\. Washed the vessel(s) with dPBS (warmed).

6\. Added    100    mL tryple to each vessel/well and incubated at 37˚C.

  1. Start/Finish for TrypLE was   16:45   

7\. Neutralised with    100     dPBS and combined cell suspension into a    4x
50ml tubes  

8\. Centrifuged at 650 x g for 5 min.

  1. Start/Finish time for centrifugation was    17:15-17:20  




9\. Aspirated the supernatant(s).

10\. Resuspended pellet(s) in   20    mL    Growth  media  

11\. Aliquoted  100ul    of resuspended cells into a microcentrifuge tube for
cell count.

12\. Performed a cell count using the haemocytometer and recorded the cell
count data in the Google Doc spreadsheet called 'Cell Count Spreadsheet' (see
link below):

SSIBtIylyrBQE5kRX5Z8NtI/edit#gid=0

  1.  Total cell number was:     40.5M       

  2. Volume of cell suspension required for subculture was:  entire cell count  

  3. Volume of cell suspension required for subculture was:      5ml per sample
  4. Cell sheet experiment Lab book https://au-mynotebook.labarchives.com/share/Vow%2520-%2520Team%2520Science/MTg4Ny42MDAwMDAwMDAwMDAxfDEwNjMxNy8xNDUyLTkzOTUvVHJlZU5vZGUvMzY3MjU5NzczNnw0NzkxLjU5OTk5OTk5OTk5OQ==  

  

Seeding Day:  
For suspension experiment

  1. Aliquot 10.1M cells into 4 x 50mL shake tubes.
  2. Centrifuge at 5x tubes 650 x g for 5 min at RT.
  3. Aspirate supernatant carefully
  4. Resuspend each pellet in 1mL of the respective Growth Media with a P1000 to break up the cells
  5. Add the remaining 9mL of respective Growth Media with a 10mL serological pipette to disperse cells evenly throughout the suspension
  6. Transfer tubes to shake at 206 RPM at 37ºC, 5% CO2. 17:55
