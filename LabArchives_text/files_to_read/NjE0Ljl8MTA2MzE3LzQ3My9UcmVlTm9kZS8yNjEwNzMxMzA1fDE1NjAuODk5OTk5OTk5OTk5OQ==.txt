to 50% feed.  
  
  
  




Growth Media:

  * [ ]  DMEM + 10% HS + 1X P/S
  * [ ]  DMEM + 10% HS + 1X P/S + 25ng/mL FGF-basic + P38i (10uM)
  * [ ]  DMEM + 10% HS + 1X P/S + 25ng/mL FGF-basic
  * [ ]  DMEM + 10% HS + 1X P/S + P38i (10uM)
  * [ ]  DMEM + 10% FBS + 1X P/S
  * [ ]  DMEM + 20% FBS + 1X P/S
  * [ ]  DMEM/F12 + 10% FBS + 1X P/S
  * [ ]  DMEM/F12 + 20% FBS + 1X P/S
  * [ ]  DMEM/F12 + 20% FBS + 1X P/S + 25ng/mL FGF-basic
  * [x]  DMEM/F12 + 20% FBS + 1X P/S + P38i (10uM)
  * [ ]  DMEM/F12 + 20% FBS + 1X P/S + 25ng/mL FGF-basic + P38i (10uM)

Total media required: 150 mL

Total p38i required: 75 uL




Reagent preperation

1\. Place pre-aliquotted  150 mL  mL of  Growth Media in   1x 250 mL  pot into
water bath to be warmed. Placed in water bath   11:40 am




Cell factory Process

  1. Unscrew white cap and remove blue cap and place aside.
  2. Removed  `50`  % of supernatant (150 mL) from 1 x 2CF by carefully pouring into a waste container with 150mL marked.
  3. Replaced with  `150` mL (per flask) of  `growth`   media by carefully pouring media through the white cap opening (alternatively you may use a 50mL serological to add media.)
  4. Place caps back and equalise 2CF by placing it on its side (blue cap on the bottom and white cap on the top, see image below:)  
  

4\. Returned vessel to incubate at:

  * [x]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (aviary cells)

  

  * [x]  Thermo Incubator (ID #13)
  * [ ]  Top Sanyo Incubator (ID #25)
  * [ ]  Bottom Sanyo Incubator
  * [ ]  Top Binder Incubator
  * [ ]  Bottom Binder Incubator
