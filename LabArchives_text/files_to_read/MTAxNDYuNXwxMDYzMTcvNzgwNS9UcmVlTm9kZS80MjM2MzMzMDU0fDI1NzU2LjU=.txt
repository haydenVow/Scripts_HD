 ~~Using a sharp knife, expose the muscle and spine region of the shark~~

  
Instruments that were attempted but were discovered they do not cleanly cut/
cannot cut shark skin: scalpel (no. 22), dissection scissors.  
  
  
Thick dissection scissors (large) work very efficiently to cut shark skin.
Order several more  
24Expose the muscle and spine region of the shark.Using small forceps in the
left-hand pinch down on the edge of the sharkskin at the opening of the cross-
section.  
  
In the right hand using large dissection scissors, create slow sharp
dissections starting proximal to the shark tail, going vertical distally
towards the end of the tail until clean dissections cannot be achieved.  
JD  11: 53Repeat the findings described to access deep sterile tissue more
efficiently  
  
Perform 'training' biopsies to ensure we are accessing sterile tissue in the
most efficient manner possible.  
  
This step needs to be demonstrated in-person to be best understood by a new
biopsy learner.  
25430-Raw-BRUCE08-10062Lift skin away from the muscle beneath Lift skin off
shark and in right hand with a sterile scalp do horizontal cuts to skin the
skin off the muscle (RIGHT SIDE OF SHARK).  
  
NOTE: cuts with a scalpel are cut facing away from body and left hand is not
in the direction of the scalpel cutting angle.  
  
 11: 55 This step needs to be demonstrated in-person to be best understood by
a new biopsy learner.  
  
purchase muscle forceps  
  
It is observed that the skin cannot be pulled away from the vertebrae when
laterally from the muscle tissue on the RHS and moving to the LHS.  
  
 11: 55  refer to the observations column  
26Another dissection with the large scissors is conducted on the left side of
the shark.Vertebrae column posterior spinous process is attached very close to
the skin all the way to the end of the tail.  
  
This suggests we cannot access vertebral cartilage/ tissue from the surface
and should access vertebrae laterally.  
  
 11: 57  refer to the observations column

 ~~Perform serial washes  ~~

  *  ~~Drop PBS with anti/anti (with a 10mL syringe) on the surface of the tissue exposed to prevent it from drying out.~~
  *  ~~Drop in a falcon tube filled with 70% ethanol. (repetition 1) rapidly~~
  *  ~~Drop in a falcon tube filled with 70% ethanol. (repetition 2) rapidly  ~~
  *  ~~Drop in a falcon tube filled with 70% ethanol. (repetition 3) rapidly  ~~

Preliminary findings suggest these steps compromise cell viability  
  
  
  
  
28Cutaway muscle to get the spine as close as possible.Use small dissection
scissors and scalpels.  
  
With a scalpel, you can feel when the bone is touched. NOTE: any time

  1. Transfer biopsy tissue into a falcon tube with 5mL of Wash with Shark wash media. and leave for 5 minutes
  2.  Transfer biopsy tissue into a falcon tube with 5mL of Wash with Shark wash media
  3. Transfer biopsy tissue into a falcon tube with 5mL of Wash with Shark PBS.
  4. Transfer to a dry 100mm culture plate. 
  5.  5mL of DIGESTION media was added to the plate and mincing with 2x scapels was performed (no. 22 type blade) for 10 minutes minimum.
    1. `note next time add 1mL at a time to the plate until the the tissue is only soaked to avoid adding too much liquid and which makes it difficult to mince.   
`

  6. ~~Media was slowly (~5mL) added to the minced tissue to keep the tissue just hydrated.  ~~note, this step was not done as 5mL was more than sufficent to mince the tissue
  7. The tissue was adequately minced into 1mm pieces. 

Initiate ~~Serial  ~~Single long term (20hr) Digestion Stage:

  1. Calculate the volume of digestion media needed for the tissue mass used.  
  2. Transfer the minced tissue from the petri dishes into a 50ml falcon tube containing 5mL Digest Media (LDF basal media + Collagenase 8mg/mL, where we are using 10mL of digestion media per gram of tissue).
  3. Incubate for 20 hours, at 26°C with optional agitation in the water bath. 10:40am   

  4. Add 10mL wash media to the biopsy tubes.
  5. Centrifuge tube at 500 x g for 5 min. 16:40-45
  6. Aspirate 12mL of supernatant
  7. Add 10mL of Wash media. 
  8. Centrifuge tube at 500 x g for 5 min. 17:02
  9. Aspirate supernatant from the pellet, very gently to avoid disturbing pellet

Leave the reagents at room temp for a minimum of 30 minutes before use

taken out of fridge at 10: 30

  1. Resuspend in 10mL of Wash Media 
  2. I ~~f the tissue is well digested, triturate through a 10mL serological pipette.  
If there are still muscle chunks, using a 10ml syringe and 20-gauge needle,
aspirate and eject the muscle suspension in and out of the syringe 10x.  
CRITICAL STEP: The needle may be clogged by small pieces of tendon or
undigested tissue during the first few attempts. If clogging occurs during
trituration, remove the clog from the tip of the needle. If clogging occurs
during ejection, pull the plunger up and down to move the clog out of
position. Eject towards the wall of the tube (as opposed to the bottom) to
avoid foaming.~~

  3.  ~~Fill tube to 50 ml with wash media. Gently invert a few times to mix.~~
  4.  ~~Centrifuge at 500 x g for 5 min.    ~~ ~~   : a/pm  ~~
  5.  ~~Aspirate supernatant down to about 10 mL.~~
  6. Place a ~~50  ~~40-μm Nylon cell strainer on a fresh 50 mL conical tube.
  7.  ~~Resuspend the pellet with a 10 mL pipette.  ~~
  8. Transfer to the cell strainer and allow to filter by gravity.
  9. Add 10 mL wash media to the original tube. Swirl to rinse, and transfer to the same cell strainer.
  10. Rinse the cell strainer with another 10 mL WM. Use a 20-200 μl pipet to collect any remaining liquid on the underside of the strainer.
  11. Divide the ~30ml cell suspension equally across into 3 x 15mL tubes
  12. Centrifuge all 3x falcon tubes at 500 x g for 5 min.  17:30 
  13. Remove all supernatant by aspiration immediately after centrifugation as the pellet will loosen over time! Be very careful not to aspirate cells from the pellet. 

Seeding Stage:

  1. Resuspend the cell suspension in each tube with 3mL of respective media (each tube will either be growth medium 1, 2, or 3).
  2. Seed the cells into their respective plating conditions. 
    1. For GM 1 falcon tube of cell suspension, seed 3mL of cells (per well) into 3 wells (1x un-coated, 1x collagen coated, 1x gelatin coated)

    3. For GM 3 falcon tube of cell suspension, seed 3mL of cells (per well) into 3 wells (1x un-coated, 1x collagen coated, 1x gelatin coated) 
  3. Place in incubator at 26°C, 5% CO2 for 3-18 hours (parafilmed around the edges)    17:45
  4.  ~~After 3-18 hours, add 1.5mL of growth medium~~
  5.  ~~Place in incubator at 26 °C, 5% CO2 (parafilmed around the edges)     17:  a/pm ~~
  6. Refeed the cultures every 3 days with 50% feeds.
