Prepare materials for thaw and seed:

2\. Aliquotted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then
placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath for a minimum of 20 minutes
prior to use:

  *  Growth media (for seeding):  40  mL in 1   tubes 
  * Time that aliquot was placed in the water bath to warm before use:   10:35

## Thaw and seed vial:

3\. Collected the cryovial from Liquid Nitrogen storage & place in foam
floater in water bath for 5 min  14:50 - 14:55

Location where cryovial was collected from:

Vial details:  1   x fibroblas   cryovials at   1M  cells each for a total of
1M cells

Brew

Tower/Bucket # 1

Box/Cane # 2

Vial location: A8  

Vial ID(s):2287-Culture-6303-Vial-8of115

`4. Ethanol sprayed & transferred the vial(s) to the BSC.`

`5.  Added  500µL of Growth Media (to generate a total volume of 1mL in the
cryovial) to the cryovial, resuspended the cell suspension gently to reduce
osmotic shock. `

`6. Collected the entire 1mL of cell suspension & transfer into 7mL pre-warmed
tube of Growth Media in 15mL tube. `

`7. Centrifuged at 650 x g for 5 min.`

`8. Removed supernatant `````  

`7. Resuspended & distributed the cells evenly in the   30mL of pre-warmed
Growth Media.  
`

`8. Transfered  30 mL to    T175 flask/well, allow to rest in the BSC at RT
for 30 min 15:15 `

`9. Transfered flask/plate(s) to incubate at: `

  * [x ]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (aviary cells)

  

Making labels

Note - You will need to increase the passage number by one. (i.e. if your
thawed vial ID has a passage number of 3, when you make a culture ID for you
vessel you will need change the passage number to 4 on Airtable.)

Summary:

  




### Results:

  * Results were;
    * [ ]  As Usual (this is a repetitive task)
    * [ ]  Unexpected because...
    * [ ]  Need to be further analysed
    * [ x]  Other (.......)

To avoid needing to change media tomorrow, cells were spun down to remove DMSO
and resuspended in fresh growth media for seeding.
