  1. Prepare one T175 (or T150) flask containing 100mlSFM pre-equilibrated to 37°C. 1pm
  2. Equilibrate flask for at least 2min an incubator at 37°C, 5% CO2 and 95% relative humidity
  3. Quickly  thaw  one  vial quail cells  in  the  37°C  water  bath. Do  not  immerse  the  vial completely, only about 2/3, to keep the top of the vial out of the water. Take care to remove the  vial  from  the  water  bath immediately  when the  cells  are thawed. Ideally, a small ice clump(approximately 5 mm)is still visible. 17:00
  4. Clean vial with 70% ethanol.
  5. Transfer  it  to  the bio-safety  cabinet. Gently  tap  the  vial  a  few  times  to  resuspend  the  cells. Using  a 1000 μl single channel pipette with a filter tip transfer the content of the tube to the T175 flask containing 100 ml of SFM previously equilibrated to 37°C. Tilt the flask several times to evenly distribute the cells.Note: Do not mix the cells in the vial by pipetting. 
  6. Incubateat 37°C, 5% CO2, 95% relative humidity
