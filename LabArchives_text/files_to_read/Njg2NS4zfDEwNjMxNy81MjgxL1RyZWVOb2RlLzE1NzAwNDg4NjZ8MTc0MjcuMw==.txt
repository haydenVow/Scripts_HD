Experimental Plan

Dermal outgrowth culture  
A sample of dermal tissue, approximately 2cm2 should be collected at the time
of biopsy. Once inside the lab and in a BSC, the tissue will be macerated with
a sterile scalpel and forceps, and immediately placed in a single well of a
6-well plate, with enough growth media  to cover the tissue (approx. 1mL). The
following day, media should be topped up to 3mL.  This culture should be
monitored daily, with 50% media changes performed approximately every 72hrs.
Once cells reach 70% confluence, they should be passaged and continually
expanded until they reach sufficient numbers to form an MCB (>8M cells)

The growth media used for this culture will be M199 + 15% FBS + 20ng/mL EGF,
based on the previous success of Hyndman, T.H., et al who cultured crocodile
fibroblasts in this media [1].

Processing of biopsied tissue into crude homogenate  
5x biopsies of approximately 5g in size will be collected from the crocodile
limbs. Biopsied tissue will be processed into crude homogenate following Vows
previously established collagenase +dispase digestion protocols for primary
cell isolation. The homogenate from each biopsy will be split into 4, and
cryopreserved for culture and expansion at a later date.

Preservation of tissue for histology and proteomics/genomics.  
As is standard practice at Vow, additional tissue will be collected at the
time of biopsy, which will immediately be cryopreserved for future analysis by
proteomics/genomics and histology.
