Prepare materials for thaw and seed:

2\. Aliquotted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then
placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath for a minimum of 20 minutes
prior to use:

  *  Growth media (for seeding):    30 mL 
  * Time that aliquot was placed in the water bath to warm before use:  15:20 pm 

  




## Thaw and seed vial:

3\. Collected the cryovial from Liquid Nitrogen storage & place in foam
floater in water bath for 5 min  `15:46 - 15:51 pm`  

Location where cryovial was collected from:

Vial details:  1   x  F_DOLLY12  cryovials at  1M  cells each for a total of
1M  cells

Brew

Tower/Bucket 5  

Box/Cane 3  

Vial location: D3  

Vial ID(s): 3405  

`4. Ethanol sprayed & transferred the vial(s) to the BSC.`

`5.  Added  200 µL of Growth Media (to generate a total volume of 1.2mL in the
cryovial) to the cryovial, resuspended the cell suspension gently to reduce
osmotic shock. `

`6. Collected the entire 1.2mL of cell suspension & transfer into the pre-
warmed tube of Growth Media. `

`7. Using a 25mL serological pipette, resuspended & distributed the cells
evenly in the  30 mL of pre-warmed Growth Media (prepared in Step 2). `

`8. Transfered  30 mL to the  T175  flask `

`9. Transfered flask/plate(s) to incubate at:  15:56 pm`

  * [ X]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (aviary cells)
