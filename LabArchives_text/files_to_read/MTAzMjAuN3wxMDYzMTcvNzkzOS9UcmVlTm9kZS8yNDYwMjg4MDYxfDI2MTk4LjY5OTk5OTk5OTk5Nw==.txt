If the muscle is well digested, triturate through a 10mL serological pipette.

If there are still muscle chunks, using a 10ml syring and 20-gauge needle,
aspirate and eject the muscle suspension in and out of the syringe 10x.

CRITICAL STEP: The needle may be clogged by small pieces of tendon or
undigested muscle during the first few attempts. If clogging occurs during
trituration, remove the clog from the tip of the needle. If clogging occurs
during ejection, pull the plunger up and down to move the clog out of
position. Eject towards the wall of the tube (as opposed to the bottom) to
avoid foaming.

Place a 40-μm Nylon cell strainer on a fresh 50 mL conical tube.

  
  
  
  
  
  
Resuspend the pellet with a 10 mL pipette. Transfer to the cell strainer and
allow to filter by gravity.

  
  
  
  
  
  
Add 10 mL WM to the original tube. Swirl to rinse, and transfer to the same

Rinse the cell strainer with another 10 mL WM. Use a 20-200 μl pipet to
collect any remaining liquid on the underside of the strainer. CRITICAL STEP:
Make sure to collect everything that remains associated with the outside and
underside of the strainer after filtration to maximize yield.

  
  
  
  
  
  
  
Fill each tube to 50 mL with WM. Gently invert a few times to mix.

Remove all supernatant by aspiration immediately after centrifugation as the
pellet will loosen over time! Be very careful not to aspirate cells from the
pellet!

Culture the isolate

Note: The homogenate from each biopsy should be split into 4 equal portions. 3
of the portions should be frozen immediately as raw homogenate, while the 4th
potion is placed into immediate culture.  

  1. Placed xxxx of xxxx media in the water bath at 37C and warmed for at least 20min  timestamp   

  2. Took the falcon tubes containing 1/4 of the crude homogenate from each biopsy from the centrifuge (see section above) and resuspend in 3mL of pre-warmed growth media per tube. 
  3. Transfered to 1x well of a 6-well plate (use a separate plate for each biopsy) 
  4. Parafilmed plates to avoid possible contamination leak into the incubator
  5. Incubated at 37C and 50% CO2, Library Lab incubator timestamp

Freeze Isolate

After isolation, Froze the remaining homogenate portions.  

  1. Aspirated supernatant from each pellet
  2. Resuspend each pellet in 2mL Freeze Media
  3. Aliquoted 4 x 500uL aliquots into pre-labelled cryovials.
  4. Transfered vials immediately to a Mr Frosty and into the -80C freezer     timestamp
