Growth Media (for resuspension):

  * [ ]  DMEM/F12 + 20% FBS + 1X P/S + VEGF + EGF + FGF + IGF




Process:

 1\. Aliquotted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and
then placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath for a minimum of 20 minutes
prior to use:

  1.  TrypLE:  10 mL in | 1 | tubes
  2.  dPBS (for neutralising)   10 mL in | 1 | tubes 
  3.  Growth media (for pellet resuspension):  2 mL in | 1 | tubes 
  4.  Time that all aliquots were placed in the water bath to warm before use:  11:08 am 

Note: if aliquots were placed in water bath at different times, record the
time stamp for each individual solution.

2\. Washed the flask with dPBS.

3\. Added | 10 |mL tryple to each the flask and incubated at 37ºC for | 10-15
| min  | 11:22 - 11:39 am |  
Note* checked at 11:30 and 11:36 and still >20% cells attached

4\. Neutralised with | 10 | dPBS (RT) and combined cell suspension into a |
50mL | tube.

5\. Centrifuged at 650 x g for 5 min

  1.  Start/Finish time for centrifugation was:   11:42 - 11:47 am   




6\. Aspirated the supernatant(s).

7\. Resuspend pellet(s) in | 2 |mL | Endothelial Cell Growth | media.

8\. Performed a cell count using the haemocytometer and recorded the cell
count data in the Google Doc spreadsheet called 'Cell Count Spreadsheet' (see
link below):

SSIBtIylyrBQE5kRX5Z8NtI/edit#gid=0

9\. Total cell number was: | 224K cells |

10\. Calculate the required volume cell suspension & freeze medium to generate
a concentration of ~1M cells/mL.




11\. Prepared  2 mL Freeze Medium: (FBS + 10% DMSO). ID # 4857  

Stored at 4ºC until use to keep chilled.

12\. Centrifuged cells at 650 x g for 5 min.  12:00  \-  12:05 pm

Whilst centrifuge is spinning, prepared & printed vial labels, labelled
cryovials. (Note that passage number will be the same as the culture you
harvest from. The passage number will increase by 1 during the revive of a
vial.)




13\. Aspirated supernatant carefully, taking care not to disturb the pellet.

14\. Resuspended the pellet in | 0.5 |mL freeze media (chilled, to reduce DMSO
toxicity).

15\. Aliquotted | 500 |µL into | 1 | x cryovial (already labelled).

16\. Tightened the lids & transfer the cryovials to a Mr. Frosty immediately
into the -80ºC freezer.   12:07 pm

  * [ ]  Without foam
  * [ ]  1st Freeze
  * [X ]  2nd Freeze
  * [ ]  3rd Freeze
  * [ ]  4th Freeze
  * [ ]  5th Freeze

17\. Allow the cells to freeze for at least 18-24 hours before transferring to
Liquid Nitrogen storage.

Observations/Summary:

\- 1 X Vial of CD31+ cells frozen at -80C.

Number of cells expected was higher (hoping for >1M cells), however 224K cells
total was yielded. The cells are very large and difficult to count on the
hemocytometer which may have resulted in slightly innacurate counting, however
total cell numbers were still very low considering the size of the cells and
confluence of flask (see images above).

  

These cells will need to be revived, characterised (IF staining for CD31
and/or other endothelial cell markers) and expanded to assess suitability for
Vow.

  




SOPs used:

  * SOP_Banking Adherent cells V_03

  




### Results:

  * Results were;
    * [ ]  As Usual (this is a repetitive task)
    * [ X]  Unexpected because less cells were harvested than expected.
    * [ ]  Need to be further analysed
    * [ ]  Other (.......)
