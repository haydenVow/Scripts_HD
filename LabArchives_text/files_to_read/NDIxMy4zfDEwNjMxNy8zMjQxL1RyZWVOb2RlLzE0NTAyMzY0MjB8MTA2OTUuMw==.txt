### DID NOT PERFORM PASSAGE. see observation section below

###  

### Process:

1\. Took image of vessel with microscope on phase setting.

2\. Gelatin coated    1      x    4CF   and 1 x 2CF   vessel  with sterile
filtered 0.1% gelatin solution and then incubated all coated flasks at 37˚C.
(Note there should already be flask coated in the fridge )

  1. Time when all vessels(s) placed into the incubator       9: 22  am 

3\. Aliquotted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then
placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath for a minimum of 20 minutes
prior to use:

  1. TrypLE:      70   mL 
  2.  dPBS (At 37 degrees for washing):     70    mL 
  3.  dPBS (at RT neutralising):    70     mL
  4. Growth media (for pellet resuspension):     7    mL in         tubes
  5. Growth media (for seeding):      1000   mL in         tubes

Time that all aliquots were placed in the water bath the warm before use     :
a/pm

Note: if aliquots were placed in water bath at different time, record the time
stamp for each individual solution.




4\. Removed vessel(s) from the incubator     :   a/pm

5\. Washed the vessel(s) with dPBS (warmed).

6\. Added     10    mL tryple to each vessel/well and incubated at 37˚C.

  1. Start/Finish for TrypLE was     :   a/pm 

7\. Neutralised with     10     dPBS and combined cell suspension into a
tube.

8\. Centrifuged at 650 x g for 5 min.

  1. Start/Finish time for centrifugation was     :   a/pm 




9\. Aspirated the supernatant(s).

10\. Resuspended pellet(s) in         mL          media     :   a/pm

11\. Aliquoted          of resuspended cells into a microcentrifuge tube for
cell count.

12\. Performed a cell count using the haemocytometer and recorded counts in
"Seed Calculator" widget (see below):




13\. Transferred           µl of cell suspension to the pre-warmed
mL Growth media:      :    a/pm

14\. Transferred cell suspension into the             pre-gelatin coated
vessel.

15\. Left at RT in the BSC for 30 min to allow cells to settle      :  \-  :
a/pm  

16\. Transferred vessel(s) to incubate at:

  * [x]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells) thermo incubator
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (avian cells)

Observations/Summary:

Did not see many cells observed in the 7 x T175. Saw a few dead cells floating
in the flask. It is expected that majority of the cells were dead or did not
attached during the thaw. On Wednesday during the 100% media change, majority
of the dead cells (round cells held in suspension) would have been removed.
However, Kylie did not take images of the flask that day and only performed
the feed so therefore we can only assume that this was the case.

Version Change Log

NameChange Details  
V1 (original)N/A  
V2Changed all sentences to past tense to better reflect a hand-written lab
book entry.  
Various formatting changes.  
Addition of more detail to step 2, removal of step 3. Replaced volume
requirements table with updated volumes @Sep 22, 2020  
Updated temperature selection for mammalian/aviary cells @Sep 23, 2020  
V3Included a section for 'vessel type' in passage ID table Replace
'flask/plate' with 'vessel' throughout lab book Include at step 1 to take
image of vessel on the microscope  
Mentioned that dPBS for washing should be warm - step 3(2) and 5.  
Added timepoint at step 4 for when vessel is removed from incubator  
Include at step 11 to aliquot cell resuspension into microcentrifuge tube  
Included at step 10 and 13 time point for when cell pellet is resuspended and
when resuspended cells is moved into growth media.  
Included p38i in table of regent used  
Combined two dPBS entries in 'Media/reagents' table Added 'cell density per
vessel'
