Process:

*You will need an extra P300 pipette box or two in the BSC for this feed*  

  1. Place the media reservoir in thermo to warm up media for a minimum of 20 minutes  10:56 - ~11:50  
  2. Briefly spin the 96 deep-well plates down in the centrifuge to collect all the media. 20 seconds at 800g is appropriate. ~12:00
  3. Removed   100 % of supernatant from vessel. Change tips for each column.
  4. Replaced with   140uL (per well/per vessel) of   DSD  media. E.g. Column B on the media block corresponds to column B on the plate.  Change tips for each column.
  5. Returned vessel to incubate at: 12:31

  * [X]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (aviary cells)

Please re-foil plates when done with the feed :) Thanks!
