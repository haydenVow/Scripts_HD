As seen previously, these cells do not have a typical fibroblast morphology.
They have enlarged cytoplasm and for triangular shapes without the elongated
projections seen in fibroblasts. They appear to have increase slightly in
number since the last observation.

At first I thought these cells had proliferated due to apparent increase in
confluence. In actuality though, I believe the cytoplasm have become even
larger and spead out, covering a larger surface are.
