### Process:

1\. Zaber scanned vessel (5x,Phase)

3\. Aliquotted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then
placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath for a minimum of 20 minutes
prior to use:

  1. TrypLE:     500 uL    in      1   tubes
  2.  dPBS (for washing):    1     mL
  3. Growth media (for seeding):     3    mL in 1 well of 6 wp warmed in incubator  

Time that all aliquots were placed in the water bath the warm before use   10
: 47 - 11:18  

Note: if aliquots were placed in water bath at different time, record the time
stamp for each individual solution.




4\. Removed vessel(s) from the incubator    11 : 18  

5\. Washed the vessel(s) with 500uL dPBS (warmed).

6\. Added    0.2     mL tryple to each vessel/well and incubated at 37˚C.

  1. Start/Finish for TrypLE was    11 :21 - 11:36  




13\. Transferred   700uL of growth media from the destination well to the well
being passaged. Mixed the cell suspension up and down. Transferred this to the
6 well plate.

16\. Transferred vessel(s) to incubate at: 11:40

  * [X]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (avian cells)
