PROCESS:

1\. Harvest cells

2\. Count cells with trypan blue and record the following for each flask
(repeat counts 3x per flask):

Total number of cells =

Number of dead cells =  
  
3\. Combine cell pellets for each condition  
  
4\. Remove 50,000 cells for each condition for Bradford assay (note - need to
leave 2M cells for ELISA, if have plenty of cells then remove 50,000 or more
for bradford, 30000 is the min)  
  
5\. Wash remaining pellets 3x with ice cold PBS.

4\. Freeze remaining pellet at -80C until analysis by ELISA.

## Reagent preparation:

  1. Aliquot reagents following the table below: 

Note: Tryple needs to be completely warm before using otherwise cells will not
detach

## Image flask

  1. Observed flask under the microscope at 4x or 5x objective for even cell distribution and < 50% confluency. Refer to VSOP006_0
  2. Took at least 3 images per flask and returned flask back to incubator.

  




## Harvest

  1. Transfer flask and aliquots into BSC, ensuring to wipe down containers with 70% EtOH during the transfer.   
  2. Discarded growth media from each flask 
  3. Washed with warmed dPBS, then discarded. (for cell factory equalised and gently swirled flask

  




  1. Added TrypLE to each of the flasks. Swirled flask thoroughly to ensure coverage of the surface area.
  2. Placed in the incubator at 37C.
  3. After 5 minutes, swirled flask again to ensure all surfaces are covered.
  4. After 10 minute, removed flasks and observed for 95-100% dissociation of cells. Incubated further if needed until maximum dissociation level is reached.

  1. Collected TrypLE solution into 225mL centrifuge tubes
  2. Wash flask with ambient temperature dPBS and transferred into centrifuge tube. 
  3. Centrifuged at 650 x g for 5 minutes.

  1. Gently removed centrifuge tubes from the machine, ensuring not to disturb the suspended pellets. Aspirated the supernatant from the tubes, prioritising those with cells first *. Discarded supernatant. Removed remaining supernatant with a 1mL pipette.
  2. Resuspend the pellet in 1 mL of growth media at a time. Pooled into one tube. Washed tubes labeled with * with remaining growth media by transferring media from one tube to the next.
  3. Measure the total volume of the cell resuspension using a serological. Total resuspension volume =
  4. Using the same serological, pipette mix cell suspension to ensure a homegenous cell suspension is obtained. 
  5. Immediately aliquot 2 x    uL  of cell resuspension into cell count tubes. Volume of cell suspension is below:  

  




  1. Triturated the obtained cell suspension 10 times (careful not to make bubbles) and transfer into trypan blue.
  2. Triturated the cells suspended in trypan blue at least 10 times (careful not to make bubbles) and transfer 10 uL onto haemocytometer.
  3. Performed cell count and enter details into "Seed Calculator" (see below).
