Reagent preparation:

3\. Prepared Secondary Antibody mix (pipette from the top/supernatant of
antibody solution):

  15 µL   Secondary #1   (1:1000  ) +  15 µL   Secondary #2   (1:1000  ) +  15
mL Blocking Buffer (PBST (0.1% Triton X + dPBS) + 3% BSA)  

If using AlexaFluor secondary antibodies then the max concentration should be
1:500 (typically used at 1:1000)

Pipette-mixed antibody mix and stored refrigerated away from light until
needed.

4\. Prepared DAPI mix:

   15 mL  PBS +    15 uL  of DAPI

Vortexed DAPI mix and stored refrigerated away from light until needed.

Process:

1\. Removed plate from fridge (incubated in primary antibodies overnight).

2\. Washed 3 times for 5 min with PBS at RT.

 12:55 - 1:00 pm

 1:01 - 1:06 pm

 1:07 - 1:12 pm

3\. Incubated the cells with secondary antibody mixture in the dark at RT for
1 hour.  1:15 - 2:15 pm

NOTE: from this step onwards protect from the light by wrapping plates in foil
and perform experiment in the dark.




Counter staining

1\.  Removed 2nd antibody solution.  14:16 pm

2\.  Washed with DAPI (1:1000) in PBS for 5 min at RT in the dark.

 14:23 - 14:28 pm

3\.  Washed in PBS 3 x 5 min at RT in the dark. (No Triton)

 14:28 - 14:33 pm

 14:33 - 14:38 pm

4\.  Replaced dPBS.

 14:40 pm

5\. Confirmed staining on microscope by imaging.
