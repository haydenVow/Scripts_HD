50% Feed on 9x10CF and 1x4CF


TERMINATED DUE TO CONTAMINATION (AFTER THE FEED HAD ALREADY BEEN PERFORMED)

Due to a widespread contamination throughout the laboratory, flasks were
observed carefully under 40x magnification to identify for possible
contamination. Spindle-like structures were found in only observable flask
(1x4CF), indicating potential fungal growth within the cultures. It was
therefore decided to discard the flasks due to the high risk of low level
contamination in all of the flasks. See images of spindle structure below:






# Procedure - Feed

# Note: Fibroblasts do NOT require Gelatin coated Flasks, and do NOT require
p38i.  

  1. Turn on the water bath and set to 37'C.
  2. Aliquot  required growth media into a sterile container/s and place into the water bath. 
  3. Place in the water bath and heat for at least 20 minutes.
  4. Observe the cell flasks for confluence under the microscope using 4 x magnification and take images as required. Note: The confluence of cells must be <50% to perform cell feeding in P1-P3 and <80% in P4 prior to the cell differentiation stage. 
  5. Transfer flasks to the BSC and remove required volume of media from each flask (according to the Table below).
  6. Replace the same volume into each flask with the prepared growth media.
  7. Return the flasks to the incubators
