  1. Gelatin (ID:) coat 24 well plate and placed in incubator     13:26  \-  16:35 pm 

Perfrome harvest: Link to Harvest lab book:  

  1. Total cell number was:     7.15M (6M used for scaffold seeding)     

  2. Volume of cell suspension required for subculture was:     804 uL     

  3. Total cells per well: 47,916 ~~40000 cells/well (this was the amount used initially - may want to increase)~~
  4. Total cells required for a 24 well plate:  1150000

  1. Transferred    800  µl of cell suspension to the pre-warmed       12    mL Growth media:      16:37  
  2. Transferred cell suspension into the pre-gelatin coated       24 well plate     vessel.
  3. Left at RT in the BSC for 30 min to allow cells to settle      16:40  \-  17:00   
  4. Transferred vessel(s) to incubate at: 

  * [x]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (avian cells)
