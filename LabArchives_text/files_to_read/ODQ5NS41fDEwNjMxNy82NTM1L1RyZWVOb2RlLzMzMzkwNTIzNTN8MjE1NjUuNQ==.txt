### Process:

1\. Took image of vessel with microscope on phase setting.

2\. Gelatin coated  1x 10 CF and 2x T175 vessel with sterile filtered 0.1%
gelatin solution and then incubated all coated flasks at 37˚C.  

  1. Time when all vessels(s) placed into the incubator    15:25   

3\. Aliquotted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then
placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath for a minimum of 20 minutes
prior to use:

  1. TrypLE:  2x 40 mL  

  2.  dPBS 2x 80 mL  

  3. Growth media (for seeding):  1x 1500 (For C2C12), 1x 2.8 mL (BUFFY 20 wells in a 96-well plate), 1x60 mL (BUFFY T175)  

Time that all aliquots were placed in the water bath the warm before use
17:06

Note: if aliquots were placed in water bath at different time, record the time
stamp for each individual solution.

4\. Removed vessel(s) from the incubator    18 : 35  pm

5\. Washed the vessel(s) with dPBS (warmed).

6\. Added      10   mL tryple to each vessel/well and incubated at 37˚C.

  1. Start for TrypLE was   18  : 50  pm 

7\. Neutralised with     10mL     dPBS and combined cell suspension into a
50mL     tube.

8\. Centrifuged at 650 x g for 5 min.

  1. Start/Finish time for centrifugation was   19  : 07  pm

9\. Aspirated the supernatant(s).

10\. Resuspended pellet(s) in     8    mL    Growth      media   19  : 15
a/pm

11\. Aliquoted      10uL    of resuspended cells into a microcentrifuge tube
for cell count.

12\. Performed a cell count using the haemocytometer and recorded the cell
count data in the Google Doc spreadsheet: Cell Count Spreadsheet or cell count
widget below

  1. Total cell number was:       24mill      

  2. Volume of cell suspension required for subculture was:     2ul for 96wp, 848ul for 2x T175s (+ 2.8ml for 10CF - see below)        

  3. Cell density per vessel:     750/cm2       




BUFFY PASSAGE - 4XT175

13\. Transferred      As above     µl of cell suspension to the pre-warmed
2.8ml for 96wp, 60ml for 2x T175 (+ 1.5L for 10CF)      mL Growth media:
20 : 15   pm

14\. Transferred cell suspension into the pre-gelatin coated      2xT175s, 1x
10CF      vessel.

15\. Left at RT in the BSC for 30 min to allow cells to settle     20 : 15 -
20 : 45 pm  

16\. Transferred vessel(s) to incubate at:

  * [X]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (avian cells)




Observations/Summary:

Passage supposed to be for BUFFY6 and C2C12, but upon observation of C2C12
flasks prior to passage, AW saw they looked more primary like and density was
very low, whereas the BUFFY6 flasks were virtually fully confluent. As such,
only passaged flasks labelled BUFFY and left C2C12 flasks in culture. Need to
check cells 8.2.22

  

After discussion with Bec Screnci, we (AW + RS) concluded that there was a
mislabelling - AW proceed with C2C12 and thaw more BUFFY
