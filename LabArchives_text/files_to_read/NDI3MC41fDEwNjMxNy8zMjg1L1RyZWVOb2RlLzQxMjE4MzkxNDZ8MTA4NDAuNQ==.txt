NOTE  
We were expecting the CD4 Avian and CD4 CHO orders to arrive at Vow today
however neither arrived in time. Instead we received the Hycell CHO medium
which already contains pluronic/poloxamer by no L-glutamine. Media was
therefore prepared using the Hycell CHO without additional pluronic and with
added L-Glutamine, and this media will now be added to our study. Seeding of
suspension cultures was delayed until Monday, when we expect the CD4 Avian and
CD4 CHO to have arrived.




Media

1\. DMEM/F12 + 10% Knockout serum replacement + 1:100 anti-clumping agent +
0.1% pluronic + 100ng/mL each FGF, IGF1, PDGF  
 ~~2\. CDM4 Avian + 10% Knockout serum replacement + 1:100 anti-clumping agent
+ 0.1% pluronic 4uM L-glutamine + 100ng/mL each FGF, IGF1, PDGF~~ (did not
arrive in time to prepare)  
3\. ~~CDM4~~ HyCell CHO + 10% Knockout serum replacement + 1:100 anti-clumping
agent + ~~0.1% pluronic~~ 4uM L-glutamine + 100ng/mL each FGF, IGF1, PDGF  
4\. CD CHO +10% Knockout serum replacement + 1:100 anti-clumping agent +
~~0.1% pluronic~~ 4uM L-glutamine + 100ng/mL each FGF, IGF1, PDGF  
5\. RPMI + 10% Knockout serum replacement + 1:100 anti-clumping agent + 0.1%
pluronic + 100ng/mL each FGF, IGF1, PDGF




1\. Prepared growth media for each condition- See suspension trail #7 on the
media spreadsheet for details here:
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/124elwh67VrPyq7zPMqVI_g3-NUiVigjjaF64dVxeZa0/edit#gid=1560938043

Made 320 mL CD CHO medium and 100 mL of RPMI, CDM CHO & Control media with no
Growth Factors. Labelled and stored in fridge 104.

2\. Added the following medias to the water bath and warm at 37 degrees
Celsius

  * Re-suspension medium for DOLLY12  5mL DMEM/f12 +10% FBS + 1x p/s
  * dPBS (for washing and neutralising DOLLY12) 200 mL
  * Tryple (for passaging DOLLY12) 100 mL




## Passage and seed DOLLY12

1\. Removed vessel(s) from the incubator   16:10  

2\. Washed the vessel(s) with dPBS (a5618) (warmed).

3\. Added     100  mL tryple (m5076) to each vessel/well and incubated at
37ËšC.

  1. Start/Finish for TrypLE was   16:18 - 16:30 time  

4\. Neutralised with   100     dPBS and combined cell suspension into a   4 x
50 mL  

5\. Centrifuged at 650 x g for 5 min. 16:38 - 16:43  

6\. Re-suspend cells in 5mL pre-warmed growth media to perform cell count.
total 6mL  

7\. Take 20uL aliquot and perform cell
count.https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1DPzKubYxfHmWogVPihC-
SSIBtIylyrBQE5kRX5Z8NtI/edit#gid=0  
Total cell count= 74,412,000

8\. Resuspend 2,450,000 cells (cell suspension of 0.19755 mL) in 60 mL Growth
Medium and seed 2 x T175s

9\. Transfered flasks into the incubator 17:02
