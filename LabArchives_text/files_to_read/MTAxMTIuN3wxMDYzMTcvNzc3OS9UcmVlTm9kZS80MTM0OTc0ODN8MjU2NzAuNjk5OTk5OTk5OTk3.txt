### Process:

1\. Took image of vessel with microscope on phase setting.

3\. Aliquotted the required volume of each reagent at room temp  

  1. TrypLE:     2x50    mL 
  2.  dPBS (for neutralising):     1x50    mL
  3.  dPBS (for washing):     1x50    mL
  4. Growth media (for seeding):     3x30    mL across 3xT175 flasks, flasks placed at 30 degrees, 5% CO2.   

  




4\. Removed vessel(s) from the incubator

5\. Washed the vessel(s) with dPBS (warmed).

6\. Added     10mL (T175) or 5mL (T75)    tryple to each vessel/well and
incubated at 30ËšC.

7\. Neutralised with     equal volume    dPBS  and combined cell suspension
into    50mL     tubes.

8\. Centrifuged at 500 x g for 5 min.




9\. Aspirated the supernatant(s).

10\. Resuspended pellets for clones 2A, 2F and IGFBP4 4C in      1   mL of
cryostar CS10, cells were then transferred to 1.2mL cryotubes and placed in a
Mr Frosty and moved to the -80 fridge in the main lab.  

11\. Resuspended pellets for clones 1E and 2C in 1mL of dPBS. Split clone 1E
across two T175 flasks containing 30mL of growth media (500uL in each flask).
Transferred all of clone 2C suspension to a T175mL flask containing 30mL of
growth media.  

12\. Moved flasks to incubate at 30 degrees, 5% CO2.  




Observations/Summary:

Upon thaw cells should be placed back into a T175 flask.

Version Change Log

NameChange Details  
V1 (original)N/A  
V2Changed all sentences to past tense to better reflect a hand-written lab
book entry.  
Various formatting changes.  
Addition of more detail to step 2, removal of step 3. Replaced volume
requirements table with updated volumes @Sep 22, 2020  
Updated temperature selection for mammalian/aviary cells @Sep 23, 2020  
V3Included a section for 'vessel type' in passage ID table Replace
'flask/plate' with 'vessel' throughout lab book Include at step 1 to take
image of vessel on the microscope  
Mentioned that dPBS for washing should be warm - step 3(2) and 5.  
Added timepoint at step 4 for when vessel is removed from incubator  
Include at step 11 to aliquot cell resuspension into microcentrifuge tube  
Included at step 10 and 13 time point for when cell pellet is resuspended and
when resuspended cells is moved into growth media.  
Included p38i in table of regent used  
Combined two dPBS entries in 'Media/reagents' table Added 'cell density per
vessel'
