Notable Events:

  * After being fed with 50% fresh media on the 28th of January, due to a observed widespread fungal contamination throughout the laboratory, flasks were observed carefully under 40x magnification to identify for possible contamination. Spindle-like structures were found in only observable flask (1x4CF), indicating potential fungal growth within the cultures. It was therefore decided to discard the flasks due to the high risk of low level contamination in all of the flasks. See images of spindle structure below:
