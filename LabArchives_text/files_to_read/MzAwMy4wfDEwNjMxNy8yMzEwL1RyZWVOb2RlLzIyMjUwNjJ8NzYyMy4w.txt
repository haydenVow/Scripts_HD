### Observations/Summary:

In both cultures there are many dead cells. The living cells show very
splayed, spread out morphology consistent with observations of differentiated
cells, despite them still being quite spread apart at Day 6 in culture. This
indicates what we suspect, which is that the cells are no longer proliferating
well and are becoming senescent.
