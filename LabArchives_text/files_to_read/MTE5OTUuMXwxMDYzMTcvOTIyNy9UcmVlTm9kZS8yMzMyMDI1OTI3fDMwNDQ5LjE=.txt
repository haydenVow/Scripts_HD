Clones on culture 13136 were passaged by hand.  
  
Briefly.

  1. Cultures were imaged using the Primovert microscope under 5x objective, PHASE imaging. Images were inspected manually for a confluence estimate. Wells that appeared to have >90% confluence were selected for continuous passaging https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1yQD_JrhzktpQd0vaCt2B5OskKgl9SipLLab3WZ9v7ZU/edit#gid=1517361241&range=252:255
  2. Media was aspirated from these wells
  3. Wells were washed with 1mL of dPBS 
  4. Wash was removed and cells were covered with 1L of Tryple. 
  5. Cells were left to incubate for 10-12 minutes at 30 degrees, 5% CO2. 
  6. Tryple volume from each well was then transferred to a 15mL tube and cells were neutralised with 1mL of dPBS.
  7. Cells were spun down at 650g for 5 minutes. 
  8. Supernatant was removed and cells were resuspended in 5mL of growth media (DMEM/F12 + 20% FBS + 1xP/S).
  9. Cells were then plated back into individual T25 flasks. 
  10. The new cultures were returned to incubator 140.
