  1. Took 1 x 560 uL samples from each culture (1 x technical rep/flask).
  2. Performed counts using Vicell (560 uL/sample):

  3. Given counts are en par with eachother 1 week post-seeding into 90/10 RPMI/CHO and Lily will be seeding flasks from 90/10 RPMI/Hycell into 90/10 RPMI/CHO for her seeding density experiment, we decided to wrap up this experiment and use the cells to seed the Nuvonis cell waste media analysis experiment in CHO.
  4. Aliquoted the following mL of cell suspension into 10 x 15 mL tubes:

12382 x 5

12383 x 5

  5. Centrifuged the tubes @ 500 xg for 5 minutes.
  6. After centrifugation, aspirated the supernatant and resuspended cell pellet in 20 mL of medium. Then re-seeded flasks with the calculated volume of cell suspension.
  7. Replaced E125 in incubator at 37'C, 5% CO2, 120 RPM
