Myogenic purity was assessed using the following protocol.

One image pair (DAPI + AF555) captured using the Axio microscope under 10x
objective for each clone was analysed using FIJI software.

  1. One image pair from well B7 on culture 7238 was imported into FIJI. 
  2. Both images were converted to 8 bit. 
  3. A background subtraction was performed on each image (rolling radius = 50) 
  4. The 'despeckle' function was run on the AF555 image to remove free floating, saturated pixels. 
  5. The enhance contrast function was run on the AF555 image to boost the AF555 signal present. 
  6. 'Find Maxima' function was used to detected DAPI and AF555 stained cells in each images.
  7. AF555 and DAPI images were finally merged to highlight co localisation. 
  8.   




Maxima detected in DAPI image in well B7 (BUFFY6_25K6). 121 spots detected.
