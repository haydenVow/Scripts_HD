Prepare FreeStyle medium with L-glutamine:

1\. Aliquot 480 mL of FreeStyle Medium

2\. Add 20 mL of L-glutamine

  

1\. Aliquotted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then
placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath for a minimum of 20 minutes
prior to use:

  *  Growth media (for seeding):    60 mL  (2x 30 mL aliquots)  

  * Time that aliquot was placed in the water bath to warm before use:  15:20 

  




## Thaw and seed vial:

3\. Collected the cryovial from Liquid Nitrogen storage & place in foam
floater in water bath for 5 min 15:30 - 15:35

Location where cryovial was collected from:

Vial details:  1   x  CHO-S  cryovials at   10M  cells each for a total of
10M  cells

Brew Dewer

Tower/Bucket # 1

Box/Cane # 6  

Vial location:

Vial ID(s): No ID- was not entered into Airtable as it is not an exisiting
cell line  

`4. Ethanol sprayed & transferred the vial(s) to the BSC.`

`5.  Added  500 µL of Growth Media (to generate a total volume of 1.5 mL in
the cryovial) to the cryovial, resuspended the cell suspension gently to
reduce osmotic shock. `

`6. Collected the entire 1.5 mL of cell suspension & transfer into the pre-
warmed tube of Growth Media. `

`7. Using a 10mL serological pipette, resuspended & distributed the cells
evenly in the  2x 30 mL aliquots of pre-warmed Growth Media (prepared in Step
2). `

`8. Add 0.3 mL of Pen/Strep to one of the E125 flasks`

``

`8. Transfered flask/plate(s) to incubate at: `

  * [x]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (aviary cells)

  

Making labels

Note - You will need to increase the passage number by one. (i.e. if your
thawed vial ID has a passage number of 3, when you make a culture ID for you
vessel you will need change the passage number to 4 on Airtable.)
