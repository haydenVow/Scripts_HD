Process:

  1. Zaber scan 384 wp on phase (5x, exposure: 50, illuminator lamp: ~1). Finished at 13:22
  2. Aliquot 7.5 mL D/F + 10% FBS + 1x P/S and place in waterbath. 13:33 
  3. Prepared 1 mL of 7uL/ml of sterile Hoechst in PBS solution using 'new' Hoechst (stock ID: 3722 )  

  4. Prepare 1:1 solution of sterile Hoechst in PBS using 'old' Hoechst (stock ID: 2562). i.e. 15uL of each PBS and Hoechst was mixed together.  

  5. Removed 20uL/well of media from columns 1-6. (This was done to bring down the well volumes to 50uL/well which is what we have on day 7 of single cell cloning, before a feed is performed).
  6. Added 20uL/well of 'new' Hoechst staining solution to wells A to L of column 1 and A to F of column 2 (18 wells total).
  7. Added 2.3uL/well of 'old' Hoechst staining solution to wells A-G of column 7 (7 wells total).
  8. Incubated plate in the dark (in the incubator) 14:05 - 14:35. Kept plate in BSC for 5 mins after that with lid open to get rid of condensation.  

  9. Imaged all stained wells, as well as unstained wells (control) from columns 1 to 3.
    1. 5x (all)
    2. Phase: exposure 50, illuminator lamp: ~1
    3. DAPI: exposure 250 (for columns 1 to 3) and 40 (for column 7), illuminator lamp: 55
      1. Realised when trying to image that there wasn't enough fluorescence coming from cells in columns 1 to 3 and a higher concentration of Hoechst is needed. Cells in column 7 were very bright.
  10. Performed a 100% feed on wells from column 1 and 2 that were stained. 
  11. Prepared a staining solution of 10uL new Hoechst in 1 mL PBS. Used this to stain column 4 with 20uL/well.
  12. Placed plate in incubator 15:12 - 15:27.
  13. Left plate in BSC with lid open 15:27-15:31
  14. Imaged column 4 as described in step 9.
  15. Performed 100% media change on columns 3, 4, and 5
  16. Returned plate to incubator 15:50  

    1. 37 degrees, 5% CO2, ID #68




Observations/Summary:

Hoechst stained and imaged 18 wells with 20uL/well of a 7uL/mL Hoechst in PBS
solution. I chose this concentration and volume because it would result in a
final conc of 2uL/mL of Hoechst in the wells. However, after incubation the
fluorescence looked very dim so we won't use these wells for data/further
investigation.

Hoechst stained and imaged another 16 wells with 20uL/well of a 10uL/mL
Hoechst in PBS solution. Performed a 100% feed on these cells (column 4) and
also on columns 3 and 5 (control). Cells also appeared dim with this. We will
need to check whether the current ImageJ macro is able to pick up cells from
these images. If not, a higher concentration will need to be tried.

  

Also stained 7 wells with an older stock of Hoechst which we have previously
observed cell death with.  I did not perform a feed on these wells - we want
to confirm that previous protocol results in cell death. (results TBD
depending on how cells look tomorrow). These cells looked very bright in terms
of fluorescence.
