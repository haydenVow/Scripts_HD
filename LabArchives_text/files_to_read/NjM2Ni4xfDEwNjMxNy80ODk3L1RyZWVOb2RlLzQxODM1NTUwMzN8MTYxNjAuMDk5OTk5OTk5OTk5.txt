Prepare materials for thaw and seed:

1\. Aliquotted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then
placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath for a minimum of 20 minutes
prior to use:

  *  Growth media (5mL per T25, for seeding):    40 mL 
  * Growth media (for re-suspending during cell count):   5 mL     

  * Time that aliquot was placed in the water bath to warm before use:  14 :28      




## Thaw and seed vial:  

2\. Collected the cryovial from Liquid Nitrogen storage & place in foam
floater in water bath for 5 min  14:39 -14:42  

Location where cryovial was collected from:

Vial details:   2   x   F_DOLLY12 cryovials at   1M  cells each for a total of
2M  cells

Brew

Tower/Bucket # 2

Box/Cane #2  

Vial location:D8, D9  

Vial ID(s): 2315-Culture-6303-Vial-36of115 , 2316-Culture-6303-Vial-37of115  

`3. Ethanol sprayed & transferred the vial(s) to the BSC.`

`4.  Added  ``500 µL`` of Growth Media (to generate a total volume of 1mL in
the cryovial) to the cryovial, resuspended the cell suspension gently to
reduce osmotic shock. `

`5. Took 1 x 10 uL sample from 1 mL cell suspension for cell count`  

`6. Collected the entire 1 mL of cell suspension & transferred into the pre-
warmed tube of 5 mL of Growth Media. `

`7. Performed cell count. Count = 1,608,000  
`

`8. Transferred `` 5.2 mL`` to growth medium for seeding to make up to  40mL
with  1,400,000  cells. (remember to remove 5.2mL from the 40mL aliquot before
adding the cell suspension). `

`9. Transferred 5 mL of cell suspension to each T25 flask  
`

`9. Transferred flasks to incubate at:   15:48  
`

  * [X]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (aviary cells)

  

Making labels

Note - You will need to increase the passage number by one. (i.e. if your
thawed vial ID has a passage number of 3, when you make a culture ID for you
vessel you will need change the passage number to 4 on Airtable.)
