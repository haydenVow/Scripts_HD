### Process:

3\. Aliquotted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then
placed all aliquots to bead bath at 37 degrees  

  1. Growth media (for seeding):     30    mL 




  

5\. Washed the vessel(s) with 10mL dPBS (room temp)

6\. Discarded washes then added    10     mL tryple to each vessel/well and
incubated at 30˚C, 5% CO2 for 8 minutes.  

7\. Neutralised with     10     dPBS and combined cell suspension into a
50mL    tube.

Took 20uL of resuspension for a cell count as per instructions below.

8\. Centrifuged at 500xg for 5 minutes.




CELL COUNT

11\. Aliquoted     20uL     of resuspended cells into a microcentrifuge tube
for cell count.

12\. Performed a cell count using the haemocytometer and recorded the cell
count data in the Google Doc spreadsheet: Cell Count Spreadsheet or cell count
widget below.

  1. Total cell number was:     4,160,000       

  2. Volume of cell suspension required for subculture () was (all cells).  

  3. Cell density per vessel:    5942 cells/cm^2       




13\. Resuspended cells in 4mL of growth media then transferred       1    mL
of cell suspension to 4xT175 flasks each containing 30mL of growth media.  

14\. Transferred vessel(s) to incubate at:

  * [x]  30ºC, 5% CO2 (CHOMP cells), incubator 140
