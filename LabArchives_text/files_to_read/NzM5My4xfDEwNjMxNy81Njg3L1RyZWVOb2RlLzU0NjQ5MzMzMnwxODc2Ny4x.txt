Process:

  1. Warm up pre-aliquotted     20mL     in 24w plate or bulk vessel ( 1.5 mL per well approx) 
    1. if media is provided in tube, plate out 1.5 mL per well into a new 24wp in relevant wells
  2. Placed tube in waterbath or plate in incubator for > 30min at    14:59 pm     

  3. Removed sample plates from the incubator and place in BSC (lights off)
  4. transferred sample plate (tray with cups) and feed plate into BSC.

  

Note* Samples were in rows C and D, not A and B. So E6 was transferred from
rows A-B to C-D in the new plate before transferring the tray, so that all
samples were in media.

  1. Remove parafilm from feed and sample plate. 
  2. Transferred all samples to fresh media plate by lifting tray over to new plate
  3. Parafilmed sample plates and returned vessel to incubate at:      15:46 pm
