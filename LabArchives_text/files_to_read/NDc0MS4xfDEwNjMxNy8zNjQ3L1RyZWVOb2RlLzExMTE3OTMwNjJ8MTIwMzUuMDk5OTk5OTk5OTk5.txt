Process:

  1. Aliquoted growth media as follows:
    * 10 mL each medium 12:25
    * 25 mL CDM4Avian & CD CHO 11:30
      * Placed in water bath  

  2. Prepared stain buffer in 15 mL tube by combining the following (1 drop of each stain solution per 1 mL of dPBS):
    * 4 mL of dPBS 
    * 8 drops of NucBlue Live Cell Stain ReadyProbes Hoechst 33342
    * 4 drops of NucGreen Dead 488 Cell Stain ReadyProbes Sytox Green
      * Vortexted mix for ~5 seconds, then stored in dark until ready to use.  12:24 a/pm 

  
E-125 flasks

  1. Collected E125s from shaker, wiped with ethanol-sprayed Rediwipe, and brought into BSC
  2. Using a 25 mL serelogical pipette, gently pipette-mixed culture for 1 minute to break up cell clumps
  3. Pipette suspension though 70 um cell strainer into 2 x 50 mL tubes. Kept E125 vessels in BSC, as culture will be returned to this vessel after feed. 
  4. Centrifuged 50 mL tubes at 300 x g for 5 min.   11:40 - 11:45 
  5. Aspirated   100% (25 mL) of supernatant, taking extra care to not disrupt or aspirate pellet 
  6. Added  25 mL of fresh, warmed growth media to each 50 mL tube
  7. Gently pipette-mixed cultures using serelogical, before moving cell suspension back to E125s
  8. Took 100 uL samples from each culture and loaded into wells F2 (CD CHO) & G2 (AVIAN) of 1 x 96-well plate
  9. Returned E125s to incubator.   12:04

50 mL shake tubes

  1. Paused shaker by pressing the "play" button on the controller on the side wall of the incubator
  2. Collected 10 x 50 mL shake tubes being fed from shaker 
  3. Centrifuged at 300 x g for 5 min.  12:25 - 12:30   

  4. While tubes were centrifuging, loaded protocol linked below (added protocol as attachment) on computer next to OT2 and set up deck as described at calibration step
  5. Set up staining plate reagents (titled "staining plate" in protocols)
    1.  ~~For 6 or fewer samples:  ~~
      1.  ~~Loaded 150 uL of stain buffer into column 1 of 96-well plate.~~
      2.  ~~Loaded 100 uL of filtered dPBS into columns 3 & 4 of 96-well plate.~~
    2. For 7-12 samples:
      1. Loaded 300 uL of stain buffer into column 1 of 96-well plate.
      2. Loaded 100 uL of filtered dPBS into columns 3, 4, 7 & 8 of 96-well plate.
  6. Added 100 uL samples from E-flasks to appropriate wells to be stained by OT2, or into a separate 96-WP to be stained by hand
  7. Ethanol-sprayed  10 x 50 mL shake tubes and loaded on OT2 
  8. Collected 5 x media aliquots from water bath, ethanol-sprayed, and loaded on OT2 deck. Ensured that media aliquots matched up with intended feed tubes i.e. medium in A1 of 15 mL tube rack is intended for culture in A1 of 50 mL tube rack, medium in A4 is intended for culture in B1 of 50 mL tube rack, etc. 
  9. Order of media in mL tube rack:
    * A1: HyCell
    * A2: RPMI
    * A3: CD CHO
    * A4: Avian
    * A5: Control
  10. Calibrated for protocol 
  11. Ran protocol  
    1. Start time: 12:36:58 PM
    2. End time: 13:13
    3. Total run time: 36 min 35 seconds
  12. Plate map of culture IDs in 96-WP for imaging:  
Key: purple = 50% dilution, dark blue = 25% dilution, green = 12.5% dilution

  13. Returned vessels to incubator  13:17    

  14. If more tubes require feeding, collect next set of 50 mL shake tubes from incubator and repeat process (copy and paste process below to record timestamps).

### Staining Process for cell count

  1. Added 100 uL samples from 6-WPs and E-flasks to staining buffer in 96WP and performed serial dilution by hand to achieve a 12.5% final dilution
  2. Added culture IDs to plate map above
  3. Incubated culture in stain at RT in dark for 20 - 30 minutes  13:13 - 13:43 a/pm 
  4. Centrifuged the 96-well plate at 650 RCF for 1 minute. Timestamp: 13:48 - 13:49 a/pm
  5. Took whole well micrographs using the Zaber microscope on blue & green fluorescence channels (DAPI & 488) 
    * Culture ID images were stored under:     7858      

  6. Counted total cells (blue fluorescent nuclei, stained with Hoechst33342) and dead cells (green fluorescent nuclei, stained with Sytox green)

### Observations/Summary:

Opentron observations/issues:

1) Need to either raise arm of pipette when aspirating media, do in 2 x 15 mL
tubes, or switch to 1 x 50 mL tubes for fresh media because arm is going too
deep into tube.

Zaber observations/issues:

General observations/issues:

1) No PDGF-BB added to cultures as the lab is out - more has been ordered

 100   % media changed on vessel(s)

  1. All vessels
