CHO-S:

Growth medium (CHOMP): DMEM/F12 + 20%FBS + 1xP/S

Growth medium (CHO-S): HyCell CHO + 4mM Glutamax + 1xP/S

## Process

  1. Prepared cell suspensions of CHOMP07 fibroblasts and CHO-S cells 
    1. 1 x 3,200 cells per mL (2 mL with 6,400 cells total) 
    2. 1 x 200,000 cells per mL (2 mL with 400,000 cells total) 
  2. Perform serial dilution. Follow process for both CHOMP and CHO-S cells (1):
    1. Added 6 x 1 mL aliquots of warmed growth medium to 6 x sterile eppendorf tubes (6 per cell type)
    2. Moved 1 mL from the 200,000 cells/mL suspension to 1 x 1 mL growth medium aliquot (2 mL, 100,000 cells / mL)
    3. Moved 1 mL from the 100,000 cells/mL cell suspension and added to next 1 mL growth medium aliquot (2 mL, 50,000 cells / mL)
    4. Moved 1 mL from the 50,000 cells/mL cell suspension and added to the next 1 mL growth medium aliquot (2 mL, 25,000 cells / mL)
    5. Moved 1 mL from the 25,000 cells/mL cell suspension and added to the next 1 mL growth medium aliquot (2 mL, 12,500 cells / mL)
    6. Moved 1 mL from the 12,500 cells/mL cell suspension and added to the next 1 mL growth medium aliquot (2 mL, 6,250 cells / mL)
    7. Moved 1 mL from the 12,500 cells/mL cell suspension and added to the next 1 mL growth medium aliquot (2 mL, 6,250 cells / mL)
  3. Perform serial dilution. Follow process for both CHOMP and CHO-S cells (2):
    1. Added 6 x 1 mL aliquots of warmed growth medium to 6 x sterile eppendorf tubes (6 per cell type)
    2. Moved 1 mL from the 3,200 cells/mL suspension to 1 x 1 mL growth medium aliquot (2 mL, 1,600 cells / mL)
    3. Moved 1 mL from the 1,600 cells/mL cell suspension and added to next 1 mL growth medium aliquot (2 mL, 800 cells / mL)
    4. Moved 1 mL from the 800 cells/mL cell suspension and added to the next 1 mL growth medium aliquot (2 mL, 400 cells / mL)
    5. Moved 1 mL from the 400 cells/mL cell suspension and added to the next 1 mL growth medium aliquot (2 mL, 200 cells / mL)
    6. Moved 1 mL from the 200 cells/mL cell suspension and added to the next 1 mL growth medium aliquot (2 mL, 100 cells / mL)
    7. Moved 1 mL from the 100 cells/mL cell suspension and added to the next 1 mL growth medium aliquot (2 mL, 50 cells / mL)
