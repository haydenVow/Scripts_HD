### Process:

1\. Took image of vessel with microscope on phase setting. (FORGOT TO TAKE
IMAGES BEFORE TYPLE)

2\. Gelatin coated    2 X 4CF + 2 X 2CF       vessel  with sterile filtered
0.1% gelatin solution and then incubated all coated flasks at 37˚C. (Will seed
onto a 4CF and any spare cells into the 2CF)

  1. Time when all vessels(s) placed into the incubator      09:45 

3\. Aliquotted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then
placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath for a minimum of 20 minutes
prior to use:

  1. TrypLE:      60   mL in      1   tub.
  2.  dPBS (At 37 degrees for washing):        60 mL in       1 tubes
  3.  dPBS (at RT neutralising):      60   mL in    1    tubes
  4. Growth media (for pellet resuspension):     20mL   in 1 tube  

  5. Growth media (for seeding):   1.5       mL in       3  bottles

Time that all aliquots were placed in the water bath the warm before use
11:30

Note: if aliquots were placed in water bath at different time, record the time
stamp for each individual solution.




4\. Removed vessel(s) from the incubator    11:40

5\. Washed the vessel(s) with dPBS (warmed).

6\. Added     10    mL tryple to each vessel/well and incubated at 37˚C.

  1. Start/Finish for TrypLE was    11:45-11:57 

7\. Neutralised with     10     dPBS and combined cell suspension into 2x
50mL     tube.

8\. Centrifuged at 650 x g for 5 min.

  1. Start/Finish time for centrifugation was   12:10-12:15 




9\. Aspirated the supernatant(s).

10\. Resuspended pellet(s) in     10    mL     growth   media     12:20  

11\. Aliquoted     50     of resuspended cells into a microcentrifuge tube for
cell count (x2).

12\. Performed a cell count using the haemocytometer and recorded the cell
count data in the Google Doc spreadsheet called 'Cell Count Spreadsheet' (see
link below):

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1DPzKubYxfHmWogVPihC-
SSIBtIylyrBQE5kRX5Z8NtI/edit#gid=0

  1.  Total cell number was:      7.7M       

  2. Volume of cell suspension required for subculture was:     entire        

  3. Cell density per vessel:     3.1M into each 4CF 770,000 into 1.5M into 2CF       




13\. Transferred       1.9mL   of cell suspension to the pre-warmed      300
mL Growth media, and     4mL   of cell suspension to each of the the pre-
warmed      600    mL Growth media:     12:27  

14\. Transferred cell suspension into the pre-gelatin coated     2x 4CF and 1x
2CF       vessel.

15\. Left at RT in the BSC for 30 min to allow cells to settle    12:30-13:00  

16\. Transferred vessel(s) to incubate at:

  * [x]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells) thermo incubator
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (avian cells)
