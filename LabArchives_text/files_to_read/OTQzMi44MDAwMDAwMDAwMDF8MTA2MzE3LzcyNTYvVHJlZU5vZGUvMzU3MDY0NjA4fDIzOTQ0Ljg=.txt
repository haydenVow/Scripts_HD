Took samples

  1. Sprayed down the sample line end with 70% ethanol.
  2. Connected a 5 mL sterile syringe.
  3. Withdrew 1 mL (first-draw)
  4. Disconnected sample syringe and transferred 1 mL of sample each to 1.5 mL Eppendorf tubes for cell count
  5. Connected a fresh sterile syringe and withdrew 1 mL of sample (second-draw).
  6. Disconnected sample syringe and transferred 1 mL of sample each to 1.5 mL Eppendorf tubes for cell count
  7. Sprayed sample line with 70% ethanol.
  8. Performed cell count: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1DPzKubYxfHmWogVPihC-SSIBtIylyrBQE5kRX5Z8NtI/edit#gid=0

  * stirring speed: 100
  * pH: 7.60
  * dissolved oxygen: 76.0
  * temperature: 37

\- Cell count reduced drastically (from 1.5M cells/mL -> 900K cells/mL)

\- Higher than usual amounts of cell debris present during cell count

\- Continue monitoring over the next few days
