AIM/PURPOSE: To optimise conditions for creation of fibroblast aggregates. To
determine if the concentration of TGFb or Vitamin C or the presence/absence of
shaking has an effect on timing or quantity of fibroblast aggregates formed.

MILESTONE: Establish a WCB for fibroblasts (but a bit tangental to current
milestones, given the current push to deploy this into production).  
HYPOTHESIS: 10ng/mL TGFb + 50ug/mL vitamin C + shaking are the optimal
conditions for formation of fibroblast aggregates.

RESULTS SUMMARY:

CONCLUSION:

NEXT STEPS:

  1. Deploy optimal conditions into production on Friday May 7th
