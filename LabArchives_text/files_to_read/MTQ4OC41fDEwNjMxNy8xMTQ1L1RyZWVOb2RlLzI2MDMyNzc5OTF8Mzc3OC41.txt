## Performed by: KK  




Reagent preparation:

1\. Aliquotted     mL  PBS for washing

2\. Centrifuged the secondary antibody stock using the benchtop
microcentrifuge for 10 seconds.

3\. Prepared Secondary Antibody mix:

  20 µL   Secondary #1Goat Anti-Mouse (IgG2b)   (1:1000  ) +  20 µL  Goat
Anti-Mouse (IgG1) Secondary #2   (1:1000  ) +  20  mL Blocking Buffer (PBST
(0.1% Triton X + dPBS) + 3% BSA)  

If using AlexaFluor secondary antibodies then the max concentration should be
1:500 (typically used at 1:1000)

Vortexed antibody mix for 5 seconds and stored refrigerated away from light
until needed.

4\. Prepared DAPI mix:

  20 mL  PBS +   20 uL  of DAPI

Vortexed DAPI mix and stored refrigerated away from light until needed.

Process:

1\. Removed plate from fridge (incubated in primary antibodies overnight).

2\. Washed 3 times for 5 min with PBS at RT.

 15:02 - 15:07 pm

 15:09 - 15:14 pm

 15:16 - 15:21 pm

3\. Incubated the cells with secondary antibody mixture in the dark at RT for
1 hour.  15:40 - 16:40 pm

NOTE: from this step onwards protect from the light by wrapping plates in foil
and perform experiment in the dark.




Counter staining

1\.  Removed 2nd antibody solution.  16:40 pm

2\.  Washed with DAPI (1:1000) in PBS for 5 min at RT in the dark.

 16:43 - 16:50 pm

3\.  Washed in PBS 3 x 5 min at RT in the dark. (No Triton)

 16:52 - 16:57 pm

 17:00 - 17:05 pm

4\.  Replaced dPBS.

 17:08 pm

5\. Confirmed staining on microscope by imaging.
