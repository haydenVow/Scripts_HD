Procedure




The media aliquot was filtered prior to adding into the E500 due to the vessel
coming into contact with the water bath.




The cell suspension from the 3 x ULA 6WPs was pooled and counted (89 mL in
total). It was noted that the count had halved compared to yesterday (218k ->
126k), with no marked drop in cell viability. The empty 6WPs were examined
under the microscope to verify if all the cells had been transferred and this
appeared to be the case, apart from a few aggregates that remained adhered to
the plates. The cell suspension was transferred into a E500 and topped with
the remainder of the media from M12763 (118 mL), bringing the total volume to
207 mL.  
  
The final seeding density of the E500 has been calculated below:

(126k cells / mL x 89 mL) / 207 mL = ~54200 cells / mL

Note: Despite the seeding density being lower than expected, the cells will
hopefully have more time to reach the desired density over the long weekend.
