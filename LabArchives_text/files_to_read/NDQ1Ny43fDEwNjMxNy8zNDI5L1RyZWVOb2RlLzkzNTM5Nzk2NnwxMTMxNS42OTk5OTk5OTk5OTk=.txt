## Performed by: LL  




Perform feed using below volumes:

  




Differentiation Media:

  * E6  
  
Total media required: 24 mL

Media aliquoted into a black 50 mL falcon tube labelled 'SUN' on the top and
'E6 ESTIM' on the side. Aliquot left in the Main Lab Biomaterials Fridge.

## Waveform Check

1\. Pressed one of the three largest buttons on the oscilloscope inward to
wake up the device.  
  
2\. Record if the waveforms are curved or rectangular. Select one:

#

[  ] Both are curved.  
[  ] Both are rectangular.  
[  ] The purple waveform is curved but the yellow waveform is rectangular.  
[  ] The yellow waveform is curved but the purple waveform is rectangular.  
  
This check indicates if the cells were receiving the stimulation or not.  




## Remove the Hooks and Warm the Media

1\. Aliquoted  1x 48 mL  mL of  E6 Dif Media into  1x 50mL  tube(s). Labelled
aliquots with the feed date and 'EPIC21489'.  
Placed aliquots in  biomaterials fridge  in main lab 10:40 11/08  

Note, only 24 mL is actually needed for this feed, but the aliquots may have
48 mL. Discard remaining.  
  
2\. Aliquots placed in water bath 09:15 am - 11:11  

3\. Removed the hook test clips from the electrode connection pins on the
culture dish lid   11:11  
  
The test hook can be released from the pin by squeezing the spring loaded test
hook handle. It is best not to touch the metal electrode pins while doing
this. Hold the plastic culture dish lid for stability. If any wires become
dislodged and the operator is unsure about reattachment, contact experiment
owner for assistance   Jared - 0420881185




##  ~~ ~~Imaging (not essential, only if possible)~~~~

 ~~1\. Imaged both plates, taking whole well images of every well using the
zaber  time  
~~

 ~~For information on how to use the zaber, refer to:

ad19527eee9e42ed9db96faa911d6536~~

 ~~Tips for imaging the 12WP are to use 8x8 imaging sites in the HSC site
generator, remembering to change the spacing rule to field of view with 60 um
spacing. Remember to build the MM List in the HSC site generator and confirm
the number of images expected (usually >700) in the ~~ ~~ ~~Mult-D Acq.~~~~




Feed Process:

1\. Moved the culture dish to the BSC   11:11  

2\. Removed the electrode culture lid and placed it on its back inside the BSC
to keep the electrodes sterile.

3\.  100% of supernatant from the vessel was removed.

A P1000 or a 5 mL serological is appropriate here to remove the supernatant.  
  
4\. Replaced with 2mL (per well/per vessel) of  E6 Dif  media.

A P1000 is appropriate here, since the media volume needs to be consistent
between wells for EStim.  
  
5\. Returned vessel to incubate and connected the test hooks back up to the
electrode pins on the culture dish lid so that each set of hooks connects to
the corresponding wire colour and so that the black hooks are aligned on the
left side of each well and the red hooks on the right (see wiring setup
reference image below)  11:18
