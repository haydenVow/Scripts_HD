12 x 96 wp will have this arrangement

### 4 x 96 wp will have this arrangement:

###

### Process:

1\. Took image of vessel with microscope on phase setting.

2\. Gelatin coated   16     x     96wp   \+ 1 x 2CF and 4 x 24wp  vessel with
sterile filtered 0.1% gelatin solution and then incubated all coated flasks at
37˚C.

  1. Time when all vessels(s) placed into the incubator       :   a/pm (3 November 2021) 
  2. 1 x 2CF and 4 x 24wp  : 11:56am 4/11/21

3\. Aliquotted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then
placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath for a minimum of 20 minutes
prior to use:

  1.  dPBS (for washing; needs to be warmed):    90     mL in    3 x 50ml    tubes  

  2. TrypLE (warmed):    90     mL in     3 x 50ml    tubes
  3.  dPBS (for neutralising) (does NOT need to be warmed):    90     mL in    3 x 50ml    tubes
  4. Growth media (for pellet resuspension):    12    mL in    1 x 15ml    tube
  5. Growth media (for seeding):    70 ml (C2C12) + 14 ml (MCB) + 84 ml (WCB)

Time that all aliquots were placed in the water bath the warm before use
13:05   a/pm

Note: if aliquots were placed in water bath at different time, record the time
stamp for each individual solution.




4\. Removed vessel(s) from the incubator     14:00 pm

5\. Washed the vessel(s) with dPBS (warmed).

6\. Added    10     mL tryple to each vessel/well and incubated at 37˚C.

  1. Start/Finish for TrypLE was     14:05 - 14:22  a/pm 

7\. Neutralised with    10      dPBS and combined cell suspension into    2 x
50ml  tube/ cell line (in total 6 tubes each containing 30 ml).

8\. Centrifuged at 650 x g for 5 min.

  1. Start/Finish time for centrifugation was    14:31 - 14:36 pm 




9\. Aspirated the supernatant(s).

10\. Resuspended pellet(s) in   6 ml (C2C12); 1 ml (MCB); 3 ml (WCB)   mL
DMEM/F12 + 20% FBS + 1x P/S + p38i   media     15:10 pm

11\. Aliquoted    10 uL   of resuspended cells into a microcentrifuge tube for
cell count (For EVERY cell line).

13\. Transferred    482 uL (C2C12); 285 uL (DOLLY12 MCB); 1.32 ml (DOLLY12
WCB) µl of cell suspension to the pre-warmed     70 ml (C2C12); 14ml (DOLLY12
MCB); 84ml (DOLLY12 WCB) mL Growth media:      16:00 pm

14\. Transferred cell suspension into the pre-gelatin coated      96 wp
vessel.

15\. Left at RT in the BSC for 30 min to allow cells to settle      16:25  \-
16:55 pm (MCB vs. WCB plates); 17:00 - 17:45 (DOLLY12 WCB); 17:35- 18:10
(DOLLY12 C2C12)  

16\. Transferred vessel(s) to incubate at:

  * [X]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (avian cells)

  

CELL & MEDIA REQUIREMENTS:

Growth media for C2C12: 54 wells/ plate * 6 plates * 0.2 ml/well = 64.8 ml
needed (Aliquot 70 ml of growth media)

C2C12 cells: 750 cells/well / 0.2ml/well = 3750 cells/ml * 70 ml (aliquotted
growth media) = 262.5 K cells

  

Growth media for DOLLY12 MCB: 16 wells/plate * 4 plates * 0.2ml/well = 12.8 ml
(Aliquot 14 ml of growth media)

DOLLY12 MCB cells: 2000 cells/well / 0.2ml/well= 10 000 cells/ml * 14ml = 140
K cells

  

Growth media for DOLLY12 WCB: 70 ml + 14 ml = Aliquot 84 ml of growth media
(including excess)

DOLLY12 WCB cells: 2000 cells/well / 0.2ml/well= 10 000 cells/ml * 84 = 840 K
cells

  

  

Cell expansion / nutrition expansion cell requirement:

  

DOLLY MCB

1 x 24wp = seeding density of 1000 cells/cm2 =  45 600cells = 0.092 mL

1 x 24wp = seeding density of 6000 cells/cm2 = 273 600 cells (leftover)  = ~
0.648

  

C2C12

1 x 24wp = seeding density of 500 cells/cm2  =22800  cells =
0.04191176470588235 mL

1 x 24wp = seeding density of 7000 cells/cm2 = 273 600 cells = 0.502 mL

1 x 2CF = 700K cells = 1.29 mL

1 x 4CF = 1.4M cells = 2.58 mL
