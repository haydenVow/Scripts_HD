Aim/Purpose


To assess whether DOLLY and NANDO fibroblast cells frozen as either raw
isolates, MCB and WCB offer an advantage in obtaining cells that can be
adapted to suspension conditions.


Hypothesis


DOLLY and NANDO fibroblast cells thawed into suspension from the raw isolate
and MCB stages will perform better than cells thawed from WCB, with respect to
cell survival and viability.


Technical Gap


Katie- I've been under the impression that this section was for details
concerned with limitations with what we've been able to achieve or limitations
that we are still trying to overcome. However Tom mentioned to me that this
section is what James uses for the science R&D tax, so I'll just leave it
blank for now.


Method/Procedure


Experimental Plan:

Preparation of media

RPMI or DMEM/F12 (need to decide) \- will have more information based on
suspension #9 pilot work if RPMI is more suited for fibroblast growth compared
to DMEM/F12. Current assumption will be either:

[x] RPMI + 5% FBS + 1X P/S + 0.1% pluronic + ACA (1:100)

[x] DMEM/F12 + 5% FBS + 1X P/S + 0.1% pluronic + ACA (1:100)

  

[DO - Suspension adaptation]

1\.  Collect vials of fibroblasts from the three different timepoints and thaw
directly into suspension. The conditions are setup as follows with each
condition performed in triplicate:

2\. Perform media changes and counts every four days for a 30-day time period
i.e. D2, D6, D10, D14, D18, D22, D26, D30. Centrifuge cells at 300x g for 5
minutes, discarding the supernatant and resuspending the cell pellet in 5 mL
of growth media.

3\. Take 100 uL samples of each condition following pellet resuspension to
perform cell counts. Cell counts will be accomplishing using the total
cell/dead cell counting protocol (Hoechst and Sytox) on the Opentrons and
images will be analysed using the newly developed suspension counts macros
incorporated in MIA.

4\. Track viability and cell counts over the 30 day period, noting tends
and/or observations.
