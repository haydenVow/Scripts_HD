NameDetails (reagent ID)  
dPBS (for washing & neutralising) 5616  
Growth Media 6100  
  
  

  




Process:

1.checked chunks under microscope to check for contamination or fibroblasts--
none seen  

2\.  did not warm media as temps up to 35C can be lethal, used media straight
from fridge (although allowing to warm to room temp can't hurt in the future!)  

3\. gently topped up media by slowly adding 1mL GM to side of well, taking
care not to dislodge chunks from the bottom of the plate

4\. returned to incubator at 28C with no CO2  




Observations/Summary:

no contamination seen, no firbroblasts have migrated out of the tissue yet,
but this can take up to 45 days




Relevant Images/Figures (if applicable): N/A
