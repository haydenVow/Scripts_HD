Experimental Plan DAISY4_16G9 MCB_2 to WCB_2


Day 1: Tuesday  
Revive 1 x vial of cells into 3 x T175 flasks




Day 2: Wednesdauy

50% Feed 3 x T175 flasks




Day 4: Friday

Passage DAISY4_16G9 cells from 3 x T175 flasks into 1 pellet.

Divide pellet by 4

Seed 1/4 into adherent culture at 1,000 cells / cm2

Seed 3/4 into suspension culture on microcarriers at need specific density

  




Day 6: Sunday

50% Feed DAISY4_16G9 cells in both:

\- Adherent culture (x flasks)

\- Suspension culture (x shake flasks)




Day 7: Monday

Passage DAISY4_16G9 cells from:  
\- Adherent culture (x flasks into as many flasks as possible at 1,000 cells /
cm2)  
Note* Collect 60K cells from adherent culture and seed into Differentiation
Assay (see Experimental Plan Diff Assay)

\- Suspension culture (x flasks into as many flasks as possible at need
specific density




Day 9: Wednesday

50% Feed DAISY4_16G9 cells in both:

\- Adherent culture (x flasks)

\- Suspension culture (x shake flasks)




Day 10/11: Thursday/Friday

Harvest cells from adherent culture as per passaging SOP.

Count cell pellet.

Centrifuge cells and resuspend at a concentration of 1M cells / mL in freeze
media

Bank down all cells at 500K cells per cryovial in 500uL.

(e.g. if 21M cells, resuspend cells in 21mL of freeze media, and generate 42
vials of 500K cells in 500uL each).

Place in Mr Frostys (less than 5 freeze cycles) and place in -80ºC freezer
overnight.




Day 10/11: Thursday/Friday

Harvest cells from suspension culture as per microcarrier harvest SOP.

Count cell pellet.

Centrifuge cells and resuspend at a concentration of 1M cells / mL in freeze
media

Bank down all cells at ~900K-1M cells per cryovial in 900-1000uL.

(e.g. if 27M cells, resuspend cells in 27mL of freeze media, and generate 27
vials of 1M cells in 1mL each  
OR  
if 27M cells, resuspend cells in 27mL of freeze media and generate 30 vials of
900K cells in 900uL each).  
Ideal cell numbers are for revival of cells into microcarrier culture, so
900K-1M cell range works fine either way.

Place in Mr Frostys (less than 5 freeze cycles) and place in -80ºC freezer
overnight.

  




After freezing cells, transfer to LN storage and record on Sv1 the exact
location of each cryovial in Brew dewer.
