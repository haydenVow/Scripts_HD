  1. Took 2 x 550 uL samples from each culture (2 x technical reps/flask).
  2. Performed counts using Vicell (510 uL/sample):

* In red, those that were discarded.

  3. Aliquotted 120 mL of CHO HD basal medium, and added 120uL of IGF and 24uL of EGF to it.
  4. Combine 2 x 5.044 mL (containing 2M cells in total) of each of the 3 x cell suspension into 1 x 50mL tube (total volume: 30.264 mL).
  5. Centrifuged the tubes @ 500 xg for 5 minutes.
  6. In the meantime, added 19 mL of pre-warmed media into each E-125.
  7. After centrifugation, aspirated the supernatant and resuspended cell pellet in 6 mL of CHO HD Part A + Nuvonis. Then dispensed 1 mL of cell suspension into every 6 x E-125.
  8. Replaced E125 in incubator at 37'C, 5% CO2, 120 RPM
  9. Prepared the CHOin1 feed medium and added 1 mL of feed medium to flasks.
