D1 MuSC Prolif samples- Fix, MyoD, DAPI stain and Image 1 sample from each
condition. Note down whether there is a good cell coverage across the
material/scaffold surface.

Process:

1\. Removed plate culture IDs: 6496-DOLLY12-Sheep P11-1of1  containing
scaffolds from the incubator.

2\. Used sterile tweezers to carefully transfer   5x (highlighted in bold in
the image above)   scaffold pieces to separate wells on a 24 well plate.

3\. Washed the pieces in the 24 well plate 3x in   200 uL of PBS for  5
minutes at room temperature.

  1. 14:27 - 14:32   

  2. 14:33 - 14:38   

  3. 14:39 - 14:44   

  




4\. Added 150 uL of 4% PFA to each scaffold and incubate for  15  min at room
temperature.  14:47 - 15:02  




5. Wash the pieces 3 times for   5    minutes in   200  uL of PBS.

  1. 15:03 - 15:08   

  2. 15:11 - 15:16   

  3. 15:17 - 15:22   

  

6\. Aspirate the PBS and leave the scaffold pieces just covered by fresh PBS.

7\. Proceed with primary antibody staining.

1\. Prepared   1.5 mL  PBST (0.2% Triton-X)

2\. Prepared 1.5 mL  blocking buffer: PBST (0.1% Triton-X + PBS) + 3% bovine
serum albumin (BSA). (Kept in the fridge until needed in blocking step)

3\. Prepared Primary Antibody Mix:  7.5 µL   Primary #1 MyoD (Santa Cruz)
(1:200  ) + 1492.5µL Blocking Buffer  
  
Total volume required =  1500 uL

Vortexed antibody mix for 5 seconds and stored refrigerated away from light
until needed.

Process:

Permeabilise

1\. Removed PBS from each well.

2\. Added 150 µL PBST (0.2% Triton-X) to each well for 15 min:  15:26 - 15:41

3\. Aspirated PBST for each well.




Blocking

1\. Added  150 µL of blocking buffer per well (3% BSA in PBST [0.1% Triton-X])
and incubate for 45 minutes - 1hr at RT. (no more than 1 hour):  15:43 - 15:39




Single Primary Antibody staining

1\. Removed blocking buffer from each well.

2\. Incubated cells with primary antibody overnight at 4'C, parafilmed and
wrapped in foil: 15:45

After this step, all further task should be performed in a dark room. The
vessel should also be wrapped foil when not used.
