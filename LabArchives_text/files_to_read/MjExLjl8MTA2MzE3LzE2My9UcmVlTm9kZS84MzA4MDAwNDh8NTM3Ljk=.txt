Growth Media:

  * [x]  DMEM/F12 + 20% FBS + 1X P/S

  

Process:

1\. Aliquotted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then
placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath for a minimum of 20 minutes
prior to use:

  1.  Growth media (for seeding):   30 mL in  1x 50 mL  tube 

Time that aliquot was placed in the water bath to warm before use: 09:38

2. Collected the cryovial from Liquid Nitrogen storage & place in foam floater in water bath for 5 min  10:06 - 10:11 

Location where cryovial was collected from:

 Brew  1 Tower / Bucket # 5

Box / Cane # 2

Vial location: A6  

Vial ID(s): 2113-Culture-5951-Vial-1of15

3\. Ethanol sprayed & transferred the vial(s) to the BSC.

4\. Added  500 µL of Growth Media (to generate a total volume of 1mL in the
cryovial) to the cryovial, resuspended the cell suspension gently to reduce
osmotic shock.

5\. Collected the entire 1mL of cell suspension & transfer into the pre-warmed
tube of Growth Media.

6\. Using a 10mL serological pipette, resuspended & distributed the cells
evenly in the  30 mL of pre-warmed Growth Media (prepared in Step 2).

7\. Transfered  30 mL to each   1x T175  flask

8. Transfered flask/plate(s) to incubate at: 10:16 

  * [x]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (aviary cells)

  

Making labels

Note - You will need to increase the passage number by one. (i.e. if your
thawed vial ID has a passage number of 3, when you make a culture ID for you
vessel you will need change the passage number to 4 on Airtable.)

Process:

1\. Aliquotted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then
placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath for a minimum of 20 minutes
prior to use:

  1.  TrypLE:  200 mL in | 2x 120 mL | pots 
  2.  dPBS (for neutralising)   400 mL in | 1x 500 mL | pot 
  3.  Growth media (for pellet resuspension):   30 mL in | 1x 50 mL | tubes 
  4.  Time that all aliquots were placed in the water bath to warm before use:  11:07 

Note: if aliquots were placed in water bath at different times, record the
time stamp for each individual solution.

2\. Washed the flask(s) with dPBS.

3\. Added | 200 |mL tryple to each vessel/well and incubated at 37ºC for | 37
| min

  1.  Start/Finish time for TrypLE was:   11:36 - 12:13  

4\. Poured Tryple out of the 4CF into 1x 500 mL pot.

5\. Aliquoted cell suspension into 8x 50 mL tubes (make sure to weight one
tube and label it- this will be the tube that all the cell suspension will be
transfered into) Tube weight:  12.450g  

6\. Added 100 mL dPBS to 4CF, washed 4CF, then poured into the 500 mL pot

7\. Repeated steps 5-6.

8\. Centrifuged at 650 x g for 5 min

  1.  Start/Finish time for centrifugation was:   12:30 - 12:35 

9\. Aspirated the supernatant(s).

10\. Resuspend pellet(s) in | 30 |mL | Growth | media.

11\. Took 1 x 100 uL samples from the cell suspension. From the 100 uL sample,
took 1 x 10 uL sample.

12\. Performed a cell count using the haemocytometer and recorded the cell
count data in the Google Doc spreadsheet called 'Cell Count Spreadsheet' (see
link below):

SSIBtIylyrBQE5kRX5Z8NtI/edit#gid=0

13\. Total cell number was: | 114,465,000 |

14\. Calculate the required volume cell suspension & freeze medium to generate
a concentration of ~1E6 (1M) cells/mL.

15\. Prepared  58 mL Freeze Medium: (FBS + 10% DMSO). ID #  

Stored at 4ºC until use to keep chilled. 5.8mL DMSO + 52.2mL FBS

16. Centrifuged cells at 650 x g for 5 min.  14:04 - 14:09 

Whilst centrifuge is spinning, prepared & printed vial labels, labelled
cryovials. (Note that passage number will be the same as the culture you
harvest from. The passage number will increase by 1 during the revive of a
vial.

17\. Aspirated supernatant carefully, taking care not to disturb the pellet.

18\. Weight the tube with cell pellet inside. Tube weight with cell pellet:
13.041g, weight of pellet = 0.591 g

19\. Resuspended the pellet in | 57.5 |mL freeze media (chilled, to reduce
DMSO toxicity).

20\. Aliquotted | 500 |µL into | 117 | x cryovials (already labelled).

21\. Tightened the lids & transfer the cryovials to a Mr. Frosty immediately
into the -80ºC freezer.   15:05pm

22\. Allow the cells to freeze for at least 18-24 hours before transferring to
Liquid Nitrogen storage.
