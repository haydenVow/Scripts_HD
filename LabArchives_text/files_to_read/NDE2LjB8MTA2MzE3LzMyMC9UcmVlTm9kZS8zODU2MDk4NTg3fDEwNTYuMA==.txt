Background:  
  
After dry heat treatment in the dry-heat oven at 120'C for 2 hours (see
previous entry) we wanted to assess how stable the gelatex samples were under
cell culture conditions.  
  
Method:  
  
\- Samples (n=1 gelatin gelatex and n=1 zein gelatex) which were exposed to
two rounds of 60 min heat treatment at 120'C were placed into DMEM/F12 media
and placed in the incubator at 37'C, 5% CO2 at 10:45  
  
\- Samples were checked at 16:00, the gelatin sample retained shape and
integrity, whereas the zein sample had degraded into smaller more fragile
pieces
