Growth Media:

  * [x ]  DMEM/F12 + 10% FBS + 1X P/S 




### Process:

1\. Took 2x image of vessel with microscope on phase setting.  

3\. Aliquotted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then
placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath for a minimum of 20 minutes
prior to use: time

  1. TrypLE:    2     mL in     1 x 15mL Falcon Tube  tub
  2.  dPBS (for washing and neutralising):    2mL    mL 
  3. dPBS (for neutralising):    2mL    mL
  4. Growth media (for pellet resuspension):   1   mL 
  5. Growth media (for seeding):  11  mL.

Time that all aliquots were placed in the water bath the warm before use
12:49pm  

Note: if aliquots were placed in water bath at different time, record the time
stamp for each individual solution.




4\. Removed vessel(s) from the incubator   12:56pm  

5\. Washed the vessel(s) with dPBS (warmed).

6\. Added    2   mL tryple to each vessel/well and incubated at 37˚C.

  1. Start/Finish for TrypLE was    13:03 - 13:33   

  2. Examined at 13:11 to see 50% detachment.  

  3. Examined at 13:18 to see 80% detachment.  

7\. Neutralised with    2      dPBS and combined cell suspension.

8\. Centrifuged at 650 x g for 5 min.

  1. Start/Finish time for centrifugation was   13:37 - 13:42     




9\. Aspirated the supernatant(s).

10\. Resuspended pellet(s) in    1   mL       growth   media

11\. Aliquoted     10uL     of resuspended cells into a microcentrifuge tube
for cell count.

12\. Performed a cell count using the haemocytometer and recorded the cell
count data in the Google Doc spreadsheet called 'Cell Count Spreadsheet' (see
link below):

SSIBtIylyrBQE5kRX5Z8NtI/edit#gid=0

  1. Total cell number was:     216000      

  2. Volume of cell suspension required for subculture was:      1mL       

  3. Cell density per vessel:    7,000/cm2     




13\. Transferred      1    ml of cell suspension to the pre-warmed       4
mL Growth media

14\. Transferred cell suspension into the    T25  vessel.  

16\. Transferred vessel(s) to incubate at: 14:10

  * [X]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (avian cells)

Observations/Summary:  

KUZCO20 Fibroblasts passaged from 6 well plate to T25 flask.




### Results:

  * Results were;
    * [ x]  As Usual (this is a repetitive task)
    * [ ]  Unexpected because...
    * [ ]  Need to be further analysed
    * [ ]  Other (.......)
