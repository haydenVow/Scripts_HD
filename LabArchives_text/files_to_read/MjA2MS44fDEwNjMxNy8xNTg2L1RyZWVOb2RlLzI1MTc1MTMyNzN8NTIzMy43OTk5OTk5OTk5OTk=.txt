RELATED TO MILESTONE: Milestone 3: Expand 3 x clones from WCB2 vials on
microcarriers in the biostat A for 10 x doublings

AIM/PURPOSE: To optimize the MuSC culture process in the Biostat A 2 L.

HYPOTHESIS: That the Biostat A 2 L setup, seeding, monitoring and harvesting
processes are sub-optimal and unfit for production use. That incremental
improvments by raid (weekly) iteration can yield the optimizations required to
make the processes fit for production use.

RESULTS SUMMARY: This should only be completed if the data can be visualised
with a single graph/image, otherwise simply state "See Report".

CONCLUSIONS: What were the overall findings? This should be a concise summary
and not duplicate the information in the results/report. For example "We found
that Bovine MuSCs could only achieve a cell density 50% of that observed with
planar culture without undergoing precocious differentiation. These results
mean that we are currently limited to X cells/ml in suspension culture until
we find a way to inhibit precocious differentiation"

NEXT STEPS: This should be a dot point list of any immediate outcomes, changes
to SOPs, as well as providing a direct link to any new experiments arising
from these findings. Importantly, this section should also include any
potential DEPLOYMENTS to the production team
