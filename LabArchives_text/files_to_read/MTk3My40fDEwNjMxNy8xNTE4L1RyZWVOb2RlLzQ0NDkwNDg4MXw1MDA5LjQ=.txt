1\. Prepared   2400 uL  PBST (0.2% Triton-X)

2\. Prepared  2400 uL  blocking buffer: PBST (0.1% Triton-X + PBS) + 3% bovine
serum albumin (BSA). (Kept in the fridge until needed in blocking step)

3\. Prepared Primary Antibody Mix: :  10 µL   Primary #1 MyoG (Santa Cruz)
(1:200) +  40 µL   Primary #2 MF20 (DSHB)   (1:50) +   1950  uL Blocking
Buffer

Pipette-mixed antibody mix and stored refrigerated away from light until
needed.

Process:

Permeabilise

1\. Removed PBS from each well.

2\. Added  100 µL PBST (0.2% Triton-X) to each well for 15 min:  13:18 - 13:34  

3\. Aspirated PBST for each well.




Blocking

1\. Added  100 µL of blocking buffer (3% BSA in PBST [0.1% Triton-X]) and
incubate for 45 minutes - 1hr at RT. (no more than 1 hour):   13:36 - 14:27




Single/Simultaneous Primary Antibody staining

1\. Removed blocking buffer from each well.

2\. Incubated cells with primary antibody ~~for 90min - 2hrs at RT, or  ~~4ºC
overnight:   14:28

3\. Parafilmed plates and stored at 4ºC in tissue culture lab Fridge.

After this step, all further task should be performed in a dark room. The
vessel should also be wrapped foil when not used.

Observations/Summary:

\- Primary stained cells for MyoG and Myosin Heavy Chain

\- Stained n=4 from conditions that were the most promising (1, 3, 5 & 11),
EPL serum-control and EPL ACF-media control

  




### Results:

  * Results were;
    * [ ]  As Usual (this is a repetitive task)
    * [ ]  Unexpected because...
    * [x ]  Need to be further analysed
    * [ ]  Other (.......)
