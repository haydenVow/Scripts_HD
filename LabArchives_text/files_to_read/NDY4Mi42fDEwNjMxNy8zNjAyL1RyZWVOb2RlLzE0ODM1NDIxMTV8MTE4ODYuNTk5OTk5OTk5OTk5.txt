Process

1\. Image cells at 10x magnification

For 6 well plates

2\. Removed  1.5mL of media from each well of the 6-well plates.

3\. Replaced with   1.5 mL (6-well plates)

4\. Returned vessel to incubate at: timestamp 12:13  

  * [x]  37ºC, 5% CO2  OR [x]  30ºC, 5% CO2  (see table bellow)

For 24 well plates (Note: I'm worried about losing cells which is why I've
only said to remove/replace 0.350mL

  1. Removed  0.350mL of media from each well of the 24-well plates a. Please remove media by aspirating from the surface, avoid tilting the plate.
  2. Replaced with   0.350 mL (24-well plates) 
  3. Returned vessel to incubate at: timestamp 12:17  

    * [x]  37ºC, 5% CO2  OR [x]  30ºC, 5% CO2  (see table bellow)

Observation:

  

7755: Accidentally dropped plate in the incubator and all the media spelt out.
The lid was also opened slightly for around 3 seconds as this happened.
Replaced media and took new images. Upon observing again, a lot less of the
floating cells (red blood cells?) were visible. However observed adhered cells
on the outskirt of the well.  

After speaking with Bonnie, Kylie thew out the plate to prevent risk of
contamination.

  

7721: has a lot of cells. somewhat patchy. some areas have confluencey ranging
between 65 - 85% and some <30%
