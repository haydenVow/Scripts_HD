Prepare materials for thaw and seed:

  * NOTE: IF PERFORMING A THAW FROM A CLONAL MCB_2 OR WCB_2, PREPARE AT LEAST ONE EXTRA 96 WELL PLATE FOR A DIFFERENTIATION ASSAY. THIS IS AN IMPORTANT QUALITY CONTROL STEP WHILE WE BUILD OUR CLONAL CELL BANK.
  * Suggested layout for diff assay (please refer to previous diff assays for exact seeding, feeding and analysis procedures)  

  * 

1\. Gelatin coated  1 WELL OF 1 X 6-WELL PLATE with sterile filtered 0.1%
gelatin solution and then incubated all coated flasks at 37ºC

  * Time when all flasks placed into the incubator  13:40 pm 

2\. Aliquotted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then
placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath for a minimum of 20 minutes
prior to use:

  *  Growth media (for seeding):    2 x 60mL  

  * Time that aliquot was placed in the water bath to warm before use:  13 :44 pm 

  




## Thaw and seed vial:

  

Location where cryovial was collected from:

Vial details:  1 x KUZCO20  cryovials at   ~3,000,000  cells each for a total
of ~3,000,000 cells

Brew

Tower/Bucket # 5

Box/Cane # 2

Legacy ID: 3319-Culture-7660-Vial-2of9  
New ID: 11103-FrzCul-7660-Vial-2of9  

3. `Collected cryovial from LN2. Placed vial in Beadbath for 8 minutes: `` 14:05 - 14:13 pm `

`4. Ethanol sprayed & transferred the vial(s) to the BSC.`

`5.  Added  200µL of Growth Media (to generate a total volume of 1.2mL in the
cryovial) to the cryovial, resuspended the cell suspension gently to reduce
osmotic shock. `

`6. Collected the entire 1mL of cell suspension & transfer into the pre-warmed
tube of Growth Media. `

`7. Using a 25mL serological pipette, resuspended & distributed the cells
evenly in the   60 mL of pre-warmed Growth Media (prepared in Step 2). `

`8.  Transfered  30 mL to the non-coated  2 x T75 flasks (30mL each)  well,
allow to rest at 37C at RT for 45 min   14:19 - 15:04 pm```

`````9. After 45 minutes, transfer the supernatant to the gelatin-coated  2 x
T75 flasks (30mL each) and replace the growth media on the ````original ```` 2
x T75 flasks (30mL each) (non-gelatin-coated).`````

`10. Allow gelatin-coated flasks to sit still at RT for 15 min.   15:09 -
15:24 pm  
`

`10. Transfered flask/plate(s) to incubate at:  
`

  * [ X]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (aviary cells)

  

Making labels

Note - You will need to increase the passage number by one. (i.e. if your
thawed vial ID has a passage number of 3, when you make a culture ID for you
vessel you will need change the passage number to 4 on Airtable.)

Summary:

KUZCO20 Raw isolate cells were thawed into 2 x T175s (pre-plated, fibroblasts)
and the supernatant was seeded onto 2 x gelatin-coated T175 flasks
(MuSC+fibroblasts).
