AIM/PURPOSE: Cells did not adhere in a previous experiment due to lack of
attachment sites. In this study we aim to identify a suitable matrix for cells
to adhere and differentiate inside alginate hydrogels.

HYPOTHESIS: A combination of gel stiffness and RGD binding sites can provide
encapsulated cells with a suitable environment to promote adhesion and
differentiation.

RESULTS SUMMARY:

no cell spreading was observed, potentially due to diffusion of RGD peptide
out of the alginate network before cells could take advantage of the binding
sites.

CONCLUSIONS:

The Hypothesis was not supported and no changes in protein expression were
achieved, cell adhesion still has to be improved before significant changes in
maturation can be expected.

  * The addition of RGD peptide to the alginate matrix does not enable cells to adhere and differentiate regardless of gel stiffness (1% vs 2%). 
  * Microscopy analysis after viability stain did not indicate cell adhesion and gels were hard to image due to lack of transparency and overwhelming cell numbers

NEXT STEPS:

  * To improve adhesion and subsequently maturation, we will need to include as an additional component to the alginate matrix:
    * growth factors 
    * fibroblasts
    * covalently anchored RGD or other peptide sequences to promote adhesion
