### Process:

1\. Took 3 images of culture 12180 to assess confluence. Morphology of cells
was quite stretched and cells were far apart. May indicate signs of
senescence.




4\. Removed vessel(s) from the incubator  

5\. Washed the vessel(s) with dPBS (room temp)

6\. Added     10    mL 1x Tryple-edta (room temp) to each vessel/well and
incubated at 30ËšC for 8 minutes,.  

7\. Neutralised with     10mL     dPBS and combined cell suspension into 1 x
50mL    tube.

8\. Centrifuged at 500 x g for 5 min.




9\. Aspirated the supernatant(s).

10\. Resuspended pellet(s) in     3    mL     dPBS     media.

11\. Aliquoted     20uL     of resuspended cells into a microcentrifuge tube
for cell count.

12\. Performed a cell count using the haemocytometer and recorded the cell
count data in the Google Doc spreadsheet: Cell Count Spreadsheet.

Total cell number was:    4,380,000  

Aliquoted 2.19mL of cell suspension (3.2x10^6 cells) into a 15mL tube for the
following experiment https://au-

* * *

Decided to seed one T175 flask for continuous culture, 30mL of growth media
was added to the remaining cell suspension (1.18x10^6 cells).

T175 flask was placed in incubator 140 to incubate at 30 degrees, 5% CO2.
