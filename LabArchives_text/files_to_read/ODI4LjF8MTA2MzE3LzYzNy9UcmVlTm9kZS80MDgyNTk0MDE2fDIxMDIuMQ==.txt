DAPI and AF488 images taken on the Zaber at 5x magnification were processed
using the attached ImageJ macros.

Note: in the files attached, 'old macro' refers to image processing performed
using MIA. The analysis and graphs from the old macro are not shown here as
this macro was initially made for processing 10x images captured using the
Axio microscope. Instead data from processing images through the 'new macros'
is shown on this page. The overall conclusion from the two methods was the
same.




DAPI counts and MyoG counts were used to calculate the percentage of MyoG
positive cells in Excel. This data was then entered into GraphPad Prism for
analysis. No outliers were identified using ROUT's method (Q=2%).

There was a significant difference (p<0.05) in MyoG% in cells differentiated
in 2% HS versus E6 (for both E6 made fresh and E6 made from frozen bullet). E6
frozen bullet resulted in significantly lower percentage of MyoG positive
cells compared to E6 made from fresh.

Representative composite images from each condition are shown below:
