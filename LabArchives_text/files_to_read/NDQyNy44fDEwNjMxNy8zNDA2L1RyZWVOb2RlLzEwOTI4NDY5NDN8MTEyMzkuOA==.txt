Growth Medium: DMEM + 10% FBS + 1xP/S + 1:100 anti-clumping agent




Process:

  1. Aliquoted:
    1. 30 mL of DMEM + 10% FBS + 1xP/S (we are almost out of this medium but these cultures will be moved to a different medium later this week so no need to make more)   

    2. Added 300 uL of Anti-Clumping Agent to aliquot 
      1. Placed in water bath:  13:05     

  2. Paused shakers by pressing the "play" button on the controller on the side wall of the incubator
  3. Collected culture vessel from shaker, wiped with ethanol-sprayed cloth and brought into BSC
  4. Pipetted suspensions though 70 um cell strainer into 2 x 50 mL tubes
  5. Centrifuged at 300 x g for 5 min. Timestamp: : - :
  6. Aspirated 15 mL of supernatant from each culture, taking care to not disrupt or aspirate pellet 
  7. Re-suspended cultures using serelogical.
  8. Took 1 x 500 uL sample from 15 mL cell suspension and followed procedure in entry below to count cells.
  9. Replaced with 15 mL of fresh, warmed media per culture 
  10. Gently pipette-mixed cultures again before moving back to E125 flasks
  11. Returned vessel to incubator and replaced in clamp. Pressed "play" at side of incubators. Timestamp: :

  * Incubator (#68), Lab [Main/Library/Production]



  1. Prepared stain buffers
    1. Made enough Hoechst/PI buffer to stain 15 samples, 300 uL per sample (5 mL):
    2. Filtered 11 mL dPBS to remove any debris, used 0.2 or 0.45 um pore size syringe filter
    3. Combined the following:
      1. 5 mL of filtered dPBS 
      2. 5 drops (~50 uL) of NucBlue Live Cell Stain ReadyProbes Hoechst 33342
      3. 250 uL of Propidium Iodide 1 mg/mL solution
    4. Combined the following:
      1. 5 mL of filtered dPBS 
      2. 5 drops (~50 uL) of NucBlue Live Cell Stain ReadyProbes Hoechst 33342
      3. 5 drops (~50 uL) of NucGreen Dead 488 Cell Stain ReadyProbes Sytox Green
  2. Took 0.5 mL sample from culture 14 :00    

  3. Prepared 3 wells in a 96 well plate, each containing:
    1. 20 uL of sample from culture
    2. 80 uL of stain buffer
  4. Incubated culture in stain for 10-20 minutes (signal intensified as incubation time increased) at room temperature in the dark  14:03 - 14:15   

  5. Centrifuged the 96 well plate at 650 RCF for 1 minute.  
  6. Took phase contrast, blue fluorescence and red fluorescence micrographs of each well
  7. Counted total cells (blue fluorescent nuclei, stained with Hoechst33342) and dead cells (red fluorescent nuclei, stained with propidium iodide OR green fluorescent nuclei, stained with Sytox green)
