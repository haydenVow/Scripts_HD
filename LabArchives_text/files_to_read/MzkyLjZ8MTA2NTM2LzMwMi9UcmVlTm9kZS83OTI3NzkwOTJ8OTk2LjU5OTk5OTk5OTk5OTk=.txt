Experiment Plan:

  




Procedure - 100% Treatment with VitC

  1. Turn on the water bath and set to 37'C.
  2. Aliquot required growth media into a sterile container/s and add Vitamin C (aka LAA2P) [stock concentration 100mg/mL] to a working concentration of 50ug/mL in growth media i.e. 500uL per 1L of media.
  3. Place in the water bath and heat for at least 20 minutes. 
  4. Transfer flasks to the BSC, wiping with 70% EtOH. Discard media from the flask. 
  5. Replace selected flasks (Sets 4 and 5) with Treated media. Return to incubate and note the Flask ID. 

  

  


Set 2: 100% Treatment with VitC (50ug/mL)


All flasks seeded in normal media were imaged and estimated to be between
60-80% confluent (many of them quite patchy in areas closer to the neck of the
flask).


Set 5: 50% Feed + VitC (50ug/mL)


Flasks seeded in Vit C were imaged and estimated to be 80-90% confluent.
(definitely more confluent than those seeded without Vit C).
