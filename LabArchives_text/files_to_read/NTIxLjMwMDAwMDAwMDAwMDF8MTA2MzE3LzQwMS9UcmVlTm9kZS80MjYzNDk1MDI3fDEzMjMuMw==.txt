Aim:

To assess cell adhesion of DOLLY12 MuSCs on nanofibrous zein and gelatin
scaffolds provided by Gelatex  

# Hypothesis:

DOLLY12 MuSC cells will adhere well (D1 proliferation) and maintain adherence
to gelatex zein and gelatin scaffolds at seeding densities of 0.7, 1 and 2M
cells/sample (96-well size pieces) after 7 days in ACF E6 differentiation
media.

# Technical Gap:

In previous experiments we have seen good cellular adhesion (DOLLY12 MuSCs) to
our in-house zein scaffolds immediately following cell seeding in serum
containing media and ACF media (see here). However, we have not yet tested
gelatex zein scaffolds, or gelatex gelatin scaffolds.




DoE Full Factorial Design:

12 conditions (n=4) = 48 samples

Categorical factor = scaffolds (zein or gelatin)

Categorical factor = scaffold wetness (wet or dry)

Continuous factor = seeding density (0.7M, 1M or 2M per scaffold)

0.7M (n=16) = 11.2M

1M (n=16) = 16M  
2M (n=16) = 32M  
  
= 59.2M total ACF cells needed (+ room for error = 63M)  
  
  

  

Extras samples will include serum controls seeded at 1M each:  
Gelatin, Wet (n=4)

Gelatin, Dry (n=4)

Zein, Wet (n=4)

Zein, Dry (n=4)

= 16 total serum control samples = 16M cells needed. (+room for error = 19M)
