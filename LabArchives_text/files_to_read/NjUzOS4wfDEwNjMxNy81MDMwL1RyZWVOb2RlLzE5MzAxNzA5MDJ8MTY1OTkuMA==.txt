Lab Archives. Please complete the Link to Clubhouse, Aims and Hypothesis
BEFORE you begin the experiment.

At the completion of any EPIC please do the following:  
1\. Ensure all sections of this page are complete  
2\. Email a link to this page to the project leader  
3\. Project leaders will then review all information and digitally sign this
page (click the screwdriver and wrench icon in the top right of this page)  
4\. Project leaders should then send a link to the signed page to James Ryall

RELATED TO MILESTONE:  

## KR1: Develop a QMS-compliant serum-free media that supports 20+ doublings
of our chosen species in suspension

KR4: Establish and run a suspension pipeline at a rate of 10,000 clones per
month.

AIM/PURPOSE: To compare how well liquids are mixed in 24 deep well plates and
96 well plates on the MaxQ shaker versus the Infors shaking incubator.

HYPOTHESIS: Cultures will be mixed better on the Infors shaking incubator than
on MaxQ shaker. This will be compared by recording videos to observe the wave
height and whether the wells are mixed down to the bottom.

RESULTS SUMMARY: "See Report".

CONCLUSIONS: The hypothesis was supported. Slow-motion videos were captured
that show the differences in wave height and whether the wells are mixed down
to the bottom on both shakers.

NEXT STEPS:

The shaking incubator we have is a demo unit. Therefore, the next steps would
be to draft a purchase request for this incubator (or similar product from a
different brand).

Try fast adaptation or media optimisation experiments for suspension cultures
in 24 deep well plates and 96 well plates. Compare these to 50 mL shake tubes
and E125 flasks (EPIC27984).
