Observations

Culture 8144 is currently in a T75 flask. These cells are from the CHOMP9
biopsy, initially digested with Collagenase and Dispase at 30C. One portion of
these cells was initially cultured in DMEM/F12 based media, which the other
portion was cultured in M199 based media. The culture in DMEM/F12 performed
much better and has already been banked as an MCB. Culture 8144 is derrived
from the isolate culture in M199 based media and has not performed as well.
While these cells are now nearly confluent, it was decided to terminate these
cells today as they are not proliferating as well as their counterpart in
grown in DMEM/F12. We have plenty of cells banked from the DMEM/12 culture and
also have an MCB of trypsin digested cells.
