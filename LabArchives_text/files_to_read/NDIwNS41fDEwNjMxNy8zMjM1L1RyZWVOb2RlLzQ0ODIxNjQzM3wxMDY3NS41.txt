Procedure
  
  
Test 1

  1. Took 0.5 mL sample from culture 7466  14:41 
  2. Prepared stain buffer:
    1. 1 mL of lysis solution
    2. 1 drop of NucBlue Live Cell Stain ReadyProbes Hoechst 33342
    3.  ~~2~~ 5 uL of Propidium Iodide
  3. Centrifuged 0.5 mL sample at 650 RCF for 5 minutes
  4. Aspirated 450 uL of supernatant and resuspended in 450 uL of dPBS
  5. Centrifuged 0.5 mL sample at 650 RCF for 5 minutes 14:53 - 14:58
  6. Aspirated 450 uL of supernatant and resuspended in 450 uL of stain buffer
  7. Vortexed for 60 seconds at maximum power 15:00
  8. Incubated for 10 minutes at room temperature in the dark 15:01 - 15:11
  9. Vortexed the sample briefly to resuspend nuclei and loaded 10 uL sample into a hemocytometer for counting.
  10. No nuclei were observed so the sample was centrifuged to concentrate down to 50 uL.
  11. Still no nuclei were observed; either the sample was too dilute or the nuclei had been lost throughout sample processing.

Repeated protocol with flask 7505 due to cell suspension being too dilute in
culture 7466

  1. Took 0.5 mL sample from culture 7505  15:21
  2. Centrifuged 0.5 mL sample at 650 RCF for 5 minutes 15:22 - 15:27
  3. Aspirated 450 uL of supernatant and resuspended in 450 uL of dPBS
  4. Centrifuged 0.5 mL sample at 650 RCF for 5 minutes 15:30 - 15:35
  5. Aspirated 450 uL of supernatant and resuspended in 450 uL of stain buffer
  6. Vortexed for 60 seconds at maximum power 15:37
  7. Incubated for 10 minutes at room temperature in the dark 15:38 - 15:48
  8. Vortexed the sample briefly to resuspend nuclei and loaded 10 uL sample into a hemocytometer for counting.
  9. Took phase contrast, blue fluorescence and red fluorescence micrographs of the sample.
  10. No PI staining seen, so added 22.5 uL of PI to sample to make up to 50 uL/mL PI. Incubated for further 10 mins. 15:57 - 16:07
  11. Took phase contrast, blue fluorescence and red fluorescence micrographs of the sample.
