This is only a rough platemap based on pre-seeding. Will need to update
shortly. Please feed all wells.  

  

  

  




Process:

  1. Aliquotted   18 mL  mL of  E6 Media  (Note that E6 media that has been aliquoted is for multiple experiments)
  2. Placed in water bath   15:01    

  3. Removed plate from the incubator and place in BSC (lights off)
  4. Remove parafile from plate. 
  5. Carefully remove  100 % of supernatant from each well with a p1000. See tips below:
    1. You can use the same tip across the samples containing cells, however switch tips for the control. Refer to plate map for the position. 
    2. Place tip on the side of the well and slowly aspirate
    3. Be careful not to touch or suck up the gel
    4. Tilting the plate slightly may help, however try not to dislodge the gel from the inserts
  6. Replaced with  1.5 mL (per well/per vessel) of  E6  media. 
    1. Slowly release the media onto the side of the well and NOT directly on the gel.  
  7. Parafilm plate and return vessel to incubate at: 15:34

### Observations/Summary:

 100 % media changed on vessel(s)

  1. 8024  
  
There was no parafilm on the plate when it was removed from the incubator.
Plate was parafilmed and placed back into the incubator after the feed.  
\- Media was yellow for all the wells in columns 1-4 (A1,B1,C1,D1, A2, A3, A4,
B4). Remainder were pink.
