  1. Prepare CMFDA solution
    1. 50ug tube, quik-spin
    2. Add 50uL DMSO and resuspend
  2. Prepare live/dead stain in DMEM (started live dead stain at 12:00pm, took off at 12:30pm)
    * 15 mL DMEM (ID: S3111)
    * 30 uL CMFDA (ID:914)
    * 15 uL propidium iodide 1ug/mL final concentration (ID: 6317)
  3. Divide volume between x2 falcon tubes each evenly, label one 'Live-dead' and label the second 'phalloidin'. Return 'phalloidin' to incubation at 30°C 
    * To stain Live/Dead tube:
      * Pellet 'live-dead' falcon tube by centrifuging at 300xg for 5 minutes
      * Aspirate supernatant and resuspend pellet in 1mL live/dead stain and incubate in falcon tube in incubator at 30°C for 30 minutes
      * Pellet tube by centrifugation at 300xg for 5 minutes to remove stain
      * Aspirate stain from pellet and resuspend in 1mL DPBS
      * Pellet  tube by centrifugation at 300xg for 5 minutes to remove DPBS
      * Resupend in 1mL DPBS and cell count
      * Place into 96-well plate x3 wells at x number of cells per well 
  4. Aspirate media from wells to live stain
  5. DPBS rinse twice, 1mL per well
  6. Add 0.5mL stain to each well, incubate at 30°C for 30 minutes
  7. Remove plate from incubator
  8. Aspirate stain and rinse stained and unstained wells with 1mL DPBS each, 3 times
  9. Prepare phalloidin stain solution, total required: 15mL 
    * 3% BSA 0.1% Triton-X 100 
    * 1:1000 phalloidin
    * 1:1000 DAPI 
  10. To fix/stain plate (fixing finished at 12:55pm)
    * Fix all wells with 1mL per well ice-cold 4% PFA for 20 minutes
    * Dispose of PFA in separate waste stream. Remove PFA from wells and rinse 3 times with DPBS
    * Rinse wells with DPBS 1mL/well, remove
    * Permeabilise plate 1mL PBS-T per well for 20 minutes
    * Do not label cells which have been stained with live/dead stain. Label wells with phalloidin and DAPI 0.5mL per well and incubate for 30 minutes
    * Remove stain and rinse 3x DPBS 1mL per well
    * Add 1mL DPBS per well
    * Parafilm plate and foil. Store at 4°C until ready for imaging
  11. To stain tube: (started phalloidin staining at 4:15pm)
    * Pellet phalloidin tube (in PBS) 300xg for 5 minutes 
    * Resuspend in 1mL per well ice-cold 4% PFA for 20 minutes
    * Pellet phalloidin tube 300xg for 5 minutes to remove PFA
    * Resuspend phalloidin tube in 1mL PBS 
    * Pellet phalloidin tube (in PBS) 300xg for 5 minutes to remove DPBS (and residual PFA)
    * Resuspend phalloidin tube in PBS-T and incubate for 10 minutes
    * Pellet phalloidin tube 300xg for 5 minutes to remove PBS-T
    * Add 1mL staining solution and resuspend. Incubate for 30 minutes covered from light
    * Pellet phalloidin tube 300xg for 5 minutes to remove stain
    * Resuspend in 1mL DPBS and perform cell count
    * Place into 96-well plate x3 wells at x number of cells per well
    * Parafilm plate and foil. Store at 4°C until ready for imaging
