RELATED TO MILESTONE:  KR2 - Increase late stage maturation markers by 10x
compared to non-stimulated baseline

AIM/PURPOSE: To assess the effect of selected continuous electrical
stimulation profiles on myoblast differentiation and maturation

HYPOTHESIS: We identified a suitable voltage range and stimulation profile to
affect cellular behaviour. we also hypothesize that continuous stimulation
will benefit cell maturation (as opposed to some reports which take advantage
of work-rest periods, see final report introduction)

RESULTS SUMMARY:

  
  
Total Protein analysis of various stimulated culturesLaminin-precoated C2C12
culture differentiated under 5.4V stimulationGelatin-precoated C2C12 culture
differentiated under 3.4V stimulation  
Gelatin-precoated C2C12 culture differentiated (electrode control (no stim)  
  
  
CONCLUSIONS:  The hypothesis is not supported, as evidenced by the lack of
significant differences in protein expression and cell phentotypes observed
between stimulated and unstimulated conditions. This might be due to
suboptimal stimulation profiles chosen or the start of e-stim at the wrong
time in the maturation cycle.

NEXT STEPS:

  * Normalize above Bradford data to cell number for quantitative comparison
  * build a new lid prototype to increase throughput of e-stim studies (24w format with 6 replicates per condition)
  * revisit literature for more suitable stimulation conditions (PulsePal2 is ordered and will allow us to study work-rest periodic stimulation)
  * investigate the effect of early e-stim on cell alignment and fusion index
