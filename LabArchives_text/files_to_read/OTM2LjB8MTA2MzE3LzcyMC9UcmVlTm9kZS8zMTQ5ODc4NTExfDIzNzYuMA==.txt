Process

  1. Prepare OT2 for mixing protocol
    1. Add `14mL` of `"DMEM/F12"` to wells 1 and 2 of a 12 well reservoir.
    2. Add `1.2mL`of 50x E6 bullet to A3 of the stock plate.
      1. 120 uL of 500x E6 bullet + 1.080 mL of "DMEM/F12"
  2. Immediately prior to running the OT2 mixing protocol, use a multichannel pipette to thoroughly mix the working stocks by pipetting the solutions up and down 5-10 times within their respective wells.  DO NOT MIX THE WORKING STOCKS WITH EACH OTHER!
  3. Run the following OT2 mixing protocol to make DSD conditions (attached).
    1. start run: 4:23:30 PM
    2. run time: 03:07:27
  4.  ~~While the OT2 mixing protocol is running, prepare controls and warm in waterbath at 37 degrees:~~
    1.  ~~4 mL DMEM/F12 + 2% HS + 1x P/S~~
    2.  ~~4 mL E6 (x0.2 P/S) made from fresh~~
    3.  ~~4 mL E6 (x0.2 P/S) made from bullet~~
  5.  ~~Once the OT2 mixing protocol is completed, add`1.266mL`of each control to the stock plate in the following arrangement:~~
    *  ~~2% HS control in wells H11 and C12~~
    *  ~~fresh E6 control in wells A12 and D12~~
    *  ~~E6 bullet control in wells B12 and ~~~~~~E12~~~~
  6. Cover the stock plate with adhesive sealing mat, wrap with foil, and store in the fridge (4Â° C).
