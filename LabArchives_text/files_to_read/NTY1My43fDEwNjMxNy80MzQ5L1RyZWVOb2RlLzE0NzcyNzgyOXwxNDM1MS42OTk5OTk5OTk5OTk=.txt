Aim/Purpose


To confirm that DOLLY12 and CHOMP fibroblasts in CD CHO basal medium can adapt
to suspension


Hypothesis


That DOLLY12 and CHOMP fibroblasts will adapt to suspension in CD CHO basal
medium conditions as shown by previous experiments

D0: Seed cells to suspension culture in 50mL culture tubes and E125 flasks

Thaw F_DOLLY12 and F_CHOMP into T175 flasks. For each cell type, 6x50mL shake
culture tubes and 6xE125 flasks will be seeded with a total of 3M (500,000
each) and 18M cells (3M each) from initial adherent cultures respectively.

6x 50 mL culture tubes and 6x E125 flasks will be split into the following
conditions:

  1. DOLLY12_F in 5 mL (3x culture tubes) and  30 mL (3x E125s) CD CHO +10% Knockout serum replacement + 1:100 anti-clumping agent + 4mM L-glutamine +  100ng/mL each FGF, IGF1, PDGF \+ 1x p/s
  2. DOLLY12_F in 5 mL (3x culture tubes) and  30 mL (3x E125s) DMEM/F12 + 10% FBS + 1x p/s
  3. CHOMP_F in 5 mL (3x culture tubes) and  30 mL (3x E125s) CD CHO +10% Knockout serum replacement + 1:100 anti-clumping agent + 4mM L-glutaminne +  100ng/mL each FGF, IGF1, PDGF \+ 1x p/s
  4. CHOMP_F in 5 mL (3x culture tubes) and  30 mL (3x E125s) DMEM/F12 + 10% FBS + 1x p/s

Feed

Perform 100% media changes every 4 days by centrifuging cell suspensions at
300xg for 5 minutes, discard the supernatant and resuspend cells in their
respective growth medias. Take 100 uL of resuspended sample for imaging and
cell counts.  

Cell counts

Transfer 100 uL sample to a 96 well-plate. Add 100 uL of stain buffer (Hoechst
33342 Readyflow) to the cells and incubate at room temperature and in the dark
for 30 minutes. Prepare serial dilutions (50%, 25%, 12.5%) of the stained cell
preparation in subsequent wells, diluting with dPBS. Image all wells using the
Zaber and analyse using MIA.
