## Objective: To have our GEN1 product fibroblasts in a 2L benchtop
bioprocess, ready for hand-off to a third party.

GEN1 product indicates all QMS requirements have been adhered to, thus we must
be working with croc or wallaby. "Ready for hand-off" indicates clonal
fibroblasts must be growing in suspension, in ACF media.

James & Lisa are running the project associated with QMS; we just need to make
sure that we pay attention to the changes that they are rolling out across the
science team & we need to make sure everything associated with the croc &
wallaby fibroblasts is extremely well documented.  
  

## KR1: Develop a QMS-compliant serum-free media that supports 20+ doublings
of our chosen species in suspension

The focus of this KR is development of a cell-line that is adapted to
suspension, then optimising the media to support 20+ doublings as well as
doubling rates faster than 48 hours. This media should ultimately be ACF
(hopefully this will be not too challenging given our recent findings around
KSR & the promising results with suspension adaptation in Q3). The cells
should also be transferred to a 2L bioreactor.  

  * 0.25 - Fibroblasts from our chosen species double 2.5x in media containing less than 2% serum.

  * 0.5 - Fibroblasts from our chosen species survive 3x passages in media containing less than 2% serum.

  * 0.75 - Fibroblasts from our chosen species double 5x in suspension, in media containing less than 2% serum.

  * 0.9 - Fibroblasts from our chosen species double 20+ times in suspension, in media containing less than 2% serum in a 2L bioreactor.

  * 1.0 - Fibroblasts from our chosen species double 20+ times in suspension, in serum-free media, in a 2L bioreactor, with an average doubling time of <48hrs.  
  

### KR2: Characterise 2 x QMS-compliant suspension-adapted fibroblast clones
from our chosen species

Cloning could theoretically happen before or after suspension adaptation. In
Q4, we may do 1 x cloning run for adherent croc fibroblasts, but we should
focus our efforts on developing a pipeline for SCC of suspension adapted
fibroblasts. In addition, we will need to start early to identify potential
partners to support us with genetic characterisation.  

  * 0.25 - Cloning is completed for >1500 QMS-compliant fibroblasts.

  * 0.5 - 2 x QMS-compliant fibroblast clones have achieved 40+ doublings without a decrease in mean doubling time and are banked at the WCB_2 level.

  * 0.75 - Have 1 x QMS-compliant fibroblast clone growing in suspension.

  * 0.9 - Have 2 x QMS-compliant fibroblast clones growing in suspension.

  * 1.0 - Have partnered with someone to determine the genetic differences between top-performing clones and the heterogenous population they were sorted from to "verify" immortality.  
  
  

### KR3: Process and bank all biopsies to QMS requirements and have >50 vials
of wallaby/crocodile fibroblast WCB in LN2

>50 vials indicates that production will not run out of croc/wallaby when and
if they need to grow up large numbers of these cells to feed investors.  

  * 0.25 - Process biopsies from all animals that arrive at Vow
  * 0.5 - Isolate viable fibroblast cells from croc & wallaby.
  * 0.75 - Generate an MCB for both croc & wallaby.
  * 1.0 - Generate a WCB for both croc & wallaby.  
  

KR4: Establish and run a suspension pipeline at a rate of 10,000 clones per
month.

  * 0.25 - Achieve capability to analyse 80 clones/samples per month (establish pipeline)
  * 0.5 - 400 clones/samples per month
  * 0.75 - 2000 clones/samples per month
  * 1.0 - 10000 clones/samples per month

### Team A

Team A is responsible for generating new fibroblast lines, adapting these
fibroblast lines to suspension using the "fast adaptation" method, and
continuously increasing the speed and scale of the adaptation process. Once
cells have been adapted to suspension, their culture conditions will be
optimized to maximize growth rate and minimize medium cost (this may not occur
until Q1 2022). The primary responsibility for each of these activities is
assigned to a member of team A, and that person will be assisted by each of
the other members in the team.
