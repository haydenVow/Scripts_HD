## Flask 12685 - Harvested:

1\. All 3886 million cells in flask 12685 were harvested for 2nd product
experiments

  

## Flask 12684 - Harvested and Passaged:

1\. 426.47 mL of RPMI and 426.47 mL of Hycell (852.94 mL total RPMI/Hycell)
was aliquoted into one 1000L bottle

2\. 426.47 mL of RPMI and 426.47 mL of Hycell (852.94 mL total RPMI/Hycell)
was aliquoted into another 1000L bottle

3\. 1.00 mL of IFG and 0.2mL of EGF was added two each 1000L bottle (2.00 mL
of IGF and 0.4mL of EGF total)

4\. The bottles with media and growth factors were placed into a water bath at
37 degrees for 20 minutes

5\. The media and growth factors from each bottle were placed into 1xE5000
flask each

6\. 147.06 mL of flask 12684 were aliquoted into each E5000 flask (total
volume 1000mL in each E5000)

7\. The 2xE5000 flasks were placed into shaker incubator 4:30pm (37 C, 5% CO2,
90 rpm)

8\. The remaining cells in 12684 were harvested for 2nd product experiments
