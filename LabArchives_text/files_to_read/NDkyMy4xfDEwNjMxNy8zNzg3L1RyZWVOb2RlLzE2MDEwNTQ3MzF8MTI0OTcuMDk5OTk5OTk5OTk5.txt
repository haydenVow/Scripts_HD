Observations:

\- Both plates were Zaber imaged and it appeared that cell liftoff and death
was starting to occur for a number of conditions

\- It was decided that plates would be fixed today before further death could
occur and stained for MyoG.

\- After consulting with Bec, a few problems with our differentiation assay
process was observed:

- Morphological analysis of the condiitons from days 2 and 5 is in the attachment, which showed better performance on the day 5 images, likely because they are more mature and have more distinct myotubes. 

1\. When feeding cells, aspirating all of the expended media leaves the cells
which can result in cell liftoff

2\. When seeding diff assay it should be seeded at 7000 and allow wells to
acheive confluence before switching to E6.
