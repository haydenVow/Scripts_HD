Process

  1. Placed 20 mL of growth media in the water bath at 37C 14:25  
  

  2. Culture vessels removed from the incubator 15:00   
  

  3. Each vessel was examined under the microscope and imaged at 10x and 20x magnifications. Observations were recorded in the table bellow  
  

  4. Removed 50% of the media from each well.    
  
  

  5. Replaced with pre-warmed growth media.  
  

  6. Culture vessels returned to library lab incubator 77, 37C and 5% CO2  15:23

6-well plate9695-WALLE06-Bennets Wallaby P2-1of1  
There some debris in the culture however the cells have retained a healthy,
fibroblast-like morphology

Cells do not have a healthy morphology. They have an enlarged nucleus, and
have lost their elongated morphology, now being more circular or triangular.
The borders of the cells are scrappy.

There some debris in the culture however the cells have retained a fibroblast-
like morphology. Cells are concentrated in the centre of the well.
