Make growth media

  1. DMEM/F12 + 20% FBS + 1x P/S + 10uM p38i
    1. 100 mL DMEM/F12 + 20% FBS + 1x P/S \+ 50 uL of 20mM p38i stock
  2. E810C (E89C + 50uM glyoxylic acid)
    1. Make 100mM glyoxylic acid stock by adding 0.092g to 10mL E89C. Syringe filter.
    2. Add 105 uL of glyoxylic acid stock to 210 mL of E89C

  

Equilibrate microcarriers in culture medium before use

  1. Mixed the stock microcarrier (20mg/mL) before aliquoting 13.6 mL/tube into 2x50 mL tubes labelled 'serum' and 'E810C'.
  2. The microcarriers were then allowed to settle and the supernatant (  7 mL) removed.  13:55 
  3. The microcarriers were resuspended in 3 mL of the respective growth media ~14:02 .
  4. Allowed the microcarriers to settle once again.
    1. While waiting added 23 mL/flask growth media to 4x E125 flasks.
  5. removed 6 mL of supernatant from tubes ~14:10 
  6. Resuspended microcarriers in 6.4 mL of growth media. Mixed and transferred all of the microcarrier suspension (7mL/tube) into 4x E125 flasks to make the total volume 30 mL in each flask.
  7. The culture vessels were transferred to the incubator (bottom Sanyo - 37 degrees C, 5% CO2) so that the microcarriers and culture medium could equilibrate.  14:31
