Batch No: 014

EPIC Number:  
Start date: 8/07/21  
End date: 5/08/21

### Batch goal(s)

Achieve 300g cell yield  
  

Determine whether:  
1\. Longer passage time improves final weight of the product.  
2\. Longer treatment time improves final weight of the product.  
3\. Higher Vitamin C treatment concentration improves final weight of the
product.  
4\. Treatment in E-flasks allows for improved aggregation (at constant
shaking, intermittent shaking, or static)

### Cell line

### Batch notes

At passage 3, the batch was divided into 2 with half flasks seeded in
commercial gibco media and the other half in Vow's in house powdered media
mix.

At passage 4, the flasks using Gibco media were transferred to Main Lab due to
space restrictions.
