Began passage of 2xT175 CHOMP07 flasks 13121 and 13122.

  1. Cells were washed with sterile filtered dPBS (aliquot 13297) 
  2. Wash was removed and cells were covered with 10mL of sterile filtered tryple-EDTA per flask (mix 13300). 
  3. Cells were incubated for 30 minutes at 5% CO2 for 10 minutes. 
  4. Cells were collected into 50mL tubes and flasks were washed down with equal volumes of dPBS to tryple 
  5. Washes were also collected to the same tubes 
  6. Cells were centrifuged at 650g for 5 minutes to pellet 
  7. Supernatant was discarded and cells were resuspended in 10mL of dPBS

10uL of cells were taken in dublicate for a trypan blue stain at a 1:2
dilution followed by a count under a hemocytometer. 5 quadrants were counted
and an average was taken between all counts.

Cells Count = 6,920,000, 5,720,000

Average count = 6,320,000 in 10mL

Decided to freeze cells at 1 million cells per mL in CryostorCS10 serum free
freeze media.

  1. Spun cells down at 650g for 5 minutes once more
  2. Removed supernatant 
  3. resuspended cells in 6.32mL of CryostorCS10 media (Stock ID 5337) 
  4. Aliquoted 1.05mL into 6 cryovials (ID' 15472-15477) 
  5. Moved cryovials to a Mr Frosty and placed them in a -80 freezer in library lab.
