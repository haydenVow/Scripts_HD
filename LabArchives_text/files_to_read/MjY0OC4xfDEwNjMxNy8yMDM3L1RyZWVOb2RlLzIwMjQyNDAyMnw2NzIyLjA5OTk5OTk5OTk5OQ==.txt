Process:

1\. Aliquotted  2.7 mL  mL of  each growth Media into  1 tube each  . Placed
in water bath   14:39 - 14:49

2\. Removed  50  % of supernatant from vessel.

3\. Replaced with  2.5 mL (per well/per vessel) of  resepective growth   media
(see table above).

4\. Returned vessel to incubate at:

  * [X]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (aviary cells)

  

  * Incubator (#Thermo  ), Lab [Main]




### Observations/Summary:

 50 % media changed on vessel(s)

7224, 7225, 7226.

  

No noticeable differences in the morphology or confluence between different
media conditions.
