Process:

  1. Warm 7 mL of growth media in the waterbath 12:25   

  2. Prepare 500 uL sterile filtered solution of PBS + Hoechst (1:1). Then, stain 2 columns of the 96 wp (12 wells/condition) with the following conditions:
    1. column 2 and 3: no stain (control)
    2. column 4 and 5: Hoechst stain with 4 uL/mL for 1 h (and then perform a 100% media change) 15:16 - 14:16  

    3. column 6 and 7: Hoechst stain with 4 uL/mL for 24 h
    4. column 8 and 9: Hoechst stain with 8 uL/mL for 1 h (and then perform a 100% media change) 15:16 - 14:16
    5. column 10 and 11: Hoechst stain with 8 uL/mL for 24 h
  3. The plate was incubated at 37 degrees C, 5% CO2 (incubator #68).
  4. Image the centre of each well on 5x, DAPI. Also image the whole well on DAPI and phase.
    1. DAPI exposure: 70
    2. Phase exposure: 30
  5. Returned plate to incubator 16:50




Observations/Summary:

Hoechst stained (with different concentrations and times) and imaged 96 well
plate:

#7878
