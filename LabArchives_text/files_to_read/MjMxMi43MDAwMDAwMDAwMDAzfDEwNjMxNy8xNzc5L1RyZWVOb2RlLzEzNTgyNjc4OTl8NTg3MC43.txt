## Feed performed by: Bec Screnci  




Growth Media:

  * [X ]  DMEM/F12 + 20% FBS + 1X P/S
  * [X ]  DMEM/F12 + 20% FBS + 1X P/S + 1:100 Anti-clumping agent
  * [X ]  DMEM/F12 + 20% FBS + 1X P/S + 1:500 Anti-clumping agent
  * [X ]  DMEM/F12 + 20% FBS + 1X P/S + 1:100 RevitaCell




Process:

1\. Place the pre-aliquotted  10 mL  mL of each respective type of Growth
Media into the water bath   9:35 am

2\. Placed shake tubes in centrifuge and centrifuge at 650 x g for 5 min at
RT.   11:07 am

Aspirated supernatant from each pellet

Added 1mL of respective growth media to each tube and used a P1000 pipette to
break up cell clumps.

Remaining 9mL of each respective media was added afterwards and triturated
with 10mL serological pipette to break up cell clumps for each culture further
and resuspend cells evenly.

4\. Returned 3 x vessel to incubate at:   11:23 am Shaking at 206 RPM

  * [X ]  37ÂºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * Incubator (#67 ), Lab [Library]

Note* counts collected from 1mL suspensions for 1:100 ACA and 1:100 RevitaCell
(to watch cell counts closely), but not for the others due to the long time
required for each count and it being a Saturday.

  

  

Serum - clear supernatant, 1 small irregularly shaped clump

1:100 ACA - cloudy supernatant, no clumps

1:500 ACA - cloudy supernatant, few small irregularly shaped clumps

1:100 RevitaCell - cloudy supernatant, 1 small irregularly shaped clump
