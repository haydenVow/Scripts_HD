## Electrode Lid Sterilisation

  1. The portable UV lamp (stored on the top shelf in the biomaterials area of the Main Lab) was sprayed down and brought into a BSC.
  2. The EStim 12 WP Lid with stainless steel electrodes (made as per EStim 12WP Lid MWI V1) was retrieved from the top shelf in the biomaterials area of the Main Lab.  
  
a. Inspect the wiring connections to the electrode to ensure no corrosion or
damage is present and all wiring is still connected as expected.  
b. Inspect the electrodes closely to ensure no damage or dissolution has
occurred to the metal.  
  

  3. The electrode lid was thoroughly sprayed down with 70% ethanol and brought into the BSC, where it was laid on its back underneath the portable UV lamp so that cell-contacting components of the lid were positioned upward, not touching the BSC bench.     13:10  

  4. The BSC screen was closed and the UV lamp was turned on by the internal powerpoint switch on the BSC control panel. The UV sterilisation setup was left to run for at least 1 hour (see image below).    time    13:10 - 14:10  

  5. The portable UV lamp was removed from the BSC at the end of the sterilisation period.




## Imaging

1\. Imaged both plates, taking whole well images of every well using the zaber
time 14:10  

For information on how to use the zaber, refer to:

ad19527eee9e42ed9db96faa911d6536

Tips for imaging the 12WP are to use 8x8 imaging sites in the HSC site
generator, remembering to change the spacing rule to field of view with 60 um
spacing. Remember to build the MM List in the HSC site generator and confirm
the number of images expected (usually >700) in the Mult-D Acq.




## Start Electrical Stimulation

###  

### Gelatin = Blue and Orange plate (Laminin is Yellow and Green)

###  

### 1\. For instructions on how to use the StimJim for electrical stimulation
of cells, see the StimJim Notion Page.

###  

### 2\. Electrode Submersion

  1. The seeded culture plate  Plate ID 9431, 9432  was removed from the incubator and placed in the BSC  15:05  

  2. The regular lid was removed from the BSC and the electrode lid was placed on the seeded culture dish.
  3. The plate was placed in the  sanyo ID #120  incubator without any electrical connections  15:10  



### 3\. Connecting the Wiring

The test hook can be opened by squeezing the spring loaded test hook handle.
Connect the correct test hook to its corresponding electrode pin.  
  
The channels are colour coded. Connect the two wires for each colour to its
corresponding column. By convention, we connect the black hook to the left pin
and the red hook to the right pin. This is to maintain experiment consistency.
It is best not to touch the metal electrode pins while doing this since they
are delicate. It is recommended to hold the plastic culture dish lid for
stability. The wiring should be connected as per the images below:

  



### 4\. Perform a Test Run

For detailed instructions on how to do this, refer to the StimJim Notion Page.  
  
This is to check and record the voltages the cells are actually seeing, using
feedback function within the StimJim.  
The test run is set for a finite amount of time. Anywhere between 10 and 100
seconds is recommended.

  1. Ran the stimulation pulse   16:40   
Stimulated with parameters:  
  
S0,0,0,500000,10000000; 4500,2000,6000; -4500,-2000,6000  
  
Changed the frequency from 2 to 20 Hz  
S0,0,0,50000,10000000; 4500,2000,6000; -4500,-2000,6000  
  
Paste the above sequence into the Serial Monitor.

  2. Paste the response from the StimJim in the Serial Monitor below. It should begin with 'Parameters for PulseTrain[0]'  
  
  
\----------------------------------  
Parameters for PulseTrain[0]  
  mode[ch0]: 0 (Voltage output)  
  mode[ch1]: 0 (Voltage output)  
  period:    50000 usec (0.050 sec, 20.000 Hz)  
  duration:  10000000 usec (10.000 sec)  
  
  stage    duration     output0   output1  
    0     6000 usec     4500mV     2000mV  
    1     6000 usec    -4500mV    -2000mV  
  
\----------------------------------  
  
  
  
  
  

  3. Executed with command T0. Paste the response displayed on the Serial Monitor below. It should begin with 'Started T train with parameters of PulseTrain 0'.  
  
Started T train with parameters of PulseTrain 0  
Train complete. Delivered 200 pulses.  
Current/Voltage by stage:  
           Ch0                Ch1    
Stage 0  2637mV,            1617mV,  
Stage 1 -2364mV,           -1486mV,  
  
  
  
  
  

### 5\. Begin Continuous Stimulation

For detailed instructions on how to do this, refer to the StimJim Notion Page.

  1. Ran the stimulation continuously    17:10    
Altered the code to eliminate duration limit (so no feedback) and ran the
above stimulation parameters continuously. Executed with command T0.  
Once more, paste the complete response displayed on the Serial Monitor (as
recorded in the Test Run) below:  
\----------------------------------  
Parameters for PulseTrain[0]  
  mode[ch0]: 0 (Voltage output)  
  mode[ch1]: 0 (Voltage output)  
  period:    50000 usec (0.050 sec, 20.000 Hz)  
  duration:  10000000 usec (10.000 sec)  
  
  stage    duration     output0   output1  
    0     6000 usec     4500mV     2000mV  
    1     6000 usec    -4500mV    -2000mV  
\----------------------------------  
  
  
  
Started T train with parameters of PulseTrain 0  
  
  
  
  




### Observations/Summary:

 100 % media changed on vessel(s)

  1. All vessels.

Electrical stimulation started on both plates

  

When starting the stimulation., it was noted that the plates were not being
stimulated by observing a square waveform on the oscilloscope. A multimeter
was used to locate the problem to a damaged connection, which was then
repaired. Afterwards, the oscilloscope showed curved waveforms, indicating the
connection to the plates had been reestablished and the stimulation was
reaching the cells.




Media/Reagents used:

NameDetailsVolume used (mL)  
E6 Diff MediaA8666  
 40 mL  
  
  
1\. Warmed up media: 12:30-13:00  
2\. Removed 100% supernatant and replaced with 1.5 mL of E6 diff media (did
the same for all wells in both plates, changing tips in between plates)  
3\. Returned to Incubator #118 @ 13:45
