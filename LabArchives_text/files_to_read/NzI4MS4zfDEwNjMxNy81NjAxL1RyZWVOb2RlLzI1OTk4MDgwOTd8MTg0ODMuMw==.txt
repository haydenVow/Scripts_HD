Total number of wells per plate = 12

Total number of plates = 2

Total number of wells = 24

Plate 1: Added 0.4 mL laminin to 7.6 mL sterile dPBS (8 mL total) -> 1:20
dilution, of which 0.5 mL was coated in 12 wells (6 mL used)

Plate 2: 0.5 mL of gelatin was added to 12 wells of the second plate (6 mL
total)




### Process:

1\. Gelatin coated     1     x    12-WP      vessel with sterile filtered 0.1%
gelatin solution and then incubated all coated flasks at 37˚C.

  1. Time when all vessels(s) placed into the incubator       15:00 (25/11) 

2\. Laminin coated     1     x    12-WP      vessel as per the protocol in
EPIC25611.

  1. Time when all vessels(s) placed into the incubator       12:00 (26/11)  




1\. Performed a cell count using the haemocytometer and recorded the cell
count data in the Google Doc spreadsheet: Cell Count Spreadsheet or cell count
widget below

  1. Total cell number was:      850000     

  2. Volume of cell suspension required for subculture was:      1.6 mL   
  3. Final seeding density per well: 35.4K cells / well




13\. Transferred      1.6     mL of cell suspension to the pre-warmed       24
or 36    mL growth media.

14\. Transferred cell suspension into the pre-gelatin / laminin coated       2
x 12-WP     vessel.

15\. Left at RT in the BSC for 30 min to allow cells to settle      14:10  -
14:30   (Laminin)     14:18  -  14:38   (Gelatin)

16\. Transferred vessel(s) to incubate at:

  * [X]  37ºC @ 14:38 (Contherm #118) , 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (avian cells)

Version Change Log

NameChange Details  
V1 (original)N/A  
V2Changed all sentences to past tense to better reflect a hand-written lab
book entry.  
Various formatting changes.  
Addition of more detail to step 2, removal of step 3. Replaced volume
requirements table with updated volumes @Sep 22, 2020  
Updated temperature selection for mammalian/aviary cells @Sep 23, 2020  
V3Included a section for 'vessel type' in passage ID table Replace
'flask/plate' with 'vessel' throughout lab book Include at step 1 to take
image of vessel on the microscope  
Mentioned that dPBS for washing should be warm - step 3(2) and 5.  
Added timepoint at step 4 for when vessel is removed from incubator  
Include at step 11 to aliquot cell resuspension into microcentrifuge tube  
Included at step 10 and 13 time point for when cell pellet is resuspended and
when resuspended cells is moved into growth media.  
Included p38i in table of regent used  
Combined two dPBS entries in 'Media/reagents' table Added 'cell density per
vessel'
