AIM/PURPOSE: What is the purpose of the experiment and what is the measurable
outcome you are looking for e.g. ''To assess cell adhesion of DOLLY12 MuSCs on
nanofibrous gelatin and zein scaffolds''  
  
Why? Including an aim gives your experimental design a purpose and prompts you
to ask yourself before starting the experiment whether your design does in
fact address the proposed aim.  

HYPOTHESIS: Include a specific and measurable hypothesis. Phrase positively
e.g. ''DOLLY12 cells will adhere and maintain adherence of over 70% confluence
to nanofibrous gelatin and zein scaffolds after 14 days in ACF media.''  
  
Why? Writing out the hypothesis will encourage you to ensure your experimental
design will allow you to support/disprove the hypothesis, and to ask yourself
questions such as: Is there sufficient replicates to ensure statistical
significance?
