RELATED TO MILESTONE:  Milestone 1

AIM/PURPOSE: To identify factors that can increase maturation from the current
baseline levels (non-reactor environment, standard E6 maturation media)

HYPOTHESIS: If we stimulate muscle cells with additional methods they will
produce more protein and show other signs of maturation.

RESULTS SUMMARY: We identified creatine supplementation and electrical
stimulation as potentially easy to implement candidate to enhance muscle
maturation in vitro in a home-built bioreactor.

CONCLUSIONS: Multiple maturation factors were identified, some of which are
relatively easy to implement and test.

NEXT STEPS: Implement at least 2 of the factors identified, starting with
creatine supplementation and assessing feasibility of electrical stimulation
by sourcing hardware and initiating proof of concept experiments in house.
