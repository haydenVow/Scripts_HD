Note: Please cut 3 small pieces of 1-2g off the large biopsy (ID:154) to use
for Proteomics, genomics and histology.




PROCESS FOR BIOPSIES TO BE STORED:

Proteomic and Genomic samples

\- NOTE 1: If using posiclick tubes (ie. with click lids) PLEASE punch a small
hole in the top of the lid, this will prevent the tube from exploding when it
is removed from the -80C freezer.

\- NOTE 2: If possible, please use certified DNase/RNase free tubes for the
genomic samples

  
Method: 1-2g muscle samples should be carefully placed inside a small 1.7ml
posiclick tube (or cryo-vial) and then immediately immersed in liquid
nitrogen. Samples should be allowed to freeze and equilibrate for at least 2
minutes (14:58 - 15:00) before transferring to the -80C freezer (15:01 pm)

Histology samples

\- NOTE 1: Before starting, remove the plunger from a 5-10ml syringe and trim
either side of the top circular piece (opposite end of the rubber plunger).
This should leave you with a rectangular strip of plastic 3-5mm in width and
1-2cm in length

  

  

\- NOTE 2: For this preparation you will need a small plastic urine jar with
~30-50ml of isopropanol and a container of liquid nitrogen (a small esky works
well).

Method:

  1. Make up 0.1% PFA in PBS in a 50mL urine pot and leave at 4 degrees. Placed in fridge 
  2. Trim off a small piece of biopsy, ideally this should be rectangular in shape with the long side running with the grain of the muscle (so, muscle fibres should run down the long side). The piece should be no more than 10mm X 5mm X 5mm (at most, it needs to be small enough to fit on the end of a syringe) 
  3. Place the piece of muscle into 0.1% PFA and put into the refrigerator for 60mins. 16:52 PM  

  4. Wash the muscle piece 3x5min in PBS  
 17:53 - 17:58 pm  
 17:58 - 18:03 pm  
  18:03 - 18:08 pm  
  

  5. Transfer liquid nitrogen from the transport dewar to a styrofoam esky to a depth of ~3cm
  6. Fill a urine container with 20-30mL of isopropanol.
  7. Punch a hole in the lid of all 1.5mL tubes required to store samples using a pair of sterile scissors.
  8. Place the isopropanol container into the liquid nitrogen (do not allow liquid nitrogen to spill and mix with isopropanol).
  9. Once the isopropanol begins to visually freeze (it should visually turn white) proceed with O.C.T mounting.
  10. Place a biopsy piece onto the face of the trimmed plunger and cover with O.C.T mounting medium.
  11. When 10% of isopropanol has frozen dip the biopsy piece into the isopropanol for 5 seconds.
  12. Use forceps to transfer the frozen sample in OCT to one of the 1.5mL tubes and place immediately into liquid nitrogen surrounding the urine container.
