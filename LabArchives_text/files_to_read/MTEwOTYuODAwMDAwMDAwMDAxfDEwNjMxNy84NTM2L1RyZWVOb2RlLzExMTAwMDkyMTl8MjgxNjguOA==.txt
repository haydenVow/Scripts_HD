Observations  
  
12597 DUCK EYE  
OptiPRO + 4mM Glutamax  
 Large number of unattached cells however attached ones appear healthy, 10%
confluent.  
  
12598, 12599, 12600 MUSCO Large number of unattached cells. Attached cells are
small, 5% confluent.  
  
12596 KHAKIO  
 Healthy, fibroblastic as well as cobbled. 20% confluent.  
  
12601 MUSCKDMEM/F12 + 10% KSR  
 Vast majority of the cells unattached.  


  
  
Process:

  1. Aliquotted   75mL  mL of  OPRIPRO Media and 15mL KSR media
  2. Placed in water bath   13:30
  3. Observed cultures under the microscope (see table for observations)
  4. Removed  50  % of media from vessel. 
  5. Replaced with  15 mL (per well/per vessel)
  6. Returned vessel to incubate at: 13: 59

  * [ x ]  37ÂºC, 5% CO2 , library lab incubator #77




### Observations/Summary:

50 % media changed on vessel(s)

Due to the high number of unnattached cells still present, cells were given a
50%, rather than 100% feed today.
