### Process:

1\. Took image of vessel with microscope on phase setting. Include link in
image section

2\. Gelatin coated     1     x      4CF and backup 1 x 2CF    vessel  with
sterile filtered 0.1% gelatin solution and then incubated all coated flasks at
37˚C.

  1. Time when all vessels(s) placed into the incubator       :   a/pm 

3\. Aliquotted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then
placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath for a minimum of 20 minutes
prior to use:

  1. TrypLE:     30    mL in 
  2.  dPBS (At 37 degrees for washing):      30   mL 
  3.  dPBS (at RT neutralising):     30    mL 
  4. Growth media (for pellet resuspension):     5   mL 
  5. Growth media (for seeding):    600      mL

Time that all aliquots were placed in the water bath the warm before use
12:15 pm - 600 mL GM, others, 12:40  pm

Note: if aliquots were placed in water bath at different time, record the time
stamp for each individual solution.




4\. Removed vessel(s) from the incubator     13:54  

5\. Washed the vessel(s) with dPBS (warmed).

6\. Added     10    mL tryple to each vessel/well and incubated at 37˚C.

  1. Start/Finish for TrypLE was     14:04 - 14:14      

7\. Neutralised with     10 mL    dPBS and combined cell suspension into    2
x 50 mL falcon  tube.

8\. Centrifuged at 650 x g for 5 min.

  1. Start/Finish time for centrifugation was     14:43 - 14:48    




9\. Aspirated the supernatant(s).

10\. Resuspended pellet(s) in    2-4     mL     Growth     media     15:10  

11\. Aliquoted     10 uL     of resuspended cells into a microcentrifuge tube
for cell count.

12\. Added 10 uL of Trypan blue to the microcentrifuge with the resuspended
cells (2x dilution).

13\. Used 10 uL of the above cell suspension to perform a cell count using the
haemocytometer and recorded counts in "Seed Calculator" widget (see below):




13\. Transferred      2.98      mL of cell suspension to the pre-warmed
600     mL Growth media:      16:25  

14\. Transferred cell suspension into the      4CF       pre-gelatin coated
vessel.

15\. Left at RT in the BSC for 30 min to allow cells to settle      16:34 -
16:54  

16\. Transferred vessel(s) to incubate at: 16:54

  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (avian cells)
