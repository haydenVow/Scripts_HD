Passaging PABPC1 clones, 5D, 5E, 5A, 6C  

1\. Aspirated and discarded the supernatant from wells on plate 11387  

2\. washed each well with 1 mL dPBS (a10920)  

3\. Aspirated and discarded the wash and added 1mL of Tryple (a11014)  

4\. incubated at 30 degrees for 8 minutes  

5\. neutalised with 1mL of dPBS and collected cell suspensions into 15mL
tubes, Removed 600uL and transferred to 1.5mL tubes for further DNA extraction
and PCR.  

6\. spun cells down in centrifuge at 500g for 5 mins

7\. removed and discarded supernatant  

8\. resuspended in 1 ml new culture media (m11220, D/F12 + 20% FBS + 1xP/S)
and transferred 250 uL into a new 6 well plate containing 3mL of pre-warmed
culture media.  

9\. Transferred plates to incubate at 30 degrees, 5% CO2 in incubator 82 main
lab (culture ID. 11649)  

Spun down 1.5mL tubes at 500g for 5 minutes, aspirated and discarded
supernatant, then added 25uL of Quick extract to each tube and performed a DNA
extraction using the BENTOLAB.

Prepared PCR master mix.

  2. Obtained 0.2 mL PCR tubes
  3. Added 25μl of respective primer MM to each sample tube as per the table above
  4. Added 3μl of wild type CHOMP07 DNA extract to each tube, added 2uL of MilliQ to each tube to make a total reaction volume of 30uL.
  5. Took samples to the PCR machine (BENTOLAB) and set the settings to (melting temp for primers used was 61 degress C).  

  6. Ran the cycle with a hold temperature of 14 degrees, left overnight.
