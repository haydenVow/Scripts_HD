46Seed the batchAseptically transfer the seed cells to a sterile bottle. Make
an aseptic connection between the bottle and the bioreactor mutliport. Pump
the seed cells into the bioreactor.Operating manual page(s) 81, 46Need extra
long tubing with sterile luer cap to be put into BSC to aspirate seed cells
and transfer to bioreactor or STT connector. Should we add pen strep at this
point instead of before sterility test to prevent hiding contamination?
