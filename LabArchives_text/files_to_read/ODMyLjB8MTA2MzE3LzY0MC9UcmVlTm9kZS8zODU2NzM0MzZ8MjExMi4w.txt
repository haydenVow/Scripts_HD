Reagent preparation:

1\. Aliquotted   12 mL   PBS for washing

2\. Centrifuged the secondary antibody stock using the benchtop
microcentrifuge for 10 seconds.

3\. Prepared Secondary Antibody mix:

   1µL   Secondary #1 AF555 IgG2b  (1:1000  ) +  999 µL Blocking Buffer (PBST
(0.1% Triton X + dPBS) + 3% BSA)  

Total volume required =    1000ul

If using AlexaFluor secondary antibodies then the max concentration should be
1:500 (typically used at 1:1000)

Vortexed antibody mix for 5 seconds and stored refrigerated away from light
until needed.

4\. Prepared DAPI (1:1000) mix:

 1498.5 uL   PBS +   1.5 uL  of DAPI

Vortexed DAPI mix and stored refrigerated away from light until needed.

Process:

1\. Removed plate from fridge (incubated in primary antibodies overnight).

2\. Washed 3 times for 5 min with PBS at RT.

10:57 - 11:02

11:03 - 11:08

11:09 - 11:14

3\. Incubated the cells with secondary antibody mixture in the dark at RT for
1 hour.  11:20 - 12:20

NOTE: from this step onwards protect from the light by wrapping plates in foil
and perform experiment in the dark.




Counter staining

1\.  Removed 2nd antibody solution.  12:26

2\.  Washed with DAPI (1:1000) in PBS for 5 min at RT in the dark.

12:27 - 12:32

3\.  Washed in PBS 3 x 5 min at RT in the dark. (No Triton)

12:33 - 12:38

12:39 - 12:44

4\.  Replaced dPBS.

12:45  

5\. Confirmed staining on microscope by imaging.
