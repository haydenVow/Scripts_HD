Procedure




Entered the manual haemocytometer counts into the widget above. However, when
calculating the seeding density of the E5000, the two Quad counts were used
instead (due to it being lower / a more conservative estimate).

Firstly, the two Quad counts were averaged (420k + 710k / 2 = 565k cells /
mL). Assuming that the E500 (volume = 200 mL) had a density of 565k cells /
mL, the seeding density of the E5000 was calculated by doing the following:  
(565k cells / mL x 200 mL) / 2200 mL* = ~51364 cells / mL  
  
*Note: The final volume of the E5000 was ~2200 mL, which was a result of adding the cell suspension from the E500 (~200 mL) with 2 L of fresh media.
