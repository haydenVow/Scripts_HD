Growth Media:

  * [ ] DMEM/F12 + 20% FBS + 1X P/S
  * [ ] E8 + goodies




### Process:

  

Note* due to Fibrolife flask containing almost 0 adherent cells, it was
decided to discard these and move forward with E8 + goodies.

  

1\. Took image of vessel with microscope on phase setting.

3\. Aliquotted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then
placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath for a minimum of 20 minutes
prior to use:

  1. TrypLE:    10     mL in     1    tubes
  2.  dPBS (for washing and neutralising):     20   mL in    1    tubes
  3. Growth media (for pellet resuspension):    1     mL of each media in    1   tube each  

  4. Growth media (for seeding):      12   mL of each media in    1     tube

Time that all aliquots were placed in the water bath the warm before use
10:33 am

Note: if aliquots were placed in water bath at different time, record the time
stamp for each individual solution.




4\. Removed vessel(s) from the incubator     10:43   am

5\. Washed the vessel(s) with dPBS (warmed).

6\. Added      5   mL tryple to each vessel/well and incubated at 37˚C.

  1. Start/Finish for TrypLE was    10:47 am 

7\. Neutralised with     5     dPBS and combined cell suspension into a
15mL    tube for each media type.

8\. Centrifuged at 650 x g for 5 min.

  1. Start/Finish time for centrifugation was    11: 02  am 




9\. Aspirated the supernatant(s).

10\. Resuspended pellet(s) in     1    mL      respective    media     :   am

11\. Aliquoted     10uL each    of resuspended cells into a microcentrifuge
tube for cell count.

12\. Performed a cell count using the haemocytometer and recorded the cell
count data in the Google Doc spreadsheet called 'Cell Count Spreadsheet' (see
link below):

SSIBtIylyrBQE5kRX5Z8NtI/edit#gid=0

  1.  Total cell number was:      E8 + goodies: 412,000  
Serum control ~2M  

  2. Volume of cell suspension required for subculture was:      E8 + goodies: all  
Serum control: 271uL  

  3. Cell density per vessel:       412,000 cells per `100mm plate     




13 E8 + Goodies . Transferred      all     µl of cell suspension to the pre-
warmed       10    mL Growth media:      11:30    am

13 Serum control . Transferred      271     µl of cell suspension to the pre-
warmed       10    mL Growth media:      11:30    am

14\. Transferred cell suspension into the pre-gelatin coated      100mm plates
vessel.

  

16\. Transferred vessel(s) to incubate at:

  * [ X ]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (avian cells)

Observations/Summary:

\- Fibrolife cells 99% detached from surface of flask

Successful passage of fibroblasts in E8 + goodies and serum control into 100mm
plates each




### Results:

  * Results were;
    * [ X ]  As Usual (this is a repetitive task)
    * [ ]  Unexpected because...
    * [ ]  Need to be further analysed
    * [ ]  Other (.......)
