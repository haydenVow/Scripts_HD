  1. Made up 500mL of DMEM/F12 + BSA (18.75 mg/ml) + 1X ITS + 1X P/S + LAA2P (150ug/ml)
  2. Aliquotted 120ml seperately and added 18g of Ficoll 70 to the 120mL aliquot in order to make a 2X of 75 mg/ml (highest concentration). Solution took approx 1 hour to dissolve at 37C.
  3. Aliquotted 96 ml of Ficoll 400 and added 9.6g of Ficoll 400 to the 96ml aliquot in order to make a 2X of the 50 mg/ml (highest concentration).
  4. Sterile filtered all three medias (both Ficolls and Basal Media) using filter units.
  5. Formulated each condition as above in 50mL falcon tubes.
  6. Split each 30mL condition into 3 x 10ml aliquots in 15mL falcon tubes (3 for each OT2 run - 2 plates ea).
  7. Loaded labware into Dana and Otis Opentrons in Main lab and calibrated.
  8. Ran OT2 protocol for first two plates 14:55pm (51 and 52)
  9. Ran OT2 protocol for second two plates 15:07pm (53 and 54)




Observations/Summary:

Originally Carrageenan was planned for this experiment to be assessed in
various concentrations against Ficoll 400. However, in reality CN was blocking
both syringe filters and filter units after multiple attempts. Hence, a
decision was made last minute to just assess both Ficolls (70 and 400) against
one another to determine the most optimal combination.
