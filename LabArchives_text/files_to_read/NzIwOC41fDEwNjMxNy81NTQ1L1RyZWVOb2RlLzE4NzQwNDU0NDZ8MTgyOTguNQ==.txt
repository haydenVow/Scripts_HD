Process:

  1. Please observe the 2x 75s under the microscope to check for any interesting/ abnormal findings. 
  2. Place the already aliquoted media into the water bath (30ºC, for reptilian cells)   17:50
  3. Removed  50 % of supernatant (6 mL) from each vessel. 
    * Note: please use separate serologicals when aspirating supernatant for each flask as they are different types of CHOMP cells
  4. Replaced with  6 mL per vessel of  growth medium. 
    * Note: please use separate serologicals when transfering the medium into each flask as they are different types of CHOMP cells)
  5. Returned vessel to incubate at:   18:05

  * [ ]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (avian cells)
  * [x]  30ºC, 5% CO2 (reptilian cells)

### Observations/Summary:

 50 % media changed on vessel(s)  
Observation under the microscope reveals Chomp07 to be detaching/ unravelling
from the surface of the T75 flask. This may be due to over confluence and
delayed passaging. They were last passaged on the 17th November. When observed
by eyesight alone, there were no visible signs of peeling. While the cells did
not appear to have detached from the surface of the flask after the 50% feed
we cannot rule out loss of cells due to this unravelling seen under the
microscope. Observation without the microscope did not observe any signs of
peeling. A modified approach to passaging (to prevent loss of cells) will be
needed to prevent loss of cells.  
  
Comparatively, the CHOMP09 cell line cultures have remained consistently
attached and confluent. Images have been attached below.
