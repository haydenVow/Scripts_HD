Batch Overview

Batch Weight

Yield from 2x T175 for each treatment:  
20% FBS + TGF + VitC: 0.260 g  
10% FBS + TGF + Vit C: 0.231 g  
10% FBS + TGF: 0.225 g  
10% FBS + VitC: 0.145 g  

Achievements

  * TGF-b1 treatment alone doesn't do much for production batches
  * Vit C only treatment might be worthwhile exploring for increased yield and easy trypling
  * 48hr treatment of TGF-b1 + Vit C may be worthwhile for maximum aggregation and potentially eliminating TrypLE step
  * longer trypLE time yields 13.35% increase in total cells yield but also meant a higher percentage of cell death

Observations from 24-hr treatment

20% FBS + TGF + VitC: most cells have formed aggregates, no cells adhered to
surface on 1xT175, and very little adhered to surface on the other 2 (looks
like they will clump and lift off)  
10% FBS + TGF + Vit C: a combination of aggregates and sheet, some cells have  
10% FBS + TGF: no aggregates. cells still adhered to surface  
10% FBS + VitC: no aggregates. Cells still adhered to surface (edited)  

For harvesting, the majority of cells for TGF+Vit C treated (10% or 20% FBS)
were present in the aggregates. Very little cells were collected from TrypLE
of the 20% FBS flasks, and there were some sheet like fragments present in the
TrypLE of the 10% FBS.

TrypLE-ing of Vit C treated flasks came off as a 'sheet'. TGF treated flasks
were harvested regularly without any spectacular difference to normal.

Weighed pellets appeared to be relatively the same between all treatments
except TGF only which was about 55-65% of the other cell pellets. 20% FBS +
TGF + VitC resulted in the heaviest pellet.




Observations from 48-hr treatment

20% FBS + TGF + VitC: almost all cells have formed aggregates, very little
adhered to surface  
10% FBS + TGF + Vit C: a combination of aggregates and sheet, but more cells
had come off and formed aggregates with pro-longed treatment (we circled an
area with cells still attached after 24hr treatment, and saw that a decent
portion ~75% of this area had come off)  
10% FBS + TGF: no aggregates. cells still adhered to surface  
10% FBS + VitC: no aggregates. Cells still adhered to surface (edited)  

Trypling of Vit C treated flask came off as a fluid sheet but did seem to
break apart the longer it was left in trypLE and was quite gloopy - like mucus
(in the falcon tube - also more easily broke apart with a pipette)

Pellet weights from a single T175 for each treatment weren't very accurate due
to the scale sensitivity and small yield.
