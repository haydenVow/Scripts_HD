  10. place samples in the fridge at 4°C until further use in isolation.  : pm

In BSC:

  1. Transfer the remaining 4 samples into the BSC and into 3 x falcon tubes containing 15 mL of Tissue Wash Media.   14:04 pm
  2. Pipette 10ml of Mincing Media (LDF basal media) into 3x 100 mm petri dishes
  3. Place each sample into its own media containing petri dish and mince samples into 0.1mm - 5mm sections.

Outgrowth (fin) protocol:

  1. Pipette 3ml of LDF media condition into 3 wells of 1 x 6-well plate (well A1 is uncoated, well A2 has gelatin coating and well A3 has matrigel coating)
  2. Collect Sample 2 (thin strands on fin) and transfer equal parts into each well of the Dish.
  3. Transfer to incubator at 26C, 5% CO2

Placed the dish into an empty incubator set to 26°C, 5% CO2  14:53 pm

  

Outgrowth (connective tissue) protocol:

  1. Pipette 10ml of digest media into 1x non coated plate
  2. Collect Sample 2 (connective tissue + muscle) and transfer into a Dish.
  3. Mince with 2 scalpels for 5 mins 14:18 - 14:23 pm
  4. Transfer minced tissue to a new 10cm culture dish, and supplement with 10mL additional LDF media
  5. Transfer dish to incubator at 26C, 5% CO2

Placed the dish into an empty incubator set to 26°C, 5% CO2  14:40 pm

Enzymatic digestion protocol  
  
Digest 1

  1. Transfer the minced tissue from the other 2x petri dishes to 2x 50ml falcon tube each containing 30 ml Digest Media (LDF basal media + Collagenase)
  2. Incubate for 2 hours, at 26°C with optional agitation in the water bath. 14:28 - 16:28 pm
  3. Centrifuge tubes at 500 x g for 1 min  16:41 - 16:45 pm 
  4. Carefully transfer supernatant from both digests to a new 50 mL tube
  5. Pass cell suspension through a 50 uM cell strainer 
  6. Centrifuge tube at 500 x g for 1 min.   17:17 - 17:18 pm   

  7. Wash the cell pellets with 25mL  Isolate Wash Media (LDF+ 1xantibiotic/antimycotic solution + NaCl + urea)

  8. Aspirate supernatant from pellet.
  9. Resuspend pellet in 1 mL Resuspension Media
  10. Take small aliquots of each cell suspension and observe under haemocytometer to gauge cell density.
