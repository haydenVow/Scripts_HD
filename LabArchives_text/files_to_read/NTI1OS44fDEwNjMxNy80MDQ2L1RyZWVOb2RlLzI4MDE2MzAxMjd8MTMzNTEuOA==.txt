### Process:

1\. Took image of vessel with microscope on phase setting.

2\. Aliquotted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then
placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath for a minimum of 20 minutes
prior to use:

  1. TrypLE:     9    mL in     1x 15 mL    tube
  2.  dPBS (for neutralising):     9    mL
  3.  dPBS (for washing):     9    mL
  4. Growth media (for pellet resuspension):     15    mL
  5. Growth media (for seeding):     3    mL 

Time that all aliquots were placed in the water bath the warm before use
15:34

Note: if aliquots were placed in water bath at different time, record the time
stamp for each individual solution.




4\. Removed vessel(s) from the incubator   15:45

5\. Washed the vessel(s) with dPBS (warmed).

6\. Added     3    mL tryple to each vessel/well and incubated at 37˚C.

  1. Start/Finish for TrypLE was   15:53  \-  16:10  

7\. Neutralised with     3 mL     dPBS and combined cell suspension into a
3x 15 mL     tubes.

8\. Centrifuged at 650 x g for 5 min.

  1. Start/Finish time for centrifugation was   16:20 - 16:25  




9\. Aspirated the supernatant(s).

10\. Resuspended pellet(s) in     1    mL     Growth     media   16:32

11\. Aliquoted     10 uL     of resuspended cells into a microcentrifuge tube
for cell count.

12\. Performed a cell count using the haemocytometer and recorded the cell
count data in the Google Doc spreadsheet: Cell Count Spreadsheet or cell count
widget below

  1. Total cell number was:    
8025: 404,000  
8026: 100,000  
8027: 520,000  

  2. Volume of cell suspension required for subculture was:  
8025: 433 uL  
8026: all  
8027: 337 uL  

  3. Cell density per vessel:     175,000 per T25 (7K/cm2)       




13\. Transferred      required volume     of cell suspension to the pre-warmed
5    mL Growth media:    16:45

14\. Transferred cell suspension into the      T25      vessel.

15\. Transferred vessel(s) to incubate at:

  * [x]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (avian cells)




Observations/Summary:

\- Low cell count for flask 8026
