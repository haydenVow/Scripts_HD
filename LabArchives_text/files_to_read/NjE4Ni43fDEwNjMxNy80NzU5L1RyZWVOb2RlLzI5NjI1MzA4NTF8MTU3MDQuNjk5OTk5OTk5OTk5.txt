RELATED TO MILESTONE:  PPP_Q4_KR1 Develop a QMS-compliant serum-free media
that supports 20+ doublings of our chosen species in suspension

AIM/PURPOSE: To determine the cheapest Hoechst 33342 stain product for
suspension culture cell counting

HYPOTHESIS: That Hoechst 33342 alternatives will be cheaper per sample than
the current Hoechst Readyflow reagent

RESULTS SUMMARY:

1\. At a final concentration of 5 ug/mL both Hoechst trihydrochloride
trihydrate as initial powdered stock or in solution produced comparable image
quality to Hoechst Readyflow when imaged under the DAPI filter.

2\. Readyflow produced precipitate/fluorescent particles causing false
positives in automated cell counting.

3\. Both solid and solution Hoechst trihydrochloride trihydrate products,
particularly when used to stain cells without dPBS dilution, produced
comparable cell counts in suspension cultures grown in media that did not
contain phenol red (CD CHO).  
4\. Cell counts obtained from staining with Hoechst trihydrochloride
trihydrate (solid) were similar to counts obtained from manual trypan blue
exclusion.

5 . Hoechst trihydrochloride trihydrate as powdered stock is the most cost
effective option, with the lowest cost/unit and cost/sample.

Hoechst trihydrochloride trihydrate (solid) staining. Counts were obtained
from the seeding of F_DOLLY12 cells  for the commencement of EPIC28384.

  

CONCLUSIONS:  
The hypothesis was confirmed, with both Hoechst alternatives dramatically
cheaper than Hoechst Readyflow on a cost per sample basis.  
1\. Reconstituted Hoechst trihydrochloride trihydrate powder (SKU: H1399) is
7000 times cheaper than Readyflow making it the most economic choice for use
in high throughput suspension culture monitoring

2\. Both Hoechst trihdyrochloride trihydrate products produced cell counts
that were comparable to Readyflow

3\. Hoechst products when added directly to cells at a final concentration of
5 ug/mL as solutions in MilliQ and without dPBS dilution gave the highest cell
counts

NEXT STEPS:  
1\. Edit suspension culture (https://au-
mynotebook.labarchives.com/share/Templates/NzM0LjV8MTE3MTM1LzU2NS9UcmVlTm9kZS8yNzU4NjI3ODQyfDE4NjQuNQ==
)and Hoechst staining for clone picking ( https://au-
mynotebook.labarchives.com/share/Templates/NzU2LjZ8MTE3MTM1LzU4Mi9UcmVlTm9kZS8zMjAzNjY1NjQxfDE5MjAuNg==
) lab book templates to include staining protocol using Hoechst
trihydrochloride trihydrate (solid)  
2\. Compare counts to Trypan Blue exclusion method to confirm and further
improve staining method accuracy.  
3\. Test the staining method on another cell type, preferably a proliferative
suspension culture, against the Trypan Blue exclusion method.
