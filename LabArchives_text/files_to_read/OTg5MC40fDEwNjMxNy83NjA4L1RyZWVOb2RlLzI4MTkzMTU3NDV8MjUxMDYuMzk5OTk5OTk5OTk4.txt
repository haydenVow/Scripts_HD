Process:

1\. Aliquotted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then
placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath for a minimum of 20 minutes
prior to use, 9:55pm

  1.  Growth media (for seeding):    90mL 

2\. Collected the cryovial from Liquid Nitrogen storage & place in foam
floater in water bath for approx. 3 min until vial just de-frosted

Location where cryovial was collected from:

 Homer

Tower/Bucket #4

Box/Cane #6

Vial location: D9

Vial ID(s): 14167




3\. Ethanol sprayed & transferred the vial(s) to the BSC.

4\. Added  500µL of Growth Media (to generate a total volume of 1mL in the
cryovial) to the cryovial, resuspended the cell suspension gently to reduce
osmotic shock.

5\. Collected the entire 1mL of cell suspension & transfer into the pre-warmed
tube of Growth Media (prepared in Step 2).




6\. Using a 10mL serological pipette, resuspended & distributed the cells
evenly in the  90 mL of pre-warmed Growth Media (prepared in Step 2).

7\. Seeded cells into (non-gelatin coated) flasks/wells at approximately 7k
cells per cm2.

  1. e.g. 1 million fibroblasts can be seeded into 1 x T175

8\. Transferred  30 mL to each  T175  flask/well.

9\. Transferred flask/plate(s) to incubate at:

  * [x ]  37ºC, 5% CO2




SOPs used:

  * SOP_Thawing Cells Into Adherent Culture V_02
