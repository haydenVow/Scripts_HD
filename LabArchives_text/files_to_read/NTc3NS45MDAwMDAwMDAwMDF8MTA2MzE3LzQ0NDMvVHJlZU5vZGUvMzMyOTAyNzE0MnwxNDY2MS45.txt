Process:

1\. Aliquotted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then
placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath for a minimum of 20 minutes
prior to use:

  1. TrypLE:    30   mL in  1  50 mL tube
  2. dPBS (for neutralising and washing)     30 mL in     2   50 mL tubes
  3. Growth media:     90  mL in    2   50 mL  tubes
  4. Times that all aliquots were placed in the water bath to warm before use    15: 08

Note: if aliquots were placed in water bath at different times, record the
time stamp for each individual solution.




2\. Washed the flask(s) with dPBS.

3\. Added     10  mL tryple to each vessel/well and incubated at 37˚C for
15   min. 15:43-15:58  

Note: Fibroblasts typically require 15-18 minutes of incubation with tryple,
slightly longer than MuSCs.

4\. Neutralised with    10   dPBS (warmed) and combined cell suspension into a
15    tube.

5\. Centrifuged at 650 x g for 5 min

  1. Start/Finish time for centrifugation was  14  :19    \-  14:24   




6\. Aspirated the supernatant(s)

7\. Resuspended pellet(s) in       3 mL growthmedia for each tube (topped up
to 10mL total)  

8\. Transfer 10 uL of cell suspension to a 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube and
performed a cell count using the haemocytometer and recorded the cell count
data in widget or the Google Doc spreadsheet called 'Cell Count Spreadsheet'
(see link below):

9\. Total cell number was:       11,760,000  

10\. Seeded 4651 cells per cm2 of the flasks/plates. Note that fibroblasts
prefer to be subcultured closely together.

11\. Volume of cell suspension required for subculture was:     10mL  

12\. Transfer    10mL of cell suspension to the pre-warmed  600 mL Growth
Media.

13\. Transfer cell suspension into 1x 4CF

14\. Transfer flask/plate(s) to incubate at   17:  20  

  * [X]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
