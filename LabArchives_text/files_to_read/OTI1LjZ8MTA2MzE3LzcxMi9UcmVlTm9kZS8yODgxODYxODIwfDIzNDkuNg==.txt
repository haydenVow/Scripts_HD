Notes  
  
  
  1. Checked any "wetted" materials (materials that come into contact with the culture or additives and are therefore required to maintain sterility) for damage or residues that may introduce contamination (examples include seals and tubing).
  2. Checked any potentially dangerous equipment (e.g. gas regulators, gas lines, pressure release valves) for abnormalities that may lead to an accident.  
  




Checked hardware power, network connection and software access
