Note

Final culture terminated today




Process:  

  1. Collected E125s from shaker, wiped with ethanol-sprayed Rediwipe, and brought into BSC 
  2. Using a 25 mL serological pipette, gently pipette-mixed culture for a few minutes to break up cell clumps
  3. Transfer suspension into 50 mL tubes.
  4. Centrifuged 50 mL tubes at 400 x g for 5 mins 
  5. Aspirated  75% (15 mL) of supernatant, taking extra care to not disrupt or aspirate pellet.
  6. Resuspended each pellet in the remaining 5mL of media, and took 2x 10ul samples from each culture for hemocytometer counts 
  7. Performed  hemocytometer counts (see below for counts).
  8. Topped up each 50 mL centrifuge tube with 15 mL of fresh pre-warmed media and resuspended cell pellet. 
  9. Pipette-mixed cultures, and transfer all cultures to E250 flask
  10. Took a 100ul sample and plated into a single well of a 96 well plate, along with 100ul of OptiPro media +4mM glutamax. 
  11. Discarded culture
