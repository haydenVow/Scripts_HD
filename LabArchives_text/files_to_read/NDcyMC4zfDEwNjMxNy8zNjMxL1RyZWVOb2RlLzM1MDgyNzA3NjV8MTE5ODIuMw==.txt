Process:

  

1\. Gelatin coat 2 x 12WP   10:53am  

2\. Retrieved   2x 24 mL  of  Growth Media aliquots in   1x 50mL  tube(s) from
main lab media fridge 74 h  

3\. Added  2x 12 uL p38i for 1/2000 dilution

4\. Aliquots placed in water bath  

5\. Removed  100  % of gelatin from from the vessel/s.

6\. Seed each well of the  12WP  culture dish with 60k - 80k cells.

Refer to lab book for harvest:  https://au-

For  2x 12WP  culture dishes, seed  1.5 to 1.9M cells  into the pre-warmed 48
mL growth media. - seeded at 1M per plate, therefore 2M total cells used.

7\. Seed each well with  2mL (per well/per vessel) of  growth   media.
