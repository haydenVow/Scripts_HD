In late Dec Alex commented that the proteomic data was showing vastly
differing emPAI scores across every sample and the challenges we have in
normalising these for comparison across samples. The samples that show the
greatest difference in max score values are as follows:

Highest: P015 = ~100mill; P06 = ~10mill

Lowest: P002 = ~7k; P001 = ~30k

It was noted that the processing pipeline had evolved with each batch of
samples, so it was decided to re-process the samples from jobs #1747 (P001-
#1791 (P0 and #1799




The best two runs for the following samples were re-searched using the smae
method as for samples P013-P023. i.e. file conversion from .raw to .mgf using
PD 2.5:  

P001 Approx 0.5g of frozen sheep cells (Dolly12 Myoblast) from the -80 freezer

P002 Approx 0.5g of frozen mouse cells (C2C12 differentiated) from the -80
freezer

P003 Approx 0.5g of frozen sheep (lamb) backstrap tissue from the -80 freezer

P004 V2 mince (store-bought sample, flash-frozen, mostly soy protein, but also
contains vegetable oils (tocopherol).

P005 Store-bought sample, 'sheep biopsy 20/2/20', flash frozen

  

P006 - Sheep myoblast

  

P007 - Sheep fibroblast grown on roller bottles

  

P008 - Sheep fibroblast grown on planar culture

  

P009 - Water Buffalo myoblast

  

P010 - Cow myoblast

  

P011 - Mouse myoblast

P012 - Crocodile fibroblast grown on planar culture

  

P013 - Crocodile fibroblast grown on roller bottles

  

P014 - Store bought Impossible patty for alternative protein comparison (Soy)

  

P015 - Store bought Crocodile tail fillet tissue
