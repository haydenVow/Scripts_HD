Interaction effects \- what combination of media, wetness, seeding density and
scaffold results in the highest scaffold confluence on day 1.  

  
Data entered into table - Condition and Confluence only, zein and gelatin in
same data set, serum controls included

Key findings:

  
  




Interaction effects on Gelatin only - i.e. how does wetness, seeding density
and media type combined influence gelatin scaffold confluence.

Output for with and without serum ctrls included.  
  
Data in table = Gelatin scaffolds only, condition and confluence.

Key findings:

\- Seeding density, scaffold wetness and seeding media type had no significant
difference on scaffold confluence, with no significant difference observed
between conditions.

  




Interaction effects on Zein only - i.e. how does wetness, seeding density and
media type combined influence zein scaffold confluence.

Output for with and without serum ctrls included.  
  
Data in table = Zein scaffolds only, condition and confluence.

Key findings:

\- Seeding density, scaffold wetness and seeding media type had no significant
difference on scaffold confluence, with no significant difference observed
between conditions.

  




Main effects - does seeding density, wetness and media type have an overall
effect (positive or negative) on scaffold confluence regardless of scaffold
material (i.e. when trying a new scaffold is there a blanket condition that is
typically better overall for achieving high confluence).

  
Data in table: Confluence, Scaffold, Wetness, Seeding density, serum controls  
  
Key findings:  
Wetness, Seeding density, and Media had no significant overall effect on
confluence when both scaffold types were compared.  
  
However, when only Gelatin only scaffolds were analyzed for main effects, a
seeding density of 1M cells/scaffold was found to significantly favor scaffold
confluence, relative to 0.7 and 2M cells/scaffold.
