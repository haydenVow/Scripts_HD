Process:

1\. Aliquotted  20 + 10 + 10 mL  mL of  Growth Media into  3    tube(s).

Added 5uL LAA2P + 25uL TGF to 10mL of Growth Media as per table above.

Added 5uL LAA2P to 10mL of Growth Media as per table above.

Placed in water bath  16:45 -17:05

2\. Removed   100 % of supernatant from vessel.

3\. Replaced with  10 mL (per well/per vessel) of  respective media (see table
above).

4\. Returned vessel to incubate at:   12:55 pm

  * [ X ]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (aviary cells)

  

  * Incubator (# 77 ), Lab [Library]




### Observations/Summary:

Note* cells were 100% confluent upon checking

 100 % media changed on vessel(s)
