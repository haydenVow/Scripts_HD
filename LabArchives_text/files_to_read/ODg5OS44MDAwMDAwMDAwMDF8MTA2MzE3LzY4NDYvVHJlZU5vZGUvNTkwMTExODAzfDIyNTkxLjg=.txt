### Process:

1\. Disposed of cultures 10601 and 10604 due to lack of cells wen viewed under
the microscope

2\. Took image of vessel with microscope on phase setting.  

3\. Aliquotted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then
placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath for a minimum of 20 minutes
prior to use:

  1. TrypLE:  1x 20 mL  

  2.  dPBS 1x40  

Time that all aliquots were placed in the water bath the warm before use
17:06

Note: if aliquots were placed in water bath at different time, record the time
stamp for each individual solution.




PASSAGE - 2XT175

4\. Removed vessel(s) from the incubator    18:11

5\. Washed the vessel(s) with dPBS (warmed).

6\. Added      10   mL tryple to each vessel/well and incubated at 37ËšC.

  1. Start for TrypLE was  18:15-18:25

7\. Neutralised with     10mL     dPBS and transferred each cell suspension
into a    50mL     tube.

8\. Centrifuged at 650 x g for 5 min.

  1. Start/Finish time for centrifugation was   18:29-18:34   




BUFFY PASSAGE - 2xT175

9\. Aspirated the supernatant(s), leaving 5 mL of dPBS  

10\. Resuspended pellet(s) in remaining dPBS

11\. Aliquoted      10uL    of resuspended cells into a microcentrifuge tube
for cell count.

12\. Performed a cell count using the haemocytometer and recorded the cell
count data in the Google Doc spreadsheet: Cell Count Spreadsheet or cell count
widget below

  1. Total cell number was:   10602 (DMEM With CO2): 11,460,000      10603 (L-15): 4,240,000
