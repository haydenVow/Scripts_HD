Prepare materials for thaw and seed:

1\. Aliquotted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then
placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath for a minimum of 20 minutes
prior to use:

  *  Growth media serum control :    12.5 mL (0.5 mL for topping up freeze media in vials with GM) 
  * Growth media (for seeding):    12   mL of the following media's: condition 1, 2, 3 (3 mL of which will be for pellet resuspension) in   3x 15 mL    tubes
  * Time that aliquots were placed in the water bath to warm before use:   13:10      

  




## Thaw and seed vial:

3\. Collected the cryovial from Liquid Nitrogen storage & place in foam
floater in water bath for 5 min   14:34 - 14:39  

Location where cryovial was collected from:

Vial details:  2  x  1mL  cryovials at   1M  cells each for a total of  2M
cells

Brew

Tower/Bucket # 2

Box/Cane # 2

Vial location: F5  

Vial ID(s): 2330-Culture-6303-Vial-51of115

Vial location: F6  
  
2331-Culture-6303-Vial-52of115  

`4. Ethanol sprayed & transferred the vial(s) to the BSC.`

`5.  Added  500µL of Growth Media (to generate a total volume of 1mL in the
cryovial) to the cryovial, resuspended the cell suspension gently to reduce
osmotic shock. `

`6. Transferred 120 uL of cell suspension` from each vial `into each of the
pre-warmed tubes of media``  
`

 ~~` ~~7. Using a 10mL serological pipette, resuspended & distributed 500K
cells each evenly in the 12mL of pre-warmed aliquot of serum control.~~`~~

`8. Transfered  12mL to each T75  flask/well.  
`

`9. Transfered flask/plate(s) to incubate at    14:50  in the main lab Sanyo
incubator #116: `

  * [X]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (aviary cells)

  

Making labels

Note - You will need to increase the passage number by one. (i.e. if your
thawed vial ID has a passage number of 3, when you make a culture ID for you
vessel you will need change the passage number to 4 on Airtable.)

  




Observations/Summary:

New flasks were thawed as flasks 7844 and 7845 previously seeded showed signs
of cell death
