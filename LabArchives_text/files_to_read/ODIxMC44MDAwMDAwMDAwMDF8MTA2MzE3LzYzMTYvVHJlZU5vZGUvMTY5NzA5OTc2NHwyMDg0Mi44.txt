NameDetailsVolume used (mL)  
Growth/Proliferation Media: DMEM/F12 + 20% FBS + 1X P/SA9127  
25 mL (15 mL required for T175, 6 mL for T75, 4 mL excess)  
  
  




Process:

  1. Observed + imaged 1x T175 & 1xT75 under the microscope to check for any interesting / abnormal findings (3 images on 4x and 10x each should be suffice). 
  2. Placed aliquoted media into the water bath for 10 mins (30ºC, for reptilian cells)  11:19
  3. Removed  50 % of supernatant (15 mL) from the T175.
  4. Replaced with  15mL of  growth medium.
  5. Removed  50 % of supernatant (6 mL) from the T75.
  6. Replaced with  6 mL of  growth medium.
  7. Returned vessel to incubate at: 11:38
