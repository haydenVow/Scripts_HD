Procedure

                                                                         

  1. Coat flasks with 0.1% gelatin solution per flask and place in the 37C Incubator for 1 hour. Refer to V-SOP-002 for gelatin preparation if required.  
`Number of flasks coated`: 4xT175  
Time stamp: 11:30am  

  2. Extract required growth media into aliquots as listed in the table above and add p38i to each aliquot. Mix thoroughly and place into a heated 37C water bath for 20 minutes.   
Time in water bath: 13:45pm  
[ X ] p38i added.

  3. Select the vial/s for thawing. Note the location of the vial in Liquid Nitrogen(LN) Dewer.  
Path: Stockyard v1 > Frozen Cultures > Select Vial/s (Use highest number
first, ie 62of62)

  4. Obtain selected number of cryovial/s from LN Dewar and thaw in the 37C water bath on a foam floater for a maximum of 5 minutes.  
*NOTE: Ensure to wear PPE and work swiftly whilst performing this this task. Ensure to wear cryogloves and face shield when handling the liquid nitrogen dewar. Ask a Vowzer for help if required.  
`Time stamp`: 14:27-14:32  

  5. Spray and wipe the cryovial and growth media thoroughly with 70% EtOH and transfer into the Biohazard Safety Cabinet (BSC).
  6. Slowly add 500uL of growth media into the/each vial. This will produce a total of 1mL cell suspension per vial.
  7. Resuspend the cells gently and transfer all contents from the vial to the bottom of a 50mL falcon tube. *NOTE: Dispensing suspension of cells on the sides of the tube will risk loss of cells in Step 11.
  8. Add an additional 500uL of growth media to each vial to collect remaining cells and add into the centrifuge tube. A total of 1.5mL will be in each vial.
  9. Resuspend cells thoroughly and immediately extract 50uL into a microcentrifuge tube.
  10. Perform cell count (Refer to VSOP-007) from collected sample and use the Cell Counting Spreadsheet  to enter data.

11\. Extract all contents from the centrifuge tube and dispense into the
prepared growth media. Wash the tube with 5-10 mL of the same growth media to
extract remaining cells attached to the tube.  
12\. Transfer the gelatin coated flasks from the 37C incubator into the BSC.  
13\. Discard the gelatin and add required volume of growth media to each
flask, ensuring the entire surface is coated and leave inside the BSC for 20 -
40 minutes. Use the 'Bec Drop' to lay down the flasks.

  1. Turn on the water bath and set to 37'C.
  2. Aliquot  required growth media and p38i into a sterile container/s and place into the water bath.  
    [x] p38i added. 
  3. Place in the water bath and heat for at least 20 minutes.
  4. Observe the cell flasks for confluence under the microscope using 4 x magnification and take images as required. Note: The confluence of cells must be <50% to perform cell feeding in P1-P3 and <80% in P4 prior to the cell differentiation stage. 
  5. Transfer flasks to the BSC and remove required volume of media from each flask (according to the Table above).
  6. Replace the same volume into each flask with the prepared growth media.
  7. Return the flasks to the incubator.
