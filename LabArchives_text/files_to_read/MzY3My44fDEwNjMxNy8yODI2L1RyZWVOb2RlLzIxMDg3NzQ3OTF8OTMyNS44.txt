Prepare materials for thaw and seed:

1\. Aliquotted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then
placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath for a minimum of 20 minutes
prior to use:

  *  Growth media (for seeding 96 wp):   2 mL 
  * Growth media (for seeding T175 flask: 30 ml  

  * Time that aliquot was placed in the water bath to warm before use:  15 :32   

  




## Thaw and seed vial:

3\. Collected the cryovial from Liquid Nitrogen storage & place in foam
floater in water bath for 5 min 15 :47 - 15:52  

Location where cryovial was collected from:

Vial details: 1 at  1M  cells

Brew

Tower/Bucket #2  

Box/Cane # 2

Vial location: B4  

Vial ID(s):2292

`4. Ethanol sprayed & transferred the vial(s) to the BSC.`

`5.  Added  500 µL of Growth Media (to generate a total volume of 1mL in the
cryovial) to the cryovial, resuspended the cell suspension gently to reduce
osmotic shock. Took aside 10uL and performed a cell count. `

`6. Collected the entire 1mL of cell suspension from the vial & transfer into
29 mL of warm media.`

`Performed a cell count`

`Total cell number: 1 164 000  
`

``volume needed for 600 cells: 15 uL

``

`7. Prepared a cell suspension of 600 cells in 2 mL. Used this to seed 28
wells of a 384 well plate with 50 uL/well. This should result in approx 15
cells per well. `

`8. The remaining cell suspension was used to seed 1x T175 flask `

`9. Transferred flask/plate(s) to incubate at: 16:26`

  * [X]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (aviary cells)

  

Making labels

Note - You will need to increase the passage number by one. (i.e. if your
thawed vial ID has a passage number of 3, when you make a culture ID for you
vessel you will need change the passage number to 4 on Airtable.)

Summary:

Revived 1 vial of F_FOLLY12 WCB into ax T175 flask and some wells of a 384 wp
in DMEM/F12 + 10% FBS + 1x P/S
