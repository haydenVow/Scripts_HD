Process:

  1. Attempted to sterile filter Carrageenan media by passing the 110mL solution through a 150mL filter unit - however the solution would not pass through. This was re-attempted with a syringe filter and syringe however yielded the same result
  2. Ficoll 70 media passed through filter unit and was sterile filtered. It was decided that this DSD would be modified to omit Carrageenan as it was not able to be sterilised and only assess concentrations of Ficoll PM 70 from 0 to 300 mg/ml.
  3. This new design will assess the following concentrations below, spread out across two 48 well plates (each column refers to a particular concentration - 6 replicates). Another two 48 well plates was done too to increase replicate number.

Observations/Summary:

Carrageenan did not pass through filter unit and hence could not be
sterilised. The DSD was modified so that only Ficoll 70 could be assessed but
now with with a higher sampling rate across the concentration gradient from 0
- 300 mg/ml with more replicates (at least 10).

The concentration range shown in the table above spans across each column in 2
x 48 well plates.
