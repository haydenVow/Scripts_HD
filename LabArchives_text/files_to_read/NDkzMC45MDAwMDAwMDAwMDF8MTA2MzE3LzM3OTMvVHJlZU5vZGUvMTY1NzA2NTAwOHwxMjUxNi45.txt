Aim/Purpose


To adapt clones to suspension

To test different media formulations for suspension adaptation of muscle stem
cell (MuSC) and fibroblast clones


Hypothesis


Both clones will be able to adapt to suspension in at least 1 of the
conditions below.


Technical Gap


This is the first time an immortalised clonal population will be adapted to
suspension, rather than a heterogenous population of cells. This addresses the
technical gaps in several ways:

  * being able to scale up more easily by having suspension cultures, rather than adherent
  * using a clonal cell line so that the production/manufacturing process is consistent and reproducible
  * finding a media formulation that supports suspension adaptation of cells


Method/Procedure


D0: Seed cells to suspension culture in 50mL bioreactor tubes.

Thaw each of the following clones into 4x 50mL tubes, each at 1M cells/tube.

DOLLY12_11E7 (MuSC clone from last quarter)

F_DOLLY12_4C4 (best performing fibroblast clone)

  
4 conditions for each clone, 3 replicates per condition  
5ml of each of the basal medias below supplemented with 1x P/S, 1:100 anti-
clumping agent + 0.1% pluronic + 100ng/mL each FGF, IGF1, PDGF.

1\. RPMI + 5% FBS

2\. RPMI + 20% KSR

3\. CD-CHO + 5% FBS

4\. CD-CHO + 20% KSR

D4, D8, D12, D16, D20, D24, D28

Perform 100% media changes every 4 days by centrifuging the cell suspensions
at 300xg for 5 minutes, discarding the supernatant and resuspending cells in
their respective growth medias.

D14, D16, D18, D20, D22, D24, D26, D28, D30  
After cells have been in suspension for 2 weeks, begin sampling every 2 days
for live/dead staining and counting. Cell counts are performed by centrifuging
suspensions at 300xg for 5 min and then resuspending in 500ul. 20ul samples
are then taken for counting using a Hoechst/Propidium iodine staining
protocol. On non-feed days, medium can be retained and returned to cells after
the count. Ideally, this process will be completed using the newly developed
OT2 protocol.
