This quick and small experiment was done ad hoc, hence it did not go through a
formal experimental plan review process with Ella. The plan was reviewed by
James H before execution. In future, it will be made sure that all experiments
even ad hoc ones should be reviewed formally.


Aim:


To determine whether recombinant albumin is able to facilitate adherence
similar to bovine serum derived albumin in Nuvonis fibroblasts.


Rationale:


Based on the previous experiments, albumin has been identified as a key factor
in promoting suspension Nuvonis cell adherence. This study aims to determine
if Human Recombinant Albumin achieves the same effect and if so, at what
concentration.
