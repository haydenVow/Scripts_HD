Growth Media:

  * [x]  DMEM/F12 + 20% FBS + 1X P/S




### Process:  

For Passage: Heat the following to 30C in the water bath

  1. TrypLE:     10  mL in      1   tubes
  2.  dPBS (for neutralising):   10   mL
  3.  dPBS (for washing):     10 mL
  4. DMEM + 20% FBS + 1 x PS for pellet resuspension + Seeding):    250   mL

Time that all aliquots were placed in the water bath the warmed to 30C before
use  15:10  

Note: if aliquots were placed in water bath at different time, record the time
stamp for each individual solution.




Passage  

  1.  Removed vessel(s) from the incubator   15:40   

  2. Washed the vessel(s) with dPBS (warmed).
  3. Added 10ml  tryple to vessel/well and incubated at 30ËšC.
  4. Start/Finish for TrypLE was     15:45-15:55  

  5. Neutralised each with with   dPBS (equal to volume of tryple) and transferred to  1x 50 mL    tube.
  6. Centrifuged at 650 x g for 5 min.
  7. Start/Finish time for centrifugation was   16:00-16:05  

  8. Aspirated the supernatant(s).
  9. Resuspended pellet(s) in   5 mL   growth   media
  10.  Aliquoted   20uL  of resuspended cells into a microcentrifuge tube for cell count.
  11. Performed a cell count using the haemocytometer and recorded the cell count data in the Google Doc spreadsheet called 'Cell Count Spreadsheet' (see link below):

SSIBtIylyrBQE5kRX5Z8NtI/edit#gid=0  

    1. Total cell count was : 9,900,000
    2. Re-suspended cells in 210mL pre-warmed growth media
    3. Re-seeded cells into 7x T75 flasks (30mL per flask), giving a seeding density of 8,080/cm
    4.  Incubate at 30C and 5% CO2. 16:30
