RELATED TO MILESTONE:  KR2 - Increase late stage maturation markers by 10x
compared to non-stimulated baseline

AIM/PURPOSE:

1\. to investigate the suitability of Alginate hydrogels as a cell
encapsulation matrix for mechanical stimulation

2\.  to identify the minimum cell density in alginate that results in
differentiation/maturation

HYPOTHESIS:

By increasing the cell seeding density inside alginate gels, we can create
sufficient cell-cell contact to enable differentiation and enable the use of
alginate as a matrix

RESULTS SUMMARY:

Cell viability was maintained inside Alginate gels, but no adhesion and
consequently, no differentiation was observed. Bradford results were partially
promising but, since differences between cell-laden and cell-free samples were
detected for2% Gels, but due to variability in sample size (gel pieces) no
quantitative comparison was possible.

  

CONCLUSIONS:

We found that high density encapsulation alone does not enable cells to adhere
and differentiate in matrices (such as alginate) that lack natural (ECM)
binding sites. Although cells survived inside alginate, they were not able
contract the gel matrix regardless of gel stiffness (1% vs 2%). Despite the
alginate matrix being optically clearer compared to previously studied gels
(collagen and fibrin), IF staining and imaging were not significantly easier
and alternative methods of maturation analysis need to be assessed.

NEXT STEPS:

  * include ECM proteins as a minor component to the alginate matrix
  * move to a sample format that allows for direct comparison between conditions without having to slice and weigh samples or normalize to cell counts in order to analyze degree of maturation, e.g. meatballs (3 mm gelbead with relatively consistent cell density)
