Cell expansion


04/01/2022

Expanding cells from liquid nitrogen stock tube at ~106 cells/mL to 2 x T75
flasks:

  1. Dolly 12 Sheep Fibroblasts (vial 2318 P8) thawed out from liquid nitrogen (5 minutes in 37°C water bath).
  2. Cells added to 24 mL DMEM/F12 media (giving total of 25 mL cells + media).

04/02/2022
Cell harvest practice day:

Protocol recommends 30-50ml Trypsin /g Cytodex
1 flask contains approx 0.087g cytodex
Therefore 2.6 - 4.3ml Trypsin is recommended. 
Trial 3ml Trypsin per flask. May need to increase if cells remain on beads after harvest or if small volume is too difficult to handle.

Protocol recommends 20-30ml Media /g cytodex to neutralise trypsin and collect
Therefore 1.7-2.6ml Media is recommended.
Trial 2ml media per flask.

Collect the total 5ml of cell suspension with Taipan. Wash back through Taipan with media or PBS to collect all cells.
Wash through Taipan with PBS before moving to next flask.

Proposed method:
1. Allow microcarriers to settle in E125 flask - 5 min
2. Remove media
3. Wash with 5ml PBS-EDTA for 5 min
4. Remove PBS
5. Add 3ml Trypsin, incubate at 37'C for 15 min
6. Add 2ml Media
7. Collect with Taipan while swirling. Wash 2x with PBS to collect all cells
8. Wash out Taipan with 50ml PBS into flask before moving to next flask
9. Spin and count cell suspension
10. Re-plate cells in T75 to assess quality

Notes:

Not practical to work with such low volumes in E125 flask - either lose too many microcarriers or don't wash thoroughly enough. 

Transfer culture to 50ml tube, allow it to settle. Perform steps in 50ml tube. Instead of using curved Taipan we used the tube with mesh at the end (same principle as Taipan but suitable for a 50ml tube)

Collect flask F - 5 million cells in on 25/01/22
Count - 505/4 * 2 * 10^4 = 2.525*10^6
Beads appear totally empty after harvest.
Cell counts on microcarriers over 10 days noted a decrease in cell numbers between D2 and D10

Collect flask B - 5 million cells in on 25/01/22
Count - 493/4 * 2 * 10^4 = 2.465*10^6
Beads empty.

Notes: 

Promising that flask F and B had very similar cell count after harvest - may indicate that technique was consistent between replicates. 

Based on cell counts over culture time a yield of 2.5 million seems reasonable. 

Method seems effective, as no cells were present on beads after harvest, however culture method seems to have flaw as cell numbers decrease drastically after 4 days in culture even after media changes were increased. Could shear forces of E flask be to blame? Move culture to stationary vessel.

Cells and beads are lost to media changes and decanting. Could a cell strainer be more effective than the straight Taipan for culture/harvesting in a 50ml tube? Leave out cell strainers for Ruth.

General tasks completed today:
1. Prepare and filter 1L PBS
2. Aliquot Trypsin-EDTA 0.25% into 10ml and 50ml aliquots - freeze
3. Count cells on cytodex-1 microcarriers, record in spreadsheet
3. Change media on E125 (25/01, 5 million cells) and (02/02, 2.5 and 5 million cells) - added 50% phenol-containing media
4. Change media on T75 (02/02) - 50% phenol-containing media
5. Practice harvesting with curved Taipan (2 E125 flasks, from 19/01 - 1.25 and 2.5 million cells)
6. Practice harvesting with straight Taipan (2 E125 flasks, from 25/01 - both 5 million cells, flasks B and F)
7. Replate 500,000 harvested cells from flasks B and F in T75s
8. Move 2ml of culture medium from E125 (02/02, 2.5 "a" and 5 "a") into 6-well plate and 5ml into 50ml tube (lids loose). Top up to 4ml and 15ml media, respectively.


06/02/2022

50% media feed of T75 flasks:

  2. Cells imaged and returned to 37°C incubator.

100% media change of E125 flasks:

  1. Transfer culture to 50ml tube, allow beads to settle for 5 mins
  2. Remove media, top up media and return to E125.

  




07/02/2022

Cells seeded on microcarriers and plated in 6 well plates (and left under
static rather than shaking conditions) were imaged. Very minimal attachment to
microcarriers observed as >99% of cells have adhered to the plate. This is
likely due to the fact that the microcarriers did not cover a large enough
surface area of the plate, leaving much of the treated plate surface exposed
and optimal for adherence.

Cells seeded on microcarriers and grown in vent cap 50 mL tubes (and left
under static rather than shaking conditions) were also imaged. There appear to
be ~15 cells per microcarrier in the vessels seeded with 5 million cells per
flask and some microcarriers have upwards of 25 cells. Growing cells under
these conditions may present a promising way forward.

Cells harvested on 04/02/2022 by Meg and plated (at 500,000 per flask) to
confirm viability were checked. They look morphologically normal and are
growing well, although grow appears to be at a slightly slower rate than cells
that have simply been passaged between T75 flasks. This indicates that our
harvesting method is not causing substantial damage to the cells.




09/02/2022

50% media feed of T75 flasks:

  1. 50% media change performed for all 26 flasks. I.e. 6 mL DMEM/F12 media removed and replaced with 6 mL fresh DMEM/F12 media.
  2. Cells imaged and returned to 37°C incubator.

50% media change of E125 flasks:

  1. Transfer culture to 50ml tube, allow beads to settle for 5 mins
  2. Remove media, top up media and return to E125.

Imaging cells:

Cells seeded on microcarriers and grown in vent cap 50 mL tubes (and left
under static rather than shaking conditions) were imaged. The culture has
crashed since yesterday and most microcarriers are now empty, with a maximum
of 3-4 cells per microcarrier. This may be a result of the cells being seeded
at too high a density (5 million cells per flask) and the microcarriers being
too densely packed in the bottom of the 50 mL tube. However, the media was
still orange-red, indicating that the pH of the culture was still optimal.

General tasks completed today:

  1. Prepare and filter 500 mL DMEM/F12 (10% FBS; 1% Pen-Strep)
  2. Practice harvesting with curved Taipan (2 E125 flasks)
  3. Practice harvesting with straight Taipan (2 E125 flasks)
  4. Plate out cells harvested via Taipan to ensure viability.

  




10/02/2022

Harvesting cells from E flasks using Taipan:

  1. Pour cells into 50 mL falcon, allow microcarriers to settle
  2. Remove media
  3. Wash microcarriers with PBS
  4. Release cells with Trypsin-EDTA; incubate at 37°C for ~10 minutes
  5. Separate cells from microcarriers with straight (silicon tube) Taipan immediately after/while neutralising Trypsin with PBS. This is to minimise the chance of cells migrating back onto the beads
  6. Wash microcarriers with PBS at least twice.
  7. Spin down cells, resuspend in media, count. ~3 million cells harvested per 5 million cells seeded = substantial cell loss.
  8. Image microcarriers. Microcarriers were all empty.

3 million harvested were plated across 6 T75 flasks at 500,000 cells per
flask.

Given that there was significant reduction in cell number but the
microcarriers were all empty, it is likely that cells are being lost during
feeds and each time they are moved between vessels. For this reason, we will
attempt media changes with the Taipan and harvesting will a cell strainer.
This will allow the microcarriers to remain in the E flask right until they
are separated from the microcarriers. Ensuring that the microcarriers never
leave the vessel to which they were originally added removes the risk of
losing microcarriers that get stuck to the sides of tubes and strippettes.




11/02/2022

50% media feed of T75 flasks:

  1. 50% media change performed for all 26 flasks. I.e. 6 mL DMEM/F12 media removed and replaced with 6 mL fresh DMEM/F12 media.
  2. Cells imaged and returned to 37°C incubator.

Harvesting cells from E flasks using cell seive:

  1. Pour cells into 50 mL falcon, allow microcarriers to settle
  2. Remove media
  3. Wash microcarriers with PBS
  4. Release cells with Trypsin-EDTA; incubate at 37°C for ~10 minutes
  5. Separate cells from microcarriers by pouring through cell strainer. Do this while neutralising Trypsin with PBS. This is to minimise the chance of cells migrating back onto the beads. Do not pour microcarriers from more than one E125 flask through a single stainer otherwise it will get clogged. Even a single E125 per strainer is probably too many beads for one strainer to handle.
  6. Wash microcarriers with PBS by pouring at least 50 mL of PBS through the beads on the strainer.
  7. Spin down cells, resuspend in media, count. ~4 million cells harvested per 5 million cells seeded = substantial cell loss.
  8. Image microcarriers. Microcarriers were all empty, HOWEVER, substantial numbers of unattached cells were visible between microcarriers within the microcarrier slurry left behind on the strainer. Evidently, the PBS washes were insufficient to remove all the cells from between the beads. Next time, we will attempt harvesting by inserting the strainer into the neck of the E125 flask so as to give a bigger area (i.e. the entire volume of the E flask rather than the volume of the strainer) in which to wash the microcarriers. This should, in theory, reduce the chances of cells getting trapped between beads and allow us to recover a greater number of cells.

Prepare microcarriers for seeding tomorrow: Weigh out 0.35 g of microcarriers
(enough for 4 x E125) and soak overnight in PBS.




12/02/2022

Seeding cells in E flasks for harvest via cell strainer: 2 million cells per
flask were seeded into 2 x E125 flasks containing 20 mL DMEM/F12 and 0.0875 g
microcarriers (suspended in 5 mL DMEM/F12).

Checking viability of cells harvested from microcarriers: Cells harvested from
microcarriers and plated on T75 flasks are growing well and appear
morphologically normal, suggesting that our harvesting method does not damage
the cells.

  




14/02/2022

50% media feed of T75 flasks:

  1. 50% media change performed for all 26 flasks. I.e. 6 mL DMEM/F12 media removed and replaced with 6 mL fresh DMEM/F12 media.
  2. Cells imaged and returned to 37°C incubator.

Count cells on microcarriers seeded at 2 million cells per flask: ~6-7 cells
per microcarrier.

50% media change of E125 flasks (USE TAIPAN):

  1. Tilt E flasks on a 45° angle using a 50 mL tube rack.
  2. Remove ~12 mL media with the straight Taipan device*
  3. Top up with 12  mL media and return to incubator.

*Keep supernatant removed in step 2, spin down and count cells (~500,000 cells), plate out in T75. These cells may explain a substantial proportion of our losses between seeding and harvesting from the microcarriers.




16/02/2022

50% media feed of T75 flasks:

  1. 50% media change performed for all flasks. I.e. 6 mL DMEM/F12 media removed and replaced with 6 mL fresh DMEM/F12 media.
  2. Cells imaged and returned to 37°C incubator.

Count cells on carriers in E125 (seeded 12/02/22 at 2 million cells/flask):
Approximately 6-7 cells per microcarrier.

Check on cells plated from E125 flask supernatant: Fewer than 1% of cells
plated out from E125 flask supernatant (following 50% media change on
14/02/2022) have adhered to T75 flask and changed morphology to grow
pseudopods. May cells remain in suspension and almost all of those that have
adhered are still round. These cells are likely in a state of senescence
caused by the fact that they were probably never able to attach to
microcarriers after seeding.

To improve cellular attachment to microcarriers, an incubation period of at
least 6 hours (with 2 mins intermittent stirring every 30 mins) should
trialed.


18/02/2022

1. Count cells on carriers in E125 - seeded 12/02/22 by Ruth at 2 million cells/flask. Approx 8 cells per carrier. 
2. 100% media change of E125s. Used Taipan for one - did not like how many beads stuck to the outside despite washing. Collected a further 50ml PBS wash and spun down to return to E125. Changed other flask by transferring to 50ml tube, removing most media, returning to flask with multiple washes. This method is much simpler and loses fewer beads.
3. Plate supernatant on T75s. Allow cells to adhere for 90 minutes then change media to assess free cells in E125 culture.
3. Continue culture of E125 to Monday. The cell density on beads is very variable, between 1 and 28 cells per bead was observed. Looking to maximise cell harvest off 0.0835g Cytodex 1 (the mass of beads in a single E125) to determine viability of upscaling to 20kg/month. 
4. 100% media change T75 flasks (no-one available to change Sunday, 100% will last until Mon/Tues)
21/02/2022

Cell attachment from E125 flask media change - Media collected by 50ml tube and stripette method had no cells. Media collected by Taipan had some beads and cells. Indicates that the cells originated from the beads clinging to the Taipan, and very few cells (if any) are free in the media at this stage of culture (post-seeding media change).

Cell growth in T75 after harvest from E125 - Cell growth seems fine, but some cell morphology appears different than cells exclusively grown in T75 culture - The morphology is unusually rectangular with visible stress fibers and no filipodia, indicating very strong attachment and limited migration. Normal morphology is spindle shaped.

Count cells on Cytodex-1 in E125 - Approx 6.3 cells per carrier. Dip since Friday.

Harvest cells from 2x E125 (12/02) - transfer to 50ml tubes, harvest with Taipan (Ron's wand) and count. Check the beads for full detachment. 
- Poor cell harvest - cells on beads, cells in bead suspension. Tiny cell pellet. Pellet A: 112,000 Pellet B: 82,000
- Trypsin step was at RT, should have been 37C. 
- Wash step was less than previous - would more washes increase yield?
- Collect in Trypsin, then wash with media? 
- Plated the cytodex beads after harvest to look for stray cells. Allow to adhere O/N. Tomorrow:
- 
1. Collect cytodex beads in media, harvest again and count.
2. Harvest cells adhered to T75.
3. Combine total cells, plus approx 112,000 cells to approximate total yield of E125.

Cell expansion:

  2. 0839 100% media change on cells thawed yesterday.
  3. 0910 cells harvested from surface of T75 to give 72 500 cells total.
  4. 0939 Fresh media made up.
  5. 0953 cells harvested from beads revealed 64 060 cells total.
  6. 0957 Most microcarriers were empty, however some still had 2-3 cells. The total cell harvest including yesterday and today comes to 248 560. This is nearly ten-fold lower than the cell count we seeded at. 
  7. 1004 UV on waterbath off. Old T75s with microcarriers harvested cells discarded.


24/02

Vials frozen at P7, therefore P+1 = P8. Don't want to use cells above P9-10. What happens when we want to expand on microcarriers? Cells will slow down. We need earlier passage cells. 
We could try a seed train to mitigate cell death at D6 - Split the carriers into new E flasks, hopefully we can get "full" microcarriers. This could allow us to avoid frequent passaging and keeps cells on the beads.

T75 flasks (Dolly 2321 P+1) 50% change

Thaw Dolly, seed at 300,000 cells/flask (into 3 T75s)

**Experiments to do -
**
Why are cells dying on cytodex-1 after 6 days? 
1. Media component lacking?
* Test - Plate at high density (2-5mill cells, like E125) in T75 with same media volume as E125 (25ml). 50% change every 2 days.
* Preliminary thought is - of course they will die, there is no surface for them and they will eventually detach. This is not a good control. Cytodex has plenty of space for attachment. 
* Test - increase media volume in E125 flask. Seed same cell density, compare 25ml culture to 50ml or 75ml. 

1. Shear forces disrupting cells
* Test - reduce or stop spin. First allow to adhere using intermittent shaking, continue intermittent shaking for culture.
Attached paper found similar cell death after 5 days of culture in spinner flasks 

Could more frequent passaging be the answer on microcarriers? In terms of optimal growth cycles it is not ideal - high turnover of carriers and lots of labour. But if the doubling rate is significantly improved it may be worth it. Can we re-use the carriers?

Test - Seed cells, grow in suspension (cannot simultaneously have reduced spinning and normal spinning with single shaker), harvest and re-seed every 4 days. Re-seed onto used vs new microcarriers.

Are the cell counts on beads reflective of expected cell numbers?

3. Make 1L PBS, filter.
4. Write report draft
27/02/22

1. 50% media change 2318 P8
2. 100% media change 2321 P8
28/02/22

1. Harvest 2321 P8 
2. Cell count - 488/8 * 10 * 10^4 = 6.1x10^6 cells/mL
3. 164uL per 1mill cells
4. Cells seeded at 1 or 2 million cells /0.087g Cytodex-1 in 25 or 50mL media. Shaker protocol: 100rpm, 2 mins ON : 28 mins OFF for 6h, then ON.
5. Brodie - count cells on beads at 6h timepoint (D0), look for non-adhered cells in media (adherence efficiency). Very few cells found in media, ranging from 0-3 per 10 uL.
6. Brodie - 50% media change on remaining 3 T75 flasks. Done.


To-do (Meg unavailable from Tuesday)-

Post-meeting with James Ryall and James Henstock (01/03/2022) UPDATED PLAN

Wednesday:

1\. Soak Cytodex-1 DONE 1145

2\. Cell count on beads DONE 1345

3\. Harvest cells DONE 1600

4\. Count and re-seed - new vs re-used (thorough wash steps to clean debris)
DONE 1740

5\. 6h adherence, count at 6h timepoint or following day to compare adherence
efficiency

  

Notes:

1mil 25mL: 2,4,7,3,2,5,5,3,1,6,1,9,5

Very few cells in media

2mil 25mL: 10,14,8,5,6,3,6,4,5,19,6,17,7,5,5,9

No cells in media

1mil 50mL: 3,2,2,4,2,2,5,1,3,1,0,6,5,3,3,6,2,4,7,7,4

A few ~5 cells in media

2mil 50mL: 3,6,6,8,4,8,5,5,5,6,6,8,8,2,11,11,6

Several cells in media



Trypsinization successful, microcarriers empty, can see quite a lot of cells
in the surrounding fluid however.



1mil 25mL: 28,37,30,27=30.5x10000=305000 cells/mL

2mil 25mL: 75,55,56,68=63.5x10000=635000 cells/mL

1mil 50mL: 17,25,14,18=18.5x10000=185000 cells/mL

2mil 50mL: 57,60,42,53=53x10000=530000 cells/mL

Total cells: 1655000

Cell count should be MUCH higher, this suggests massive cell loss during
harvest.

Looking at the PBS fluid containing the empty microcarriers in a hemocytometer
or glass slide reveals very few cells. Where are all the cells?

  

Two flasks of 827500 cells each made up, one with recycled beads, the other
with fresh beads. Cycling on/off every 6 hours for the first 6 hours. Will do
an attachment count in the morning.




3/3/22

16 hours post seeding:

Old: 2,1,1,2,3,4,3,3,2,1,1,1,0,1,2,0,0,2,4,1

Average: 1.7 cells/microcarrier

New: 1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,2,1,1,0,0

Average: 0.44 cells/microcarrier

Cell morphology was quite round in both conditions, not showing deep
attachment.

The difference in cell attachment is most likely due to a higher number of
cells in the old sample from residual cells that were not collected during
harvest.
