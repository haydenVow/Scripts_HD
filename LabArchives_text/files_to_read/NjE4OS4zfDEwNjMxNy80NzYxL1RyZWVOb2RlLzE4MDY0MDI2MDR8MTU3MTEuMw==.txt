Aim/Purpose


To determine the cheapest Hoechst 33342 stain product for suspension culture
cell counting


Technical Gap
Hypothesis


That Hoechst 33342 alternatives will be cheaper per sample than the current
Hoechst Readyflow reagent

A range of concentrations were chosen starting from the upper working range of
Hoechst stains with 50% serial dilutions. In the final rows (D and H), volumes
of stock solution of Hoechst trihydrochloride reconstituted in
MilliQ/trihydrochloride trihydrate/Readyflow will be added directly to cells
to determine whether dilution in PBS may cause precipitation as seen in
previous imaging runs. Staining and imaging quality will also be compared in
suspension cells grown in the presence (D/F) or absence (CD CHO) of phenol red
in their respective growth media.
