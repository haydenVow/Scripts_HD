Figure 1: Comparison between labelled and unlabelled DOLLY12 fibroblast nuclei
in sparse population in 384 well plate using a machine learning model trained
using fibroblasts cells in suspension culture. (a) DAPI image of unlabelled
fibroblasts stained with Hoechst in a well of a 384 well plate. (b) Phase
contrast image of labelled fibroblasts using a suspension trained machine
learning model in same well of a 384 well plate.  Cells imaged under DAPI
fluorescence channel, with 5x objective using the Zaber.
