## Feed performed by: Shaleen Sharma  




Note: Upon inspection under main lab Primo, it was found that cells were at
50% confluence and required further proliferation for a succesful maturation
assay. Hence it was decided to feed with growth media instead of switching to
E6 as planned. Media also looked somewhat colourless and hence instead of
100uL, each well was fed with 150uL.




Growth Media:

  * [X]  DMEM/F12 + 20% FBS + 1X P/S + P38i (1:2000)

Total media required: 24mL

Process:

1\. Aliquotted   25mL  mL of Growth Media into  1 x 70mL Sample Container
tube(s). Placed in water bath   11:04 a/pm

2\. Removed  100  % of supernatant from vessel.

3\. Replaced with  150 uL (per well/per vessel) of Growth Media    media.

4\. Returned vessel to incubate at:

  * [X]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (aviary cells)

  

  * Incubator (Thermo), Lab [Main/Library/Production]
