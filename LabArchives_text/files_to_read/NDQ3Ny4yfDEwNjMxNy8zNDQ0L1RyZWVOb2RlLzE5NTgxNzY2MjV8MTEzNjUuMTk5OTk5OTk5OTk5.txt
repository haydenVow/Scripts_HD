dish.

## Imaging

Imaged the plate, taking whole well images of every well using the zaber

Tips for imaging the 12WP are to use 8x8 imaging sites in the HSC site
generator, remembering to change the spacing rule to field of view with 60 um
spacing. Remember to build the MM List in the HSC site generator and confirm
the number of images expected (usually >700) in the Mult-D Acq.




Process:

Fixing for both plates ( ~ 20 - 30 min):

  1. Aliquoted  2 x 50 mL of PBS into  2 x 50 mL falcon tubes and  13 mL  4% PFA into   1x 15 mL  falcon tube. 
  2. Placed in the water bath and warmed for a minimum of 10 mins.   13:00 - 13:30  
  3. Removed media from each well and wash with warmed PBS twice. 
  4.  Added   1mL warmed PFA for 15 min:  13:45 - 14:00
  5. Removed PFA (and add in PFA waste container) and wash wells twice with   2 mL warmed PBS. 
  6. Wrapped plate in parafilm and placed in the   biomaterials   fridge for later staining.   time  




## Cleaning the Electrodes

When finished with the electrode lid, it will need to be cleaned and stored
away for later use.

1\. Inspect the wiring connections to the electrode to ensure no corrosion or
damage is present and all wiring is still connected as expected.  
2\. Inspect the electrodes closely to ensure no damage or dissolution has
occurred to the metal.  
3\. Spray down the used electrode lid with ethanol.  
4\. Fill the wells of a clean 12WP base with ethanol and place the electrode
plate in this base so the electrodes are immersed in ethanol.

A spare 'wash plate' is kept in the 'Electrodes' box.

5\. Place the 12WP assembly inside the ultrasonic bath so that the water of
the bath is at the line where the 12WP lid meets the base.  
6\. Set the ultrasonic bath temperature to room temperature and the time of
sonication for 15 minutes.  
7\. Reinspect the electrodes. If any media or other organic residue is still
present on the electrodes, repeat step 6.  
8\. Store the electrode lid by placing it onto a clean 12WP base. Ensure the
lid is dry before storage. Optional: Place the lid in the drying oven upside
down at 50C for 15 minutes to increase drying time.  Alternatively, to reuse
the lid immediately, proceed to the UV sterilisation process.
