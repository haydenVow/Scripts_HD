AIM/PURPOSE: To characterise Nuvonis suspension cell line growth curve over
multiple passages, and determine if viability changes over time

HYPOTHESIS: Nuvonis an immortalised and suspension-adapted cell line. It is
therefore hypothesised that the growth curve and doubling time of these cells
should stay consistent across consecutive passages

RESULTS SUMMARY:

CONCLUSIONS:
