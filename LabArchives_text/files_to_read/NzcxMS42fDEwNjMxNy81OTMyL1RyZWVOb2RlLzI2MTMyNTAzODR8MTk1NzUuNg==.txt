Prepare materials for thaw and seed:

1\. Aliquotted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then
placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath for a minimum of 20 minutes
prior to use:

  *  Growth media (for seeding):    20 mL 
  * Time that aliquot was placed in the water bath to warm before use:   16:20   

  




## Thaw and seed vial:

3\. Collected the cryovial from Liquid Nitrogen storage & place in foam
floater in water bath for 5 min  16:35 - 16:40

Location where cryovial was collected from:

Vial details:  2   x    cryovials at   10 million  cells each for a total of
20 million  cells

Vial location:

Vial ID(s): 3770 & 3771  

`4. Ethanol sprayed & transferred the vial(s) to the BSC.`

`5.  Added  500 µL of Growth Media (to generate a total volume of 1mL in the
cryovial) to the cryovial, resuspended the cell suspension gently to reduce
osmotic shock. `

`6. Collected the entire 1.5 mL of cell suspension & transfer into the pre-
warmed tube of Growth Media. `

`7. Using a 25 mL serological pipette, resuspended & distributed the cells
evenly in the  15 mL of pre-warmed Growth Media (prepared in Step 2). `

`8. Washed each vial with 1 mL of growth medium`

`9. Transfered flask/plate(s) to incubate at: `

  * [X]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (aviary cells)

  

Making labels

Note - You will need to increase the passage number by one. (i.e. if your
thawed vial ID has a passage number of 3, when you make a culture ID for you
vessel you will need change the passage number to 4 on Airtable.)
