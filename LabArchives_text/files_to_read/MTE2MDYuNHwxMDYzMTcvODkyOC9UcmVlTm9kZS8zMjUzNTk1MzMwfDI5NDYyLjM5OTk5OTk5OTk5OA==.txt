Process
  
  
  1. Performed a cell count and determine the total number of live cells present in the culture intended for cryopreservation.

    1. Took 2 x 1 mL samples per flask for count using 5 mL serelogical pipettes 

  2. Calculate the number of vials that are required to be frozen.

    1. Banking all cells @ 7.5M cells/mL in 1 mL of freeze medium (we only have 5 x 2mL cryovials in stock) ~~15M cells per vial in 2 mL of freeze medium (7.5M cells/mL)  ~~
      1. Total # cells = 1,285,254,000 cells
      2. Total # vials = 172 x 1 mL cryovials
  3. Determine the volume of cell suspension from the culture required for centrifugation.

    * 1,285,254,000 cells = 1.453L cell suspension  
  

  4. Fill the required number of Mr Frosty freezing container (18 vials per container) with the necessary volume of isopropanol.

  5. Prepare room temperature cell resuspension media (CRM) and cell freezing medium (CFM). Each vial is required to be filled with 50% CRM and 50% CFM, i.e., for 10 vials 5 mL of CRM and 5 mL of CFM is required. See below:

    * CRM: Complete 3:1 RPMI1640:CHO-in-1 Nuvonis suspension growth medium.
      * Total volume to prepare = 86 mL + 73.1 mL (needed to make up CFM) \+ 8mL excess  = 167
    * CFM: CRM with 15% DMSO.
      * Total CRM required: 73.1 mL
      * Total DMSO required: 12.9 mL
      * Total volume to prepare = 86 mL
  6. Transfer total cell suspension from the culture vessels into an appropriate vessel for centrifugation (i.e. 250 mL falcon tube).

  7. Centrifuge the cells at 310 x g for 10 minutes at 22°C in a swing out rotor.

  8. Aspirate the supernatant.

  9. Re-suspend the cell pellet in the total volume of CRM prepared earlier (15M cells/mL)

  10. Dilute the cell suspension by adding the total volume of CFM in the same vessel (7.5M cells/mL)

  11. Homogenise the cells suspension by gently pipetting.

  12. Aliquot the total volume of cell suspension into cryovials (2 mL per vial).

  13. Transfer the cryovials into the Mr Frosty freezing container.

  14. Place freezing container at -80°C for 16-24 hours.

  15. The day after freezing, transfer the vials from the freezing containers to ≤-150°C (liquid nitrogen dewars) for long term storage.
