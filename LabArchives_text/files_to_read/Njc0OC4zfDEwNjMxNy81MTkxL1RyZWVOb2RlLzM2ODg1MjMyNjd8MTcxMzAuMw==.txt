Process:

Fixing ( ~ 20 - 30 min)

  1.  Removed media from each well and wash with PBS   17:10 - 17:17 pm
  2.  Added  100 µL PFA for 15 min:  17:17 - 17:32 pm 
  3. Removed PFA (and add in PFA waste container) and wash wells with   200 µL PBS.
  4.  17:33 - 17:40 pm &  17:40 - 17:48 pm 
  5. Parafilmed and kept in the fridge for further analyses.  17:50 pm




Observations/Summary:

### All cells appeared 100% confluent and ready for differentiation. DOLLY12
MCB and DOLLY12 WCB cells appeared to be almost identical in morphology and
confluence, with even seeding. C2C12 cells appeared a lot more crowded despite
seeding at 750 cells per well (opposed to the primary cells seeded at 2000
cells per well).

Day 0 plates scanned on Phase (250 ns exposure) on the Zaber before fixing.
