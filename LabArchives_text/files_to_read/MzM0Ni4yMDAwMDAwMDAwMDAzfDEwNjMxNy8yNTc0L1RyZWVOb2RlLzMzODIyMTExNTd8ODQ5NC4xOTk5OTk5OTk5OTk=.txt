plate.  

  1. The Konjac samples were transferred directly into the wells of the 96 wp. 
  2. The beancurd sticks were extremely hard and could not be broken up using sterile scissors, and so were covered with DMEM and placed in the incubator for 10 minutes to soften before being plated. 
  3. After soaking in media, the beancurd knots were cut up using scissors and tweezers on a 100 mm plate
  4.  The beancurd samples were transferred into the 96 wp. 
  5. Samples were stored away in the incubator until needed
