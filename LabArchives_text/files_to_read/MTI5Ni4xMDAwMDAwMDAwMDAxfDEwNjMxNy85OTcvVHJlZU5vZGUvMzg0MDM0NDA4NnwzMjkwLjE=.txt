The media that is required for each condition is written on the flask to make
to easier to add the appropriate media to each flask. Also please make sure to
use a separate serological for each flask as they are separate conditions.

Process:

1\. Place pre-aliquotted  5 mL  mL of each Growth Media condition into the
water bath to be warmed (Tubes are in a blue tube rack in the library lab
fridge #104). Placed in water bath 10:25am

2\. Removed  100  % of supernatant from vessel.

3\. Replaced with  5 mL (per vessel) of  Growthmedia.

  1. 6684-DOLLY12-Sheep P9-1of5 (INTO Serum-containing media)
  2. 6685-DOLLY12-Sheep P9-2of5 (INTO DMEM/F12 + 1X P/S)
  3. 6686-DOLLY12-Sheep P9-3of5 (INTO E8)
  4. 6688-DOLLY12-Sheep P9-4of5 (INTO E8 + 5ng/mL PDGF + 7mM IGF-LR3 + 1:800 Protease inhibitor cocktail + 1:100 concentrated lipids)- labelled as "E8 goodies" on the corresponding flask. 
  5. 6689-DOLLY12-Sheep P9-5of5 (INTO E810C)

*Note: Please use a separate serological pipette when changing the media for each flask. 

4\. Returned vessel to incubate at [10:51 am]:

  * [x]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (aviary cells)

  

  * Incubator (# 77), Lab [Library]
