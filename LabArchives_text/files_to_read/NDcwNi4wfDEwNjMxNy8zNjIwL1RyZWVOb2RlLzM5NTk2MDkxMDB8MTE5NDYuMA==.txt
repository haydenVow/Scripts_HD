Process:

  1. Aliquoted growth media as indicated in the growth media section:
    * Placed in water bath  13:51  

  2. Prepared stain buffer in 15 mL tube by combining the following (1 drop of each stain solution per 1 mL of dPBS):
    * __ mL of dPBS 
    * __ drops of NucBlue Live Cell Stain ReadyProbes Hoechst 33342
    * __ drops of NucGreen Dead 488 Cell Stain ReadyProbes Sytox Green
      * Vortexted mix for ~5 seconds, then stored in dark until ready to use. 

  
E-125 flasks

  1. Collected E125s from shaker, wiped with ethanol-sprayed Rediwipe, and brought into BSC
  2. Using a 25 mL serelogical pipette, gently pipette-mixed culture for 1 minute to break up cell clumps
  3. Pipette suspension though 70 um cell strainer into 3 x 50 mL tubes. Kept E125 vessels in BSC, as culture will be returned to this vessel after feed. 
  4. Centrifuged 50 mL tubes at 300 x g for 5 min.   14:13 - 14:17 
  5. Aspirated  15 % ( 15 mL) of supernatant, taking extra care to not disrupt or aspirate pellet 
  6. Added  15 mL of fresh, warmed growth media to each 50 mL tube
  7. Gently pipette-mixed cultures using serelogical, before moving cell suspension back to E125s
  8. Took 100 uL samples from each culture and stored in separate microtubes until ready to stain alongside 50 mL shake tubes.
  9. Returned E125s to incubator.   14:42

6-Well-Plates

  1. Collected 6-well-plates from shaker, wiped with ethanol-sprayed Rediwipe, and brought into BSC 15:27
  2. Using a 5 mL serelogial, transferred each cell suspension into 6 x 15 mL tubes. Kept 6-well-plates in BSC, as culture will be returned to vessel after feed. 
  3. Centrifuged 15 mL tubes at 300 x g for 5 min.   15:35 - 15:40 
  4. Aspirated   50 % ( 1.5 mL) of supernatant, taking extra care to not disrupt or aspirate pellet 
  5. Added  1.5 mL  of fresh, warmed growth media
  6. Gently pipette-mixed culture using 5 mL serelogical or P1000, before moving cell suspension back to 6-well-plate
  7. Took 100 uL samples from each culture and stored in separate microtubes until ready to stain alongside 50 mL shake tubes. 
  8. Returned 6-well-plates to incubator.   16:15

  1. Added 100 uL samples from 6-WPs and E-flasks to staining buffer in 96WP ~~  
~~

  2. Added culture IDs to plate map above
  3. Incubated culture in stain at RT in dark for 20 - 30 minutes  15:22 - 15:48   

  4. Performed serial dilution in dPBS to achieve a 12.5% final dilution
  5. Centrifuged the 96-well plate at 650 RCF for 1 minute. Timestamp: 15:50 - 15:51 
  6. Took whole well micrographs using the Zaber microscope on blue & green fluorescence channels (DAPI & 488) 
    * Culture ID images were stored under:   7858 (images labelled "HDACs 6WP")    

  7. Counted total cells (blue fluorescent nuclei, stained with Hoechst33342) and dead cells (green fluorescent nuclei, stained with Sytox green)
