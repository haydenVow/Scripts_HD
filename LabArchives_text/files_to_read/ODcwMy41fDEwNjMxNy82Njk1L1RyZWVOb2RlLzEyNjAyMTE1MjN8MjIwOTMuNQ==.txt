Protocol:


Key learnings from last biopsy:

\- Tissue shrinks in EtOH and iodine.

\- Half the media volume for seeding as it aids attachment (1.5mL for 6 well
plate)

\- Need to increase sterility from the first process.

\- Smaller animal may be better for maintaining sterility.




  1. Collect sacrificed lobster and submerge in 10% Sodium Hypochlorite for 10 mins.
  2. Spray lobster with EtOH three times and leave for five minutes at a time.
  3. Submerge lobster in a shallow bath of ALS + 1X P/S.
  4. Dissect three 3-5g muscle tissues in this bath and wash thrice in ALS + 1X P/S (6 tubes needed)
