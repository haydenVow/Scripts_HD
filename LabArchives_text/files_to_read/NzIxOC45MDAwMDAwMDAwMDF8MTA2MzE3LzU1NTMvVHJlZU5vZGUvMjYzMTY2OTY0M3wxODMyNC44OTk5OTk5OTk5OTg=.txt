### Process:

1\. Took image of vessel with microscope on phase setting.

2\. Aliquotted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then
placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath for a minimum of 20 minutes
prior to use:

  1. TrypLE:   600  mL 
  2.  dPBS (for neutralising):   600  mL
  3.  dPBS (for washing):   600  mL
  4. Growth medium (for pellet resuspension):   30  mL
    * GM = D/F+20%FBS+1xP/S 
  5. Growth media conditions (for seeding):   7 x 60 mL aliquots (1 x 60 mL aliquot/condition)  

Time that all aliquots were placed in the water bath the warm before use
13:35  

Note: if aliquots were placed in water bath at different time, record the time
stamp for each individual solution.




4\. Removed vessel(s) from the incubator

5\. Washed the vessel(s) with dPBS (warmed).

6\. Added  200  mL TrypLE/flask and incubated at 37˚C.

  1. Start/Finish for TrypLE was   14:24 - 14:35     

7\. Neutralised with   200 mL   dPBS/flask and combined cell suspension into
6 x 250 mL  tubes.

8\. Centrifuged at 650 x g for 5 min.

  1. Start/Finish time for centrifugation was   14:46 - 14:51, 14:53 - 14:58    




9\. Aspirated the supernatant(s).

10\. Resuspended pellet(s) in    20   mL   growth   media

11\. Aliquoted   2 x 100 uL  of resuspended cells into a microcentrifuge tube
for cell count. Diluted to 1:50 in trypan blue.  

12\. Performed a cell count using the haemocytometer and recorded the cell
count data in the Google Doc spreadsheet: Cell Count Spreadsheet

  1. Total cell number was:     405,557,500     

  2. Volume of cell suspension required for subculture was:     4.5 mL per 60 mL aliquot, 1.5 mL per E-125     

  3. Cell density per vessel:   ~14M cells/flask = 965,613 cells/mL    




13\. Transferred   4428 µL of cell suspension to each pre-warmed  60  mL
Growth media aliquot  

14\. Transferred 21.5 mL of each aliquot into E-125 flasks (3 reps of 7
conditions = 21 total E-125 flasks)

15\. Took 1 x 100 uL aliquot from each E-125 flask and transferred to 2 x
96-well plate for staining & cell count (see "staining" rich text entry below)

15\. Transferred E-125s to shaking platform (120 RPM) to incubate at:  

  * [x]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (avian cells)
  * [ ]  30ºC, 5% CO2 (reptilian cells)




Staining

Prepared dead stain solution in amber/black centrifuge tube:  
\- 4 mL dPBS  
\- 4 drops Nucgreen AF488 dead stain  
\- Vortex for 5 seconds to mix

Prepared Hoechst stain (50 ug/mL) solution in amber/black centrifuge tube:  
\- 9500 uL MilliQ  
\- 500 uL Hoechst Trihydrochloride trihydrate (1mg/mL)  
\- Vortex for 5 seconds to mix. Solution can be stored at 4°C for up to 6
months

  1. Added 20 uL of Hoechst stain directly to cells
  2. Added 80 uL of dead stain solution (dPBS+Nucgreen) to cells
  3. Incubated for 30 minutes in the dark at room temperature 15:45 - 16:15
  4. Made 4x, 8x and 16x dilutions of the sample in dPBS 
  5. Centrifuged plates at 300 RCF for 1 minute 16:33 - 16:34  
  

  6. Prepared plate map:
