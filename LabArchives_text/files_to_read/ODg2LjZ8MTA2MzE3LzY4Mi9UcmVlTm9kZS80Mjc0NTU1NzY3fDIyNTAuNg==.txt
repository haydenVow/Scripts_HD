Fix Cells, 1 day after seeding.  
Process:

  1. Removed plate(s) `culture IDs:`   6595 + 6596       

  2. Removed media from all wells
  3. Washed wells 2 times in  1 mL of PBS
  4. Added    0.5 mL of 4% PFA to each well and incubate for  `15`  min at room temperature.  11:00-11:15 (6596), 13:50-14:05 (6595)
  5. Washed pieces 2 x more times in PBS at room temperature. `  
`

  6. Aspirate the PBS and leave the cells just covered by fresh PBS.

Janus Green staining

Plate 6596 used

Notes: The addition of diluted hydrochloric acid easily and immediately leads
to dye elution from stained cell layers into the acidic supernatant which
consequently is transferred into 96-well plates and read on a microplate
reader at 595 nm.

Reagents:

  1. Janus Green 0.3% solution in PBS: Mix ID4399
  2. 0.5M HCl: Mix ID4400

Protocol:

  1. Remove any media from the plate containing the adherent cells. 
  2. Add 1X Janus Green Stain (0.3% solution in PBS) per well, sufficient to cover the cells = 0.5 mL in 24-well plate. 
    1. Start: 11:20
  3. Incubate for 5 min at room temperature.
  4. Remove dye, wash 5 times in deionized water (1 mL each wash) or until excess dye is removed.
  5. Remove last water wash, add 0.5 M HCl (sufficient volume to cover the cells/scaffolds) and incubate for 10 min. 11:52-12:02
  6. Transfer 200 uL of the stained HCL into the wells of an untreated 96w plate for plate reader assessment.
  7. Add 200ul of HCL to 4x wells to act as a blank for the plate reader. 
  8. Absorbance read by the Nanostar plate reader at 595nm. 

  




Images: Images were taken of some wells on plate 6596 to demonstrate uptake of
stain prior to HCl exposure.  

Images were taken on phase 5x

Results

The table of data below was produced by the plate reader. The readings
displayed already have the blank value deducted. The line graph was produced
in excel using the mean absorbance reading for each seeding density.
