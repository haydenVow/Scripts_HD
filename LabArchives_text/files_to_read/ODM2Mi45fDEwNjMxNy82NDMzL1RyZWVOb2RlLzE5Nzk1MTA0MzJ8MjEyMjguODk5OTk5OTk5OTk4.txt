  5. pair of scalpels 

Reagents and chemicals checklist (prepared the day prior to biopsy)

  1. Artificial Sea Water (ASW) 
  2. Growth Media 1

Process Biopsy for Animal 2 Gonad 1

  

  1. Take collection media with biopsy into the BSC. 12:03pm
  2. Wash with ASW. 
  3. Section into 4 pieces using a scalpel.  12:01 - 1:05pm
  4. Incubate gonad tissue pieces in collagenase (0.5mg/mL) dissolved in  ASW, stirred for 1 hour 12:06-13:11   

  5. Filter cell suspension through 50 um nylon gauze cell stainer to remove the mature oocytes. 
  6. Washed 50 mL tube containing homogenate with 20 mL ASW and passed wash through the same 50 um nylon gauze cell strainer.
  7. Topped up total volume of filtrate to 50 mL with ASW (15 mL). 
  8. Transferred half of strained cell suspension to a second 50 mL tube
  9. Centrifuged at 300x g for 6 minutes at 15 Â°C   13:28 - 13:33
  10. Resuspend into 36 mL of each culture growth medium. Refer to the below table for medium and plate coating variables. 
  11. Parafilm plates and incubate at 15-19C. 13:45 
  12. 50% feed every 2 days. 

Table 1. Plate map for each 6 well plate condition. Plate setup was repeated
for all 4 6-well plate coatings (no-coating, gelatin, ECM gel, ultra low
attachment)

Explant Culture (Animal 2, biopsy 2)

1\. Gonad from animal 2, biopsy 2 was transferred to a petri dish and
transferred to a BSC 12:16  
2\. Half of the biopsy was transferred to a 100mm petri dish, forceps were
used to press down into plate. 22 mL of urchin media 1 (MIX 10140) was added
to the dish  12:19

3\. Second half of the biopsy was transferred to a 100mm petri dish. 22 mL of
urchin media 1 (MIX 10140) was added to the dish  12:20

4\. Parafilmed culture plates and transferred to Yurt Lab incubator at 17C.

Results:

  * Results were;
    * [ ]  As Usual (this is a repetitive task)
    * [ ]  Unexpected because...
    * [ ]  Need to be further analysed- pending QC results of the wash media tubes that held the biopsies after extraction from the main tissue sample
    * [ ]  Other (.......)
