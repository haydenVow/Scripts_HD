Aim/Purpose


Expand BOBBO MCB cells to a WCB of  ≥ 30M cells.







Continued culture of an initial population of 4.5M BOBBO MCB cells will allow
for a bank of ≥ 30M cells within 2 passages.


Hypothesis


As this is a primary cell line, we have limited understanding of the longer
term proliferative capacity of these cells. The MCB is currently at p4, and we
assume they are capable of expansion to beyond p5.


Technical Gap


1\. A single MCB vial of 4.5M BOBBO cells will be thawed and plated into 4x
T175 flasks (6,430cm/2) in OptiPRO + 4mM Glutamax. Vessels will be cultured at
37C and 5% C02.

2\. Cells will be given a 50% feed 24hrs post thaw, and then approximately
every 72hrs thereafter.

3\. Cells will be passaged when they reach >90% confluence, and re-seeded at
approx. 7,0000cells/cm.

4\. After the first passage, cells will be again be grown to >90% confluence,
before being banked in CryostorCS10 (ACF cryoprotectant).
