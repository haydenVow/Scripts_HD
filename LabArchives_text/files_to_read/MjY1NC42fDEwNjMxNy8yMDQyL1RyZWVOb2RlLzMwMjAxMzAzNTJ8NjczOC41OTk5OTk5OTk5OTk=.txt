Process:

1\. Place the pre-aliquotted  10 mL  mL of each respective type of Growth
Media into the water bath   11:52 am

2\. Placed shake tubes in centrifuge and centrifuge at 650 x g for 5 min at
RT.   13:41 - 13:46 pm

Aspirated supernatant from each pellet

Added 1mL of respective growth media to each tube and used a P1000 pipette to
break up cell clumps.

Remaining 9mL of each respective media was added afterwards and triturated
with 10mL serological pipette to break up cell clumps for each culture further
and resuspend cells evenly.

10uL of each culture taken for viability check

4\. Returned vessel to incubate at:   14:02 pm

  * [X ]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (aviary cells)

  

  * Incubator (#67 ), Lab [Library]

Observations:

Growth Media incl 1:100 ACA - cloudy supernatant + 1 large clump circular
floating and many small flakes

Growth Media incl 1:100 ACA (low serum 5% FBS) - cloudy supernatnat + 1 large
irregularly shaped clump

Growth Media incl 1:100 ACA + RGD Peptide - cloudy supernatant + 1 large clump
circular floating and many small flakes - yellow (acidic)

Growth Media incl 1:100 ACA + YIGSR Peptide - cloudy supernatant + 1 large
clump circular floating and many small flakes - yellow (acidic)

  

 100  % media changed on vessel(s)

  




### Results

  * Results were;
    * [ ]  As Usual (this is a repetitive task)
    * [ ]  Unexpected because...
    * [ X]  Need to be further analysed (this will be graphed along with continual viability and cell count measurements over the course of the experiment to plot cell survival
    * [ ]  Other (.......)
