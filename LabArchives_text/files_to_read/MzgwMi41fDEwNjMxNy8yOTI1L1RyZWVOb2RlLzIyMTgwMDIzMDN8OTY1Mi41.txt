Process:

1\. Placed  20 mL  mL of new Medium #6160 into the water bath  14:08 pm (note*
25mL initially required but only 20mL in bottle. Decided to use 5mL of
supernatant after spin to make up total volume instead of making new media as
it is suspected this may be the last feed).  

2\. Transfer contents of shake flask into a 50mL centrifuge tube.

2a. Centrifuge at 300 x g for 5 min at RT.   14:40pm - 14:45pm  

3\. Aspirated supernatant (collect 5mL of remaining supernatant in a separate
tube). Re-suspended pellets in   0.5 mL   media  and used a P1000 pipette to
break up cell clumps. .

6\. 20 uL taken and cell count performed (see cell count spreadsheet here:
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1DPzKubYxfHmWogVPihC-
SSIBtIylyrBQE5kRX5Z8NtI/edit#gid=1526857572)

7\. Cell count of 8000 cells

8\. Pellets combined in remaining 19.5 mL of warmed medium + 5mL of collected
supernatant (to make up to 25 mL total) and triturated with 10 mL serological
pipette to break up cell clumps and resuspend evenly

9\. Returned 1 x vessel to incubate at:  15:13   Shaking at 130 RPM
