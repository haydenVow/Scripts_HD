Stained and imaged cells adhered to microcarriers

  1. Removed culture(s) from the incubator and placed them in the BSC  `| 16:20 am/pm|`
  2. Swirled culture(s) by hand on the flat surface of the BSC for 5 seconds, the lid was quickly removed and 3x20uL samples of the suspension were taken while the liquid was still in motion. This ensures the carriers were evenly mixed at time of sampling.
  3. Transferred the aliquot(s) to separate wells on a 96 well plate and mixed it with 80uL of dPBS and 20uL/mL of Hoechst 33342. 
  4. Left the 96 well plate to incubate at room temperature, in the dark (away from light), for 20 minutes.  `| 16:33 - 16:58 am/pm |`
  5. After incubation the wells were inspected under the Axio microscope, 5x objective.
  6. Using https://mia-capture.vow.tools/#/, 1 sets of same frame images using the DAPI and PHASE channels were captured for each well `| 17:00 am/pm|`
    1. Manually set the exposure time for DAPI channel to the exposure time seen when carriers are viewed using the automatic exposure adjustment [0.024ms]. (i.e if automatic exposure adjustment reads 0.002ms, set manual adjustment exposure time to be 0.002ms. 
    2. Fluorescence intensity of the UV lamp was adjusted until the centre of each microcarrier was barely visible compared to the space between microcarriers.
  7. Once images were captured, Image pairs were assigned a 'location ID' in MIA capture. (A1-A3, A1 = well 1, A3 = well 3) 
  8. Images captured were then selected for analysis using the 'uCarrier cell count' tool from MIA capture. 

*** Strangely, the MIA count reveals a total of ~ 3M cells in culture before
the passage, when in reality a total of 5.6M were harvested.




### Prepared materials:

1\. Aliquotted the required volume of each reagent (with Poloxamer 188 [1%] -
except Growth Media for resuspension) and then placed all aliquots to warm in
the water bath for a minimum of 20 minutes prior to use:

  1. dPBS (for washing before Trypsinization), 100 mL per g Cytodex 1:    30     mL in     1 x 50mL Falcon    tubes
  2. Trypsin/EDTA, 100 mL per g Cytodex 1:     30    mL in     1 x 50mL Falcon    tubes
  3. Growth media (for neutralizing) 100 mL per g Cytodex 1:     30mL    mL in     1 x 50mL Falcon    tubes
  4. dPBS (for washing microcarriers after Trypsinization), 100 mL per g Cytodex 1:     30mL    mL in     1 x 50mL Falcon   tubes
  5. Growth media (for pellet resuspension):     5    mL in    1 x 15mL Tube     

Time that all aliquots were placed in the water bath the warm before use
16:13   a/pm

Note: if aliquots were placed in water bath at different time, record the time
stamp for each individual solution.




## Remove the flask from incubator

  1. Stop the shaker
  2. Remove the flask from the shaker
  3. Restart the shaker
  4. Wipe down the flask with an ethanol-soaked wipe and place it in the BSC




## First wash to remove serum:

  1. Allow the microcarriers to settle for at least 2 minutes
  2. Gently tilt the flask to an angle of approximately 30 degrees from vertical
  3. Remove the cap and aspirate the supernatant using a serological pipet - keep the tip only 5-10 mm below the surface during this procedure
  4. Transfer half of the fresh, pre-warmed dPBS fro prewashing to the flask using a serological pipet - wash down the insides to wash any stuck microcarriers back into the bulk suspension, then replace the cap

  




## Second wash to remove serum:

  1. Allow the microcarriers to settle for at least 2 minutes
  2. Gently tilt the flask to an angle of approximately 30 degrees from vertical
  3. Remove the cap and aspirate the supernatant using a serological pipet - keep the tip only 5-10 mm below the surface during this procedure
  4. Transfer the remaining half of the fresh, pre-warmed dPBS for prewashing to the flask using a serological pipet - wash down the insides to wash any stuck microcarriers back into the bulk suspension, then replace the cap

  




## Add detachment agent:

  1. Allow the microcarriers to settle for at least 2 minutes
  2. Gently tilt the flask to an angle of approximately 30 degrees from vertical
  3. Remove the cap and aspirate the supernatant using a serological pipet - keep the tip only 5-10 mm below the surface during this procedure
  4. Transfer the fresh, pre-warmed Trypsin/EDTA solution to the flask using a serological pipet - wash down the insides to wash any stuck microcarriers back into the bulk suspension, then replace the cap

  




## Incubate flask:

  1. Stop the shaker
  2. Remove the flask from the BSC and transfer it back to the shaker
  3. Restart the shaker at the `speed required for detachment` \- 195 RPM
  4. After `7-15 `minutes, stop the shaker
  5. Remove the flask from the shaker
  6. Restart the shaker
  7. Wipe down the flask with an ethanol-soaked wipe and place it in the BSC

Observations/Summary:

Remaining cells were discarded so as to not overseed the E250 vessel prior to
SCC. It appears from DAPI images that carriers were fairly overconfluent which
could affect the viability of the clones generated from the SCC run on the
31st.
