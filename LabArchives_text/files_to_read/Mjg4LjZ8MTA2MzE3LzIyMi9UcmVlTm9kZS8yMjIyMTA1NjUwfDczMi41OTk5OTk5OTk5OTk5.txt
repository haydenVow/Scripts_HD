Assessing adhesion of MuSCs onto fibroblast-laden scaffolds


Aim:

To determine whether the addition or absence of fibroblasts on zein scaffolds,
and the addition or absence of Vitamin C will assist in the prolonged adhesion
of Muscle stem cells onto the zein scaffolds throughout differentiation.




Fibroblasts generate collagen which can act as an adhesive for MuSCs,
indicating that a co-culture system may improve adhesion of MuSCs.  
  
Vow has run experiments looking at the adhesion of MuSCs onto fibroblast-laden
zein scaffolds, which we will be re-attempting in this experiment.

As per this background section, Vitamin C has been shown to be a promising
molecule to add to growth media of fibroblasts to encourage collagen
production which may assist in the adhesion of MuSCs when added on top of the
fibroblasts.

  

For this experiment Vitamin C (aka L-ascorbic acid) will be supplemented at a
concentration of 50ug/mL to the cultures from the time of seeding fibroblasts
until adding mitomycin to halt fibroblast growth (first 3.5 days of culture).
This will be in an attempt to encourage collagen production for the first few
days while the fibroblasts are actively proliferating, and then will be
withdrawn from the growth media when MuSCs are added.
