DMEM/F12 + 20% FBS + 1 x P/S media was aliquoted for adherent cultures  

  * 3xT75cm plate per knockout  condition/nucleofection control (12mL per flask).  
  * 2x 96 wp, 1 for each knockout condition (200uL per well).

3 x T75 plates = 36mL

2x 96 well plates = 38.4mL

Total = 74.4 x 1.1 = ~82 mL

  




PREPARE FACS BUFFER

  1. Buffer used was made for Nucleofection Round 1, Run 2, Buffer was sterile filtered and used once again was Stored at 4ÂºC until transport to FACS sorting facilit, fridge in Library lab. bottom shelf on fridge door




PREPARE DESTINATION VESSELS

  1. 6 x 96 well ultra low attachment plates were filled with 200uL of Hycell Cho growth media containing FGF-b, IGF1-LR3 and KSR. 
  2. 2x 96 well adherent plates were filled with 200uL of DMEM/F12 + 20% FBS + 1xP/S growth media. 
  3. plate edges were parafilmed and plates were left in the fridge in library lab at 4 degrees until use on 18/2/2022.
