## Performed by: LL  




Reagent preparation:

1\. Centrifuged the secondary antibody stock using the benchtop
microcentrifuge for 10 seconds.

2\. Prepared Secondary Antibody mixes (pipette from the top/supernatant of
antibody solution):

Mix 1

 1 µL   Secondary #1   (1:1000) +  1 µL   Secondary #2   (1:1000 ) +  998 uL
Blocking Buffer (PBST (0.1% Triton X + dPBS) + 3% BSA)  

Mix 2

  2 µL   Secondary #1   (1:500) +  2 µL   Secondary #2   (1:500) +  996  mL
Blocking Buffer (PBST (0.1% Triton X + dPBS) + 3% BSA)  

Pipette-mixed antibody mix and stored refrigerated away from light until
needed.

3\. Prepared DAPI mix:

 1 mL  PBS +  1 uL  of DAPI

Vortexed DAPI mix and stored refrigerated away from light until needed.




Process:

1\. Aspirated primary antibody mix

2\. Washed 3 times for 5 min with PBS at RT.

 13:13 - 13:18

 13:19 - 13:24  

 13:25 - 13:32  

4\. Added secondary antibody mixture. Add 1:500 dilution mix to half the
scaffolds, and 1:1000 to the other half. Incubate in the dark at RT for 1
hour. Placed in black box to protect from light.  13:33 - 14:32

NOTE: from this step onwards protect from the light by wrapping plates in foil
and perform experiment in the dark.




Counter staining

1\.  Removed 2nd antibody solution.  14:32

2\.  Washed with DAPI (1:1000) in PBS for 5 min at RT in the dark.

 14:33 - 14:38

3\.  Washed in PBS 3 x 5 min at RT in the dark. (No Triton)

 14:39 - 14:45

 14:46 - 14:51

4\.  Replaced dPBS.

 14:51

5\. Confirmed staining on microscope by imaging.
