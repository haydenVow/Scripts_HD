## Begin EStim Process:

Open Arduino (search in 'Activities'). This should open the previously used
script in the Micromanager, which should be 'stimjimPulser.ino'. If this
script does not open, it can be opened by heading to
Home>Arduino<stimjimPulser>stimjimPulser.ino and opening this file.

In the Arduino script, comments are denoted with two forward slashes --> //  
Code which runs operations on the StimJim microcontroller does not have these
forward slashes.

  

To run a test run of the stimulation

#### Uncomment the two lines of code, underneath the comment --> //check if
the pulseTrain is finished; if so, exit  
By using two forward slash keys --> //

Like so:  

Click Verify to check the code is still accepted and no mistakes have been
made:

Click Upload to upload the firmware onto the StimJim microcontroller.

####  

#### To run the stimulation non-stop

#### Comment out the two lines of code underneath the comment --> //check if
the pulseTrain is finished; if so, exit  
By using two forward slash keys --> //

Like so:  

Click Verify to check the code is still accepted and no mistakes have been
made:

## Cleaning the Electrodes

When finished with the electrode lid, it will need to be cleaned and stored
away for later use.

1\. Inspect the wiring connections to the electrode to ensure no corrosion or
damage is present and all wiring is still connected as expected.  
2\. Inspect the electrodes closely to ensure no damage or dissolution has
occurred to the metal.  
3\. Spray down the used electrode lid with ethanol.  
4\. Fill the wells of a clean 12WP base with ethanol and place the electrode
plate in this base so the electrodes are immersed in ethanol.

A spare 'wash plate' is kept in the 'Electrodes' box.

5\. Place the 12WP assembly inside the ultrasonic bath so that the water of
the bath is at the line where the 12WP lid meets the base.  
6\. Set the ultrasonic bath temperature to room temperature and the time of
sonication for 15 minutes.  
7\. Reinspect the electrodes. If any media or other organic residue is still
present on the electrodes, repeat step 6.  
8\. Store the electrode lid by placing it onto a clean 12WP base. Ensure the
lid is dry before storage. Optional: Place the lid in the drying oven upside
down at 50C for 15 minutes to increase drying time.  Alternatively, to reuse
the lid immediately, proceed to the UV sterilisation process.
