Growth Media:

  * [X]  DMEM/F12 + 20% FBS + 1X P/S + P38i (10uM)




### Process:

1\. Took image of vessel with microscope on phase setting, took images of each
flask (2 images captured under phase 4x objective.

  1. Time when all vessels(s)  removed incubator       13:59   a/pm 

3\. Aliquotted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then
placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath for a minimum of 20 minutes
prior to use:

  1. TrypLE:    20     mL in     1 x 50mL    tubes
  2.  dPBS (for washing and neutralising):     40    mL in   1 x 50mL     tubes
  3. Growth media (for pellet resuspension):     3mL    mL in     1 x 15mL    tubes
  4. Growth media (for seeding):    N/A (E125 has been equilibrated previously)     mL in     N/A    tubes

Time that all aliquots were placed in the water bath the warm before use
13:58   a/pm

Note: if aliquots were placed in water bath at different time, record the time
stamp for each individual solution.




4\. Removed vessel(s) from the incubator     14:25   a/pm

5\. Washed the vessel(s) with dPBS (warmed).

6\. Added     10    mL tryple to each vessel/well and incubated at 37˚C.

  1. Start/Finish for TrypLE was     14:30   a/pm 
  2. Checked for cell detachment at 14:35 and observed 50% cell detachment.  

  3. Checked for cell detachment at 14:40 and observed 80% cell detachment.  

  4. Cells neutralised at 14:47  

7\. Neutralised with     10mL     dPBS and combined cell suspension into a
1 x 50mL    tube.

8\. Centrifuged at 650 x g for 5 min.

  1. Start/Finish time for centrifugation was     14:53 - 14:58   a/pm 




9\. Aspirated the supernatant(s).

10\. Resuspended pellet(s) in     1    mL     GM     media     15:10   a/pm

11\. Aliquoted      20uL    of resuspended cells into a microcentrifuge tube
for cell count.

12\. Performed a cell count using the haemocytometer and recorded the cell
count data below in the Seed Calculator.  




13\. Removed 12.77mL of equilibrated medium containing carriers from the
previously equilibrated E125 to account 3 cells per carrier (due to not enough
cells harvested from 2 x T175)

Transferred      1     mL of cell suspension to the equilibrated 17.22mL of
culture in the E125:      15:37    a/pm

16\. Transferred vessel(s) to shake at 110RPM checking to see if carriers were
in suspension and not pelleted.  

  * [X]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (avian cells)

Observations/Summary:

\- Not enough cells to seed E125 at normal density and hence 12.77mL of
carrier suspension was removed to seed 1M cells.

Version Change Log

NameChange Details  
V1 (original)N/A  
V2Changed all sentences to past tense to better reflect a hand-written lab
book entry.  
Various formatting changes.  
Addition of more detail to step 2, removal of step 3. Replaced volume
requirements table with updated volumes @Sep 22, 2020  
Updated temperature selection for mammalian/aviary cells @Sep 23, 2020  
V3Included a section for 'vessel type' in passage ID table Replace
'flask/plate' with 'vessel' throughout lab book Include at step 1 to take
