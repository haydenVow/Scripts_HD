Literature has shown recently that low concentration (5 mg/mL) gelatin
promotes proliferation, fusion and maturation of primary myoblasts as well as
C2C12 cells. While low concentrations of gelatin seem to be beneficial, high
concentrations appear to be just the opposite. Gelatin interestingly presents
a hormetic/biphasic effect on myogenesis and muscle regeneration which we hope
to investigate at Vow.

Abstract:

Skeletal muscle regeneration requires extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling
including an acute and transient breakdown of collagen that produces gelatin.
However, the physiological function of such a remodeling process on muscle
tissue repair is unclear. Here we elaborate on a bi-phasic effect of gelatin
in skeletal muscle regeneration, mediated by hormetic effects of reactive
oxygen species (ROS). Low-dose gelatin stimulates ROS production from NADPH
oxidase 2 (NOX2) and simultaneously upregulates antioxidant system for
cellular defense, reminiscent of the adaptive compensatory process during mild
stress. This response triggers the release of myokine IL-6 which stimulates
myogenesis and facilitates muscle regeneration. By contrast, high-dose gelatin
stimulates ROS overproduction from NOX2 and mitochondrial chain complex, and
ROS accumulation by suppressing antioxidant system, triggering release of
TNF, which inhibits myogenesis and regeneration. Our findings reveal gelatin-
ROS-IL-6/TNFα signaling cascades underlying a hormetic response of myogenic
cells to gelatin.
