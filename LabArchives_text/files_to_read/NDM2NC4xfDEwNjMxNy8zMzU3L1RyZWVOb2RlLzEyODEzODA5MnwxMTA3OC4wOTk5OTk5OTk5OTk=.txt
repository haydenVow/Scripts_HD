  1. Thaw cells into 2 x T75s with the following media conditions:  
    1. D/F+10%KSR+0.1xP/S+110 ng/mL IGF + 10 ng/mL TGF-B + 30 ng/mL FGF-B + 2.5 ng/mL PDGF-BB (immediate thaw into ACF-medium) 
    2. D/F+10%FBS+1xP/S 
  2. Passage into 6 x T25s as such:
    1. Control x 2 
    2. KSR x 2 
    3. 50% KSR + 50% Control x 2 
  3. Continue to serially passage 50/50 culture in increasing concentrations of 10%KSR medium. 
    1. For serial adaptation condition(s), follow this passaging schedule from 10% FBS to 10% KSR medium:
  4. Once cells are proliferating in 10% KSR medium, transfer to suspension culture
