The Nuvonis Cell Supply group was formed to provide enough cells for the
Second Product team to conduct their experiments smoothly.

We plan to Seed/Feed/Expand on Mondays (AM) and Thursdays (PM) which provides
the team ample time to prepare for their experiments.

The following entries provide the protocol for Seed/Feed/Expanding cells as
well as the quantities used.
