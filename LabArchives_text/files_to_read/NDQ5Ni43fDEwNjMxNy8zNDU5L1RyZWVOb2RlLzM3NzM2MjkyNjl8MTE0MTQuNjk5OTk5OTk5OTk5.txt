Process:

  1. Place the media blocks in an incubator to warm up media   10:12 am 
  2. Please check plates under microscope to ensure there are cells in both plates. Note down yes/no in the "Observations" section below.
  3. Briefly spin the 96 deep-well media blocks down in the centrifuge to collect all the media. 20 seconds at 800g is appropriate.
  4. Removed   100 % of supernatant from vessel. Change tips for each column.
  5. Replaced with   140uL (per well/per vessel) of   DSD  media. Change tips for each column.
  6. Returned vessel to incubate at:

  * [X]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (aviary cells)

  

  * Incubator (Sanyo bottom), Lab [Main]

Please foil wrap DSD media blocks after feed and place back in Biomaterials
fridge
