Took samples

  1. Unscrewed the "BENCHMARK" sample tube cover.
  2. Sprayed down the tube end with 70% ethanol.
  3. Connecedt a 5 mL sterile syringe.
  4. Withdrew slightly more than 3 mL (to purge the line).
  5. Discarded the 5 mL syringe.
  6. Connected a fresh sterile syringe and withdrew 3.5 - 4.0 mL of sample.
  7. Disconnected sample syringe and transferred 1 mL of sample each to 3 x 1.5 mL Eppendorf tubes for subsequent analysis.
  8. Sprayed sample tube end and cap with 70% ethanol, re-attached cap.

Stained and imaged cells adhered to microcarriers

  1. Added 1 drop of Hoechst 33342 ReadyProbes reagent to each 1 mL sample
  2. Mixed each tube by vortexing at minimum speed for 3 seconds
  3. Left the tubes lying their sides in a dark place at room temperature for 10 - 20 minutes.  `| 17:15 - 17:25 |`
  4. Mixed each tube by vortexing at minimum speed for 3 seconds
  5. Transferred 20 - 100 uL of the even suspension to a well in a 96 well plate
  6. Added 0 - 80 uL of PBS to make the volume up to 100 uL
  7. Inspected the wells under the Axio microscope, 5x objective.
  8. If the microcarriers overlapped then further diluted the samples
  9. Using https://mia-capture.vow.tools/#/, took 3 sets of same frame images using the DAPI and PHASE channels for each well `| : am/pm|`
  10. Once images were captured, Image pairs were assigned a 'location ID' in MIA capture. 
  11. Images captured were then selected for analysis using the 'uCarrier cell count plastic' tool from MIA capture. 

  




Nuclear Ejection

  1. Removed 0.9 mL of the supernatant from the 1.5mL tubes carefully without aspirating the microcarriers.

  2. Washed microcarriers using 0.9 mL of room temperature Dulbecco's phosphate buffered saline without Ca2+ and Mg2+ (DPBS-/-).
  3. Aspirated and discarded the dPBS wash.
  4. Added 0.9 mL of cell lysis solution to the microcarriers
  5. Vortexed the 1.5 mL tube for 1 min at maximum speed to release nuclei.
  6. Loaded 10uL of each Hoechst stained sample onto a countess slide and took three images of separate locations under the DAPI imaging channel on the Axio under the 5x objective.
  7. Calculated the cells/mL by converting the cells/mm2 value shown in MIA capture
