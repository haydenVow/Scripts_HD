Growth Media:

  *   

  * [ x]  DMEM/F12 + 20% FBS + 1X P/S + P38i (10uM)
  *   

Total media required:120 ml

Total p38i required:60uL

  




Process:

1\. Aliquotted   120mL  mL of  growth Media into    240   urine container(s).
Placed in water bath   11:40

2\. Removed 100   % of supernatant from vessel.

3\. Replaced with   30mL (per well/per vessel) of   growth  media.

4\. Returned vessel to incubate at:

  * [x]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
