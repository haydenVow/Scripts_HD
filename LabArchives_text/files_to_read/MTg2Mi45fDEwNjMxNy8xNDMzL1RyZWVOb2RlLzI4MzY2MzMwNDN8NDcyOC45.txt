1\. Prepared    40mL  PBST (0.2% Triton-X)

2\. Prepared    10mL  blocking buffer: PBST (0.1% Triton-X + PBS) + 3% bovine
serum albumin (BSA). (Kept in the fridge until needed in blocking step)

3\. Prepared Primary Antibody Mix:  20 µL   Primary #1 MyoG (Santa Cruz)
(1:200  ) +  80 µL   Primary #2 MF20 (DSHB)   (1:50  ) +  3.9  mL Blocking
Buffer

Vortexed antibody mix for 5 seconds and stored refrigerated away from light
until needed.

Process:

Permeabilise

1\. Removed PBS from each well.

2\. Added  100 µL PBST (0.2% Triton-X) to each well for 15 min:  14:10 - 14:28
pm

3\. Aspirated PBST for each well.




Blocking

1\. Added  100 µL of blocking buffer (3% BSA in PBST [0.1% Triton-X]) and
incubate for 45 minutes - 1hr at RT. (no more than 1 hour):   14:32 - 15:17
a/pm




Single/Simultaneous Primary Antibody staining

1\. Removed blocking buffer from each well.

2\. Incubated cells with primary antibody for 90min - 2hrs at RT, or 4ºC
overnight:   15:35 - Overnight a/pm

3\. Parafilmed plates and stored at 4ºC in tissue culture lab Fridge.

After this step, all further task should be performed in a dark room. The
vessel should also be wrapped foil when not used.
