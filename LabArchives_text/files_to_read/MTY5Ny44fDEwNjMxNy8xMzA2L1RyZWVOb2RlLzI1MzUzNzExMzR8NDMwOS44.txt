1\. Aliquotted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then
placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath for a minimum of 20 minutes
prior to use:

  *  Growth media (for seeding):   60 mL in 1x 70 mL   pot   

  * Time that aliquot was placed in the water bath to warm before use:  10:40

## Thaw and seed vial:

3\. Collected the cryovial from Liquid Nitrogen storage & place in foam
floater in water bath for 5 min  10:55 - 11:00

Location where cryovial was collected from:

Vial details:  2  x  F_WCB  cryovials at   1M  cells each for a total of    2M
cells

Brew

Tower/Bucket # 1

Box/Cane # 2

Vial location: A7, A8  

Vial ID(s): 2285-Culture-6303-Vial-6of115, 2286-Culture-6303-Vial-7of115  

`4. Ethanol sprayed & transferred the vial(s) to the BSC.`

`5.  Added  500 µL of Growth Media (to generate a total volume of 1mL in the
cryovial) to the cryovial, resuspended the cell suspension gently to reduce
osmotic shock. `

`6. Collected the entire 1mL of cell suspension & transfer into the pre-warmed
tube of Growth Media. `

`7. Using a 10mL serological pipette, resuspended & distributed the cells
evenly in the  60 mL of pre-warmed Growth Media (prepared in Step 2). `

`8. Transfered  30 mL to each  T175  flask.`

`9. Transfered flask/plate(s) to incubate at: `

  * [x]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (aviary cells)

  

Making labels

Note - You will need to increase the passage number by one. (i.e. if your
thawed vial ID has a passage number of 3, when you make a culture ID for you
vessel you will need change the passage number to 4 on Airtable.)

### Results:

  * Results were;
    * [x]  As Usual (this is a repetitive task)
    * [ ]  Unexpected because...
    * [ ]  Need to be further analysed
    * [ ]  Other (.......)
