Note: A lot of debris has been observed across all out WALLE cultures. Spent
media is not overly discolored and does not have an odor. To assess the
possibility of contamination, 100ul was of spent media was collected from 1
well of each culture, and transferred to separate wells of a 6-well plate.
Media was topped up to 3ml in each well and and the plate was incubated at 37C
with 5% C02. These cultures will be observed over the coming days for
indicators of contamination.
