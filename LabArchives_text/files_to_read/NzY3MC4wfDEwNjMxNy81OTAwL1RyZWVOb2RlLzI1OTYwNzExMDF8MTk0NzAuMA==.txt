Key Result(s)
  
  
This CHOMP09 fibroblast expansion was maintained in culture for 26 days and
underwent 4 passages. The average doubling time over the course of the
expansion was 2.84 days  A WCB of 746M cells was banked in the form of 50 x
10M vials, 40x 5M vials and 23 x 2M vials.


Discussion of Results


The generation of this WCB demonstrates that CHOMP09 fibroblasts can be
expanded to sufficient numbers to meet the current demands of both the
Production and Science teams. The doubling times of these cells did not slow
during the expansion, indicating that the cells have not yet reached their
proliferative capacity.


Limitations


This F_COMP09 WCB will eventually be exhausted and a new WCB will need to be
generated. While the CHOMP09 fibroblasts did not show a decline in
proliferation over the course of this expansion, we currently do not have any
idea of the proliferative limits of these cells. A longevity study to assess
these limits will be conducted for both CHOMP07 and CHOMP09. See lab book

As an additional source of F_CHOMP cells, we may also look to the F_CHOMP07,
for which we are also generating a WCB. See lab book here: https://au-

Conclusion(s)


A WCB of 746M F_CHOMP09 cells was banked.


Future Direction(s)


The  F_CHOMP09 WCB will be used for production runs and by the science team.
When this WCB has been exhausted, additional MCB to WCB expansions may be
required.
