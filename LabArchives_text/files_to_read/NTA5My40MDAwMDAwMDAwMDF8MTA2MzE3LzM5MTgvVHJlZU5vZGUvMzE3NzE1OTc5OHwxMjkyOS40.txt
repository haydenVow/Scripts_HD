Important info:

  * The media for this feed is in a foil sealed 96 well plastic block
  * Each well is a completely different media condition - please change tips for every aspirate and dispense!
  * A1 of media block corresponds to A1 of plate and so on and so forth - please make sure the plates and media blocks are the right way up before you start the feed to ensure the right wells get the right media

Process:

  1. Remove DSD media blocks (main block and control block) from the fridge and placed in the incubator for 60 mins or float in waterbath for 30 min 14:05 Briefly centrifuged DSD media blocks (20 sec)
  2. Checked plates under Primo to ensure cells are healthy and alive. Please note in "Observations" the condition of the cells . 
  3. Removed  100  % of supernatant from vessel. Ensure some liquid is leftover in the well so the cells don`t dry out! Immediately add the fresh respective DSD media
  4. Replaced with  140  (per well/per vessel) of their respective growth  media. Each well is a different condition. Make sure to change tips for every aspirate and dispense with your multichannel.
  5. Foil sealed media block (foil seals located on the shelf above the Primo)  \- and placed back in Biomaterials fridge for future feeds. Alternatively, you can seal the plates with sterile rubber mats and parafilm.
  6. Returned vessel to incubate at: 15:58
    * [X]  37ÂºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
    * Incubator (# 81 ), Lab [Main]
