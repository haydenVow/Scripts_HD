RELATED TO MILESTONE:  KR1 Develop and complete â‰¥1 run of a HTP platform for
cell density & viability analysis of >90 suspension cultures.

AIM/PURPOSE: To determine which factors (species, basal media, anti-clumping
agent, KSR, pluronic, FBS) interact in which concentrations to optimally help
fibroblasts adapt to suspension culture.

HYPOTHESIS: That DoE will shed new light into how different factors interact
and support adaptation of fibroblasts to suspension culture

RESULTS SUMMARY:

  * No cells were adapted to suspension
  * F_NANDO3 total cell counts were consistently higher than F_DOLLY12 cell counts
  * Increasing the concentration of anti-clumping agent lead to a decrease in total cell count 
  * Most cultures were terminated at day 28 due to persistently low cell counts
  * The remaining 12 cultures (triplicates from 4 conditions) were terminated at day 42 due to persistently low cell counts

CONCLUSIONS:

The conditions tested were not appropriate for adaptation of F_DOLLY12 or
F_NANDO3 cells to suspension. However:

  1. F_NANDO3 appears to survive better than F_DOLLY12 during suspension adaptation
  2. Anti-clumping agent appears unnecessary for suspension adaptation

NEXT STEPS:

  * Identify and fix the cause of the blue fluorescent debris that interferes with total cell counting - see EPIC26777
  * Use E125 flasks and discontinue use of 50 mL bioreactor tubes for suspension adaptation of F_DOLLY12
  * Discontinue suspension adaptation of F_NANDO3 due to lack of WCB vials
  * Discontinue use of anti-clumping agent in suspension adaptation experiments
