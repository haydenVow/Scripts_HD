### Process:

1\. Took image of vessel with microscope on phase setting.

2\. Aliquotted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then
placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath for a minimum of 20 minutes
prior to use:

  1. TrypLE:   10  mL in    2 x 15 mL   tubes (5 mL in each)   

  2.  dPBS (for neutralising & washing):   40  mL in 2 x 50 mL tubes (20 in each)   

  3. Growth media (for pellet resuspension):   8  mL in 2 x 15 mL tubes (4 in each  

  4. Growth media (for seeding):   18 & 21 mL in2 x 15 mL tubes   

Time that all aliquots were placed in the water bath the warm before use
14:03  

Note: if aliquots were placed in water bath at different time, record the time
stamp for each individual solution.




4\. Removed vessel(s) from the incubator     14:15   a/pm

5\. Washed the vessel(s) with dPBS (warmed).

6\. Added   0.2  mL tryple to eachwell and incubated at 30˚C.

  1. Start/Finish for TrypLE (UV plates) was    14:23 - 14:34    

  2. Start/Finish for TrypLE (P53i plate) was    14:42 - 14:52    

7\. Neutralised with    0.5 mL    dPBS and combined cell suspension into    13
x 15 mL   tubes

8\. Centrifuged at 650 x g for 5 min.

  1. Start/Finish time for centrifugation (UV plates) was     14:57 - 15:03     

  2. Start/Finish time for centrifugation (P53i plate) was     15:23 - 15:28  




9\. Aspirated the supernatant(s).

10\. Resuspended pellet(s) in    0.2  mL    growth    medium

11\. Aliquoted    10 uL  of resuspended cells into a microcentrifuge tube for
cell count.

12\. Performed a cell count using the haemocytometer and recorded the cell
count data in the Google Doc spreadsheet: Cell Count Spreadsheet or cell count
widget below

NOTE: performed an extra cell count for 30 nM P53i treatment due to low cell
number but achieved very similar count

13\. Transferred cell suspensions to the pre-warmed Growth media

14\. Transferred cell suspension into the   2 x 6-WPs and 1 x 96WP  

15\. Transferred vessel(s) to incubate at:

  * [x] 30'C, 5% CO2 (reptilian cells)
  * [ ]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (avian cells)




Observations/Summary:

1) Cell count of 30 nM concentration of P53i treatment was unexpectedly low,
and an outlier for the P53i conditions. We suspect that the cells were somehow
lost during the passage, as all replicates of cells in all P53i conditions
looked relatively similar in terms of confluence.

2) UV control had a lower count than all but highest UV-exposed cell
conditions. We suspect that this is due to heat exposure over the 12.5 minute
irradiation.

3) Cells in all but 30 nM P53i treatments and controls had very similar
counts, indicating that P53i and DMSO in the quantities tested do not
negatively impact cell growth.

4) Cells in the lowest UV-irradiated treatment (5 mj/cm2) had the highest cell
count for UV conditions, whereas cells in highest UV-irradiated treatment (300
mj/cm2) had the lowest cell count
