### Process:






4\. Aspirated and discarded media from each flask

5\. Washed the vessel(s) with 10mL dPBS (room temp)

6\. Discarded washes then added    10     mL tryple to each vessel/well and
incubated at 30ËšC, 5% CO2 for 12 minutes, shaking at 120rpm  

7\. Neutralised with     10     dPBS and combined cell suspension into a
2x50mL    tubes (one tube with cultures 12444+12445 and one with 12446+12447),
40mL total each tube.  

Took 20uL of each resuspension for a cell count as per instructions below.




CELL COUNT

12\. Performed a cell count using the haemocytometer and recorded the cell
count data in the Google Doc spreadsheet: Cell Count Spreadsheet or cell count
widget below.

SSIBtIylyrBQE5kRX5Z8NtI/edit#gid=0&range=2399:2400

  1. Total cell number for cultures 12444 and 12445:      14,240,000      

  2. Total cell number for cultures 12446 and 12447:      16,320,000    (see banking procedure below)  

  3. Volume of cell suspension required for subculture from cultures 1244+12445 was 3.48mL  

    1. 3.48mL of cell suspension was transferred to 30mL of growth media inside a fresh T175 flask 
    2. Cell density per vessel:    7085 cells/cm^2     
    3. Flask was transferred to incubate at 30 degrees 5% CO2, incubator 140.  




Banking.

For cell suspension containing contents of 12446 and 12447, cells were
centrifuged at  500g for 5 minutes.

13\. Resuspended cells in 16mL of CryostorCS10 media.  

14\. Transferred cell suspension into 8 cryotubes, 2mL each tube. (~1x10^6
cells/mL)

15\. Cells were transferred toa  Mr frosty and left in the -80 freezer in the
main lab.
