Perform feed using below volumes:

  




Differentiation Media:

  * E6  
  
Total media required: 48 mL




Culture IDs to feed

Vessel type(s)Vessel ID  
12 well plate  
7450-DOLLY12-Sheep P10-1of2  
7451-DOLLY12-Sheep P10-2of2  
  
  
  




Process:

1\. Aliquoted  1x 48 mL  mL of  E6 Dif Media into  1x 50mL  tube(s). Labelled
aliquots with the feed date and 'EPIC21489'.  
Placed aliquots in media fridge 74 in main lab 15:00 03/08  

2\. Aliquots placed in water bath   11:55 - 12:55  

3\. Removed the hook test clips from the electrode connection pins on the
culture dish lids and imaged in the zaber  12:20 - 12:35 (7450), 12:40 - 12:55
(7451)

The test hook can be released from the pin by squeezing the spring loaded test
hook handle. It is best not to touch the metal electrode pins while doing
this. Hold the plastic culture dish lid for stability. If any wires become
dislodged and the operator is unsure about reattachment, contact experiment
owner for assistance   Jared - 0420881185

4\. Moved culture dishes to the BSC.  12:55  

5\. Removed and placed the electrode culture lid on its back inside the
incubator to keep the electrodes sterile.

6\.  100% of supernatant from the vessel was removed.

7\. Replaced with  2mL (per well/per vessel) of  E6 Dif  media.

8\. Returned vessel to incubate and connected the test hooks back up to the
electrode pins on the culture dish lid so that each set of hooks connects to
the corresponding wire colour and so that the black hooks are aligned on the
left side of each well and the red hooks on the right (see wiring setup
reference image below)   13:15
