AIM/PURPOSE: The overarching goal is to expand the Vows existing cell library
to include a broader range of species. Here, we aim to isolate a plastic
adherent population of cells from wallaby muscle tissue. These cells will then
be expanded to form a master cell bank (MCB) and working cell bank (WCB).

HYPOTHESIS:

  1. 12 Vials of WALLE crude homogenate will be frozen down after digesting 4 biopsies, following Vows established protocols for cell isolation.
  2. Plastic adherent populations of cells will be established via immediate culture of WALLE crude homogenate. 
  3. The plastic adherent population of WALLE cells will be expanded in culture to an MCB of â‰¥ 15M cells. 

RESULTS SUMMARY:

  1. 12 Vials of WALLE crude homogenate were frozen down from 4 biopsies, following Vows established protocols for cell isolation.
  2. Plastic adherent populations of cells were established via immediate culture of WALLE02 and WALLE04 crude homogenate, and were first observed after 14 days in culture. We were unable to establish plastic adherent populations from WALLE03 and WALLE05 isolates.  WALLE03 and WALLE05 were therefore terminated after 24 days in culture.   

  3. The plastic adherent population of WALLE02 and WALLE04 ceased to proliferate after passaging and were therefore terminated after 40 days in culture.

CONCLUSIONS:  
While we were successful in establishing an adherent cell population from 2 of
our 4 biopsies, we were unable to maintain these cells in long term culture
and to expand them to a population of  >15M cells in order to bank an MCB.
This suggests that our current isolation and culture conditions are not
optimised for use with adherent primary cells derived from wallaby muscle
tissue. It is possible that our current techniques and media conditions, which
were originally designed for mammalian cells, are not suitable for the
isolation and culture of  primary cells derived from marsupial tissue.

NEXT STEPS:  
A literature review should be performed in order to determine if our isolation
and protocols can be optimised for future marsupial biopsies. A new wallaby
should then be sourced, and another biopsy and isolation should be carried
out.
