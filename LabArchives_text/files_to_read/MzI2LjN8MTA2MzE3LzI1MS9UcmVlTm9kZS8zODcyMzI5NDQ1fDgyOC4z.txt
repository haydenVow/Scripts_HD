Process:

1\. Place pre-aliquotted  45 mL  mL of  Growth Media into water bath. Placed
in water bath  11:49 am

  1. Media labelled as SUN FEED and stored in 104 short fridge in library lab.
  2. Media does not require p38i so no need to add.

2\. Removed  50 % of supernatant from each vessel.

3\. Replaced with  15 mL (per vessel) of  Growth media.

4\. Returned vessel to incubate at:  `12:39 pm`

  * [x]  37ÂºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * [x]  Top Binder Incubator
