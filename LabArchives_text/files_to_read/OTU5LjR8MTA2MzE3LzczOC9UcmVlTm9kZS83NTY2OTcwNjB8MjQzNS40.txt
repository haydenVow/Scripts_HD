### Process:

Intermittent agitation to facilitate adhesion

  1. Allowed microcarriers to settle in equilibrated E250 and aspirated 11.5mL of Growth Media.
  2. Transferred   11.5mL  of cell suspension (attach passage entry here) containing `12.5 million cells` into   48.5mL of equilibrated microcarrier suspension in the culture vessel to make up a total working volume of 60mL.

  1. Transferred vessel to incubate at:

  * [X]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (aviary cells)




  

  1. Began the seeding schedule for 6 hours (below) using the KASA app.
    1. The minimum required agitation speed for shaken cultures to maintain the microcarriers in suspension can be estimated using this calculator: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/18NrC_xaJ2I87B4x3vTE46Z-ZUS3EV0Gw-CnM0DcukL4/edit?usp=sharing
      * Shake speed used = 120RPM
    2. The seeding schedule may be reduced or extended by removing or adding 30 minute cycles as required. Generally, at least 3 but up to 12 hours are required to allow the maximum number of the inoculated cells to adhere.

  1. At the conclusion of the seeding period the vessel was left to shake continuously overnight.

### Observations/Summary:

\- Cells were overseeded at 12.5M cells in order to produce a healthy
indication of pre and post harvest images (when harvest occurs in the future).
As opposed to normal seeding which may not provide a indication of cells
present on microcarriers before and after.
