Media preparation - 200 mL of media for conditions 1 and 2, 100 mL of media
for conditions 3 and 4.

Note: I thawed reagents like KSR and FBS yesterday and stored them in the
mini-fridge under the bioreactor.

The 100 ng/mL of FGF, IGF1 and PDGF will be added to an aliquot at the start
of each week, which will serve as the media required for the feeds.

 ~~Aliquot 65 mL of each of the above media and add 100 ng/mL of FGF, IGF1 and
PDGF to these aliquots. This media will be used for today and Thursday. Make
sure these are labelled clearly to indicate that growth factors have been
added.~~
