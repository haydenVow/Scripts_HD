### Process:

1\. Aliquotted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then
placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath for a minimum of 20 minutes
prior to use:

  1. TrypLE:    30     mL in    1 x 70 ml     tubes
  2.  dPBS (for neutralising):    30     mL
  3.  dPBS (for washing):     30    mL
  4. Growth media (for resuspension & seeding):     185    mL 

Time that all aliquots were placed in the water bath the warm before use
10:03   am

Note: if aliquots were placed in water bath at different time, record the time
stamp for each individual solution.




4\. Removed vessel(s) from the incubator     10:53   am

5\. Washed the vessel(s) with dPBS (warmed).

6\. Added    10     mL tryple to each vessel/well and incubated at 37˚C.

  1. Start/Finish for TrypLE was     11:13 - 11:21   am 

7\. Neutralised with    10      dPBS and combined cell suspension into 2 x
50 ml   tube.

8\. Centrifuged at 300 x g for 5 min.

  1. Start/Finish time for centrifugation was     11:25 - 11:30 am 




9\. Aspirated the supernatant(s).

10\. Resuspended pellet(s) in    8   mL     growth     media     11:54   am

11\. Aliquoted     10 uL     of resuspended cells into a microcentrifuge tube
for cell count.

12\. Performed a cell count using the haemocytometer and recorded the cell
count data in the Google Doc spreadsheet: Cell Count Spreadsheet or cell count
widget below

  1. Total cell number was:     28 896 000        




13\. Transferred      2.035     ml of cell suspension to the pre-warmed
180     mL Growth media:      12:10 am

16\. Transferred vessel(s) to incubate at:

  * [ ]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (avian cells)
  * [X]  30ºC, 5% CO2 (avian cells)

Version Change Log

NameChange Details  
V1 (original)N/A  
V2Changed all sentences to past tense to better reflect a hand-written lab
book entry.  
Various formatting changes.  
Addition of more detail to step 2, removal of step 3. Replaced volume
requirements table with updated volumes @Sep 22, 2020  
Updated temperature selection for mammalian/aviary cells @Sep 23, 2020  
V3Included a section for 'vessel type' in passage ID table Replace
'flask/plate' with 'vessel' throughout lab book Include at step 1 to take
image of vessel on the microscope  
Mentioned that dPBS for washing should be warm - step 3(2) and 5.  
Added timepoint at step 4 for when vessel is removed from incubator  
Include at step 11 to aliquot cell resuspension into microcentrifuge tube  
Included at step 10 and 13 time point for when cell pellet is resuspended and
when resuspended cells is moved into growth media.  
Included p38i in table of regent used  
Combined two dPBS entries in 'Media/reagents' table Added 'cell density per
vessel'
