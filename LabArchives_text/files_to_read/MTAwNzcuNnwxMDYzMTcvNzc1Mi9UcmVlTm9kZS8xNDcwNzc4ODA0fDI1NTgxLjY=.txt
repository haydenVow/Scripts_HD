### Process:

1\. Took image of one culture to assess confluence (100% confluent)

2\. Aliquotted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then
placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath for a minimum of 20 minutes
prior to use:

  1. TrypLE:     30    mL 
  2.  dPBS (for neutralising):     30    mL
  3.  dPBS (for washing):     ~20    mL
  4. Growth media (for seeding):     3x30    mL across 3xT175s  

3\. Aliquots left at room temp, Flasks placed at 30 degrees, 5% CO2 until
seeding post cell count (see below)




4\. Removed vessel(s) from the incubator  

5\. Washed the vessel(s) with dPBS (warmed).

6\. Added     10    mL tryple to each vessel/well and incubated at 37˚C.

7\. Neutralised with     10mL     dPBS and combined cell suspension into a
50mL    tube.

8\. Centrifuged at 50 x g for 5 min.




9\. Aspirated the supernatant(s).

10\. Resuspended pellet(s) in     20    mL     dPBS     media.

11\. Aliquoted     20uL     of resuspended cells into a microcentrifuge tube
for cell count.

12\. Performed a cell count using the haemocytometer and recorded the cell
count data in the Google Doc spreadsheet: Cell Count Spreadsheet or cell count
widget below

  1. Total cell number was:      9,200,000       




13\. Transferred     2.66      ml of cell suspension to each pre-warmed
T175 flask  

14\. Transferred vessel(s) to incubate at:

  * [x]  30ºC, 5% CO2 (CHOMP cells)
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (avian cells)




Observations/Summary:

There was a large number of trypan positive cells present during cell
counting. The media was also quite acidic and was almost yellow in colour
before passage. It's possible this may have heavily reduced cell viability

Version Change Log

NameChange Details  
V1 (original)N/A  
V2Changed all sentences to past tense to better reflect a hand-written lab
book entry.  
Various formatting changes.  
Addition of more detail to step 2, removal of step 3. Replaced volume
requirements table with updated volumes @Sep 22, 2020  
Updated temperature selection for mammalian/aviary cells @Sep 23, 2020  
V3Included a section for 'vessel type' in passage ID table Replace
'flask/plate' with 'vessel' throughout lab book Include at step 1 to take
image of vessel on the microscope  
Mentioned that dPBS for washing should be warm - step 3(2) and 5.  
Added timepoint at step 4 for when vessel is removed from incubator  
Include at step 11 to aliquot cell resuspension into microcentrifuge tube  
Included at step 10 and 13 time point for when cell pellet is resuspended and
when resuspended cells is moved into growth media.  
Included p38i in table of regent used  
Combined two dPBS entries in 'Media/reagents' table Added 'cell density per
vessel'
