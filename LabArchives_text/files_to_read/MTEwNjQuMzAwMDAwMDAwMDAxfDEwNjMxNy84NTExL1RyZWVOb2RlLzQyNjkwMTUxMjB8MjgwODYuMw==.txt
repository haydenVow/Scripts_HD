Aim / Goal


Viabiility stain with propdium iodide (dead cells) with a Hoechst 33342
counter nuclei stain.


Hypothesis


From brightfield microscopy it is expected that moist of these cells will be
dead.


Protocol


1\. Hoechst conc.: 1ug/mL, PI conc.: 1ug/mL

2\. Do not wash scaffolds.

3\. Stain with both stains for 15 mins at 37C.

4\. Remove excess stain replace with PBS.

5\. Image

Results


High to total cell death was observed in all conditions. In no ePL conditions,
less cell death seemed evident.

Take home messages:

\- ePL is not required and may actually hamper cell growth.

\- Daily feeds will be required for high cell density or alternatively culture
scaffolds in higher volume vessels.

\- A method for transferring scaffolds will need to be developed.
