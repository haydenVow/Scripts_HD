Counting & sampling process
  
  
  1. Retrieved a random selection of 10 x E125s from the incubator and transferred to BSC
  2. Transferred 510 uL samples from each flask into ViCell counting cups
  3. Put aside any cups with samples from flasks #13-20 for glucose testing
  4. Loaded all other samples into ViCell carousel for counting
  5. Repeated steps 1-4 twice more with remaining flasks in a batch of 10, then 8
  6. Tested glucose levels in samples from flasks #13-20:
    1. Dipped 1 x Diastix test strip into each sample (8 strips total)
    2. Read result 30 seconds after dipping and recorded corresponding glucose level in table lower in lab book (see colour charts attached to lab books and on Diastix packet to interpret colour)
    3. Took image of test strips lined up on laminated paper and attached to lab book for later reference
    4. Replaced flasks that recorded 5 g/L or higher back in incubator 
    5. For flasks that recorded 2.5-5 g/L or lower, followed procedure in "feeding process" outlined below


Feeding process

  1. For flasks 13-16 recording 2.5 - 5 g/L or less:
    1. Added 150 uL (2 g/L) glucose stock solution per flask
    2. For ala-gln, the volume added will depend on how many days have passed since the last feed or top-up. 
      1. If 1 day has passed, add 150 uL per flask (1 mM)
      2. If 2 days have passed, add 300 uL per flask (2 mM) 
      3. If 3 days have passed, add 450 uL per flask (3 mM)
      4. Etc.
  2. For flasks 17-20 recording 2.5 - 5 g/L or less:
    1. Added 300 uL (4 g/L) glucose stock solution per flask 
    2. For ala-gln, the volume added will depend on how many days have passed since the last feed or top-up. 
      1. If 1 day has passed, add 150 uL per flask (1 mM)
      2. If 2 days have passed, add 300 uL per flask (2 mM) 
      3. If 3 days have passed, add 450 uL per flask (3 mM)
      4. Etc. 
  3. Recorded which flasks were fed in table below

13FS45-10As a single person, it was hard to dip the glucose strip into all
vicell counting cups at the same time and then take the glucose reading
exactly after 30 seconds.
