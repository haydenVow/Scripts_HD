### Process:

  

1\. Fillled three 96 well plates with 300uL of dPBS and 200uL of tryple as per
the plate guide above. Filled another separate plate with growth media
(DMEM/F12+ 20% FBS + 1xP/S), 200uL per well.  

2\. Generated a multiwell open protocol using the 'Dynamo' script using the 1
well passaging protocol attached and the pick lists generated on the 6/5/22
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1yQD_JrhzktpQd0vaCt2B5OskKgl9SipLLab3WZ9v7ZU/edit#gid=1517361241

3\. Set up the opentron deck as per the layout at the top of the page using
cultures 12153 and ran the generated multiwell protocol (see attached).

6\. Allowed the protocol to run to completion.

7\. Transferred the new culture to incubate at 30 degrees, 5% CO2 incubator
#140.

  




Observations/Summary:

Some things did not go well during the passage:

\- The opentron would pick up some tips but not others hence, some wells were
not passaged or were left dry

\- The opentron did not dispense cells into every well it was meant to

So, after running the protocol, I looked at the wells on the destination plate
under the microscope and passaged (on 1 June) those that hadn't been passaged
manually. I used 200uL of dPBS to was the wells, 50uL of tryple and then
transferred 20uL of the tryplised cells into the respective well (containing
growth media) on the destination plate. This included:

\- Well G6 on the origin plate was passaged into well H4 on the destination
plate

\- Well C7 into well C5 on the destination plate

\- Well D7 into well D5 on the destination plate

\- Well C8 into well G5 on the destination plate

\- Well F6 into well H5 on the destination plate
