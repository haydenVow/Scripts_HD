RELATED TO MILESTONE:  PPP Q3 KR3 Achieve a biomass doubling time of less than
24h and final biomass of 10g in a 2L bioreactor in ACF

AIM/PURPOSE: To design, fabricate and test microfluidic devices for the
continuous separation of different sized particles in culture broth. This is
an essential technology for both perfusion and harvesting of our fibroblast
cells.

HYPOTHESIS: That microfluidic devices can be made to exploit differential
inertia of particles in a mixture, and thereby separate particles of different
size and/or density.

RESULTS SUMMARY: This should only be completed if the data can be visualised
with a single graph/image, otherwise simply state "See Report".

CONCLUSIONS: What were the overall findings? This should be a concise summary
and not duplicate the information in the results/report. For example "We found
that Bovine MuSCs could only achieve a cell density 50% of that observed with
planar culture without undergoing precocious differentiation. These results
mean that we are currently limited to X cells/ml in suspension culture until
we find a way to inhibit precocious differentiation"

NEXT STEPS: This should be a dot point list of any immediate outcomes, changes
to SOPs, as well as providing a direct link to any new experiments arising
from these findings. Importantly, this section should also include any
potential DEPLOYMENTS to the production team
