Process

  1. Placed 9 mL of growth media in the water bath at 37C 11:20  
  

  2. Culture vessels removed from the incubator 11:00 (for imaging) 11:45 (for feed)  
  

  3. Each vessel was examined under the microscope and imaged at 10x and 20x magnifications. Observations were recorded in the table bellow 
  4. Culture 9413 (WALLE08) was terminated today as only a few cells were observed attached to the vessel.  
  

  5. Removed 50% of the media from each well.    
  
  

  6. Replaced with 1.5 mL of pre-warmed growth media.  
  

  7. Culture vessels returned to library lab incubator 77, 37C and 5% CO2  11:30 (for imaging) 11:50 (for feed)

Observations  
  
9411-WALLE06-Bennets Wallaby P0-1of1  
https://mia-capture.vow.tools/#/session/rec0Zaj3lV03FZipR/images  
Fewer cells than the other vastus lateralis culture (WALLE07) however there
are a couple of clusters that are 90-100% confluent.  
  
9412-WALLE07-Bennets Wallaby P0-1of1  
https://mia-capture.vow.tools/#/session/recD9g25kDiyPOeF9/images  
Significant increase in adherent cell numbers compared to at the last
observation. Several areas of the well are 70-95% confluent while other areas
are sparely populated.  
  
9413-WALLE08-Bennets Wallaby P0-1of1  
https://mia-capture.vow.tools/#/session/recCVxmehAA2KsI1B/images  
Only a few scattered cells were observed attached the the wells. Culture
terminated today.  
  
9414-WALLE09-Bennets Wallaby P0-1of1  
https://mia-capture.vow.tools/#/session/recnbCZST2qwcGbsP/images  
A couple of areas where confluence is approx 70%.
