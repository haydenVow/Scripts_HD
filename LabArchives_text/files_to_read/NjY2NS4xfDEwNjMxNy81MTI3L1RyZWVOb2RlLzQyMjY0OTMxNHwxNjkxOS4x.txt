RELATED TO MILESTONE: Non-KR

AIM/PURPOSE: The overarching aim of this study is to assess variations in
doubling times between F_CHOMP07/09 cell lines and between their MCBs versus
WCBs. In addition we will take the opportunity to look at the effects of
different culture media compositions on F_CHOMP cell doubling times.

HYPOTHESIS: .  
1\. There will be no significant difference between the average cell doubling
times of F_CHOMP07 and F_ CHOMP09 MCBs  
2\. There will be no significant difference between the average cell doubling
times of F_ CHOMP07 and F_ CHOMP09 WCBs  
3\. There will be no significant difference between the average cell doubling
times of F_ CHOMP07 and F_ CHOMP09 MCBs compared to their respective WCBs  
4\. There will be no significant difference between the average cell doubling
times of F_ CHOMP09 WCB cells cultured in ACF media containing fresh 100ng
each of FGF, IGF1, PDGF + 0.1% chemically defined lipid concentrate.  compared
to those cultured in media containing a thawed 'bullet' of the same growth
factors.  
5\. There will be no significant difference between the average cell doubling
times of F_ CHOMP09 WCBs when cultured in DMEM/F12 + 20% FBS compared to 20%
KSR without growth factors.  
6\. There will be no significant difference between the average cell doubling
times of F_ CHOMP09 WCB cells in ACF media containing 100ng each of FGF, IGF1,
PDGF + 0.1% chemically defined lipid concentrate, compared to those containing
no growth factors (KSR only).  
7\. There will be no significant difference between the average cell doubling
times of F_ CHOMP09 WCBs when cultured in DMEM/F12 + 20%  FBS compared to
Fibrolife base media supplemented with 100ng each of FGF, IGF1, PDGF + 0.1%
chemically defined lipid concentrate.

RESULTS SUMMARY:  
During fixation and dapi staining, cells became detached from the plates. This
meant we were unable to obtain accurate cell count data from stained images.
Instead, phase images taken prior to fixation were compared by eye after the
conclusion of the experiment. Phase contrast images were only captured for a
single well of each condition, on each day, therefore any conclusions drawn
from this study will need to interpreted with caution. This study will need to
be replicated, and quantitative data obtained before these results can be
verified. As the phase images taken on day 6 and 7 of this study were over-
exposed, or taken at low magnification, day 5 images were used to make visual
comparisons between conditions.

1\. There was no visible difference in confluence between F_CHOMP07 and F_
CHOMP09 MCBs.  
2\. F_CHOMP07 WCB had lower confluence than F_ CHOMP09 WCB.  
3\. There was no visible difference in confluence between F_ CHOMP09 MCB and
WCBs however CHOMP07 WCB showed lower confluence than it's MCB.  
4\. It was not possible to compare F_ CHOMP09 WCB cells cultured in fresh
growth factors compared to a thawed 'bullet' because cells did not survive in
either condition.  
5\. F_ CHOMP09 WCB cells did not survive in DMEM/F12 + 20% KSR.  
6\. It was not possible to compare growth rates of F_ CHOMP09 WCB cells in ACF
media containing growth factors, compared to those containing no growth
factors (KSR only), as cells did not survive in either condition.  
7\. Very few cells survived and attached to the culture vessel in Fibrolife
media.

CONCLUSIONS:  
This study will need to be replicated, and quantitative data obtained before
any concrete conclusions can be made. It does appear likely however that 20%
FBS supplementation supports a greater rate of proliferation in both of our
CHOMP cell lines than supplementation with 10% FBS. It is also apparent that
CHOMP cells do not thrive in our current ACF media formulation, or in
Fibrolife base media supplemented with growth factors.

NEXT STEPS:  
Due to the loss of cells during the fixation and dapi staining of plates, it
was not possible to obtain accurate cell count data from this study. The assay
should be repeated in order to acquire quantitative results from which we can
determine the statistical significance of findings. Staining with Hoechst
instead of Dapi, which does not require fixation, may allow us to mitigate the
risk of cell loss. Alternatively, Vowsers have reported less cell loss by
performing the entire fixing and dapi staining protocol on the Opentrons,
rather than by fixing by hand.
