Perform Passage/Feed

  

  1. Prepared media as per media calculator 60mL
  2. added   12 uL  EGF and  60  uL IGF to media in specimen jar
  3. Incubated in water bath. Incubated from 10:30-11:45   

  4. Filter-sterilised media using syringe and filter unit directly into E-flask. 30mL per E250 flask
  5. Used serelogical pipette to carefully transfer cells from ULA plate into flask. 1 plate into 1 flask (30mL from plate into 30mL new media in flask)  

  6. Returned flask to incubation with shaking agitation

Observations:

  * some aggregation of cells in ULA plates before transfer (see attached image)
  * gently disrupted aggregates with trituration before moving to new vessel
