Growth Media:

  * [ ]  DMEM/F12 + 20% FBS + 1X P/S + P38i (10uM)

Total media required: 7mL

Total p38i required: 3.5uL

  




Process:

1\. (11-6-2021, 13:30 )Aliquotted   7mL  mL of  Growth Media into  1x15mL
tube(s). Placed the tube at 4 degrees

* * *

  

2\. Removed aliquot from the fridge and added 3.5uL of P38 inhibitor to the
aliquot.

3\. Placed in water bath  9:35 am

4\. Removed   50 % of supernatant from each well (1.5mL). A separate tip was
used between each well to avoid contamination between clones.

5\. Replaced with  1.5 mL (per well/per vessel) of   growth  media.

6\. Returned vessel to incubate at: 10:22 am

  * [x]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (aviary cells)

  

  * Incubator #78
