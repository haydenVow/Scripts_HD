Process

  1. Collected E125s from shaker, wiped with ethanol-sprayed Rediwipe, and brought into BSC
  2. Using a 25 mL serelogical pipette, gently pipette-mixed culture to break up cell clumps
  3. Transfer suspension into 50 mL tubes. Kept E125 vessels in BSC, as culture will be returned to these vessels after feed. 
  4. Centrifuged 50 mL tubes at 300 x g for 5 min

Spin 1: 10:31-10:36

Spin 2: 10:37-10:42

  1. Aspirated 75% (15 mL) of supernatant, taking extra care to not disrupt or aspirate pellet 
  2. Added 15 mL of fresh, warmed growth media to each 50 mL tube
  3. Took 100 uL samples from each culture and transferred to separate wells in a 96-WP, recording the location of each sample for future plate mapping 
  4. Gently pipette-mixed cultures using serological, before moving cell suspension back to E125s
  5. Returned E125s to incubator

Staining

Prepare reagents

Prepared dead stain solution in amber/black centrifuge tube:  
\- 2 mL dPBS  
\- 2 drops Nucgreen AF488 dead stain  
Vortex for 5 seconds to mix

Prepared Hoechst stain (50 ug/mL) solution in amber/black centrifuge tube:  
\- 9500 uL MilliQ  
\- 500 uL Hoechst Trihydrochloride trihydrate (1mg/mL)  
Vortex for 5 seconds to mix. Solution can be stored at 4°C for up to 6 months

Stain plates

  1. Added 80 uL of dead stain solution (dPBS+Sytox) to cells
  2. Stained samples with 20 uL of Hoechst stain solution
  3. Incubated for 30 minutes in the dark at room temperature 11:46 - 12:16
  4. Added 100 uL dPBS into plate columns 3, 4, 9 and 10 using a multichannel pipette
  5. Serially diluted cell suspension by transferring 100 uL cell suspension to subsequent wells, down to 25% dilution  

  6. Centrifuged plates at 300 RCF for 1 minute 12:17
  7. Prepared plate maps

## Imaging

  1. Configure the Zaber session to image the entirety of each well; for 96 well plates this requires a 3 x 3 stitched image
  2. Take images of each well on the blue fluroescence ("DAPI") and green fluorescence ("AF488") channels




## Analysis

  1. Analyzed the blue- and green-channel images using the DAPI and AF488 MIA macros respectively.
  2. Downloaded and extracted the data then pasted it into the "MIA output" data workbook created in the "Staining" section.
  3. Copied the data from the "Final output" sheet of the "MIA output" data workbook to the "Master Cell Counting Sheet" of the "Suspension culture counting spreadsheet": https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1YuTvXJXQQMIMwRZGeqNjdi20WeURg5FpM-1TJ-zrb1c/edit?usp=sharing
