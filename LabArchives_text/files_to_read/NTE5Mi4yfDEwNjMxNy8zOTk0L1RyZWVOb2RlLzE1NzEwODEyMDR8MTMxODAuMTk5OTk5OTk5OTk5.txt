RELATED TO MILESTONE: Generate 3 production ready cell lines. KR2: Generate
>1500 clones per month starting September 1st

AIM/PURPOSE: To test how many times Hoechst can be used in the cloning
pipeline to quantify cells. i.e. To test whether Hoechst staining cells
multiple times affects viability

HYPOTHESIS: Hoechst staining cells 3 times and then passaging them will not
affect cell viability/cell numbers compared to unstained control.

RESULTS SUMMARY:

Cells stained with Hoechst ReadyFlow reagent were observed to be fluorescing
more brightly than cells stained with Hoechst ReadyProbes reagent. Cell death
was observed in wells that did not receive a 100% feed after staining with
Hoechst ReadyFlow.

Cell clumping was observed after the second passage, most likely because cells
became over confluent. Accurate cell counts cannot be obtained from images of
clumped cells so the experiment was terminated.

CONCLUSIONS:

The aim was not achieved and the hypothesis could not be investigated
sufficiently.

NEXT STEPS:

  * This experiment should be repeated with the following changes:
    * Some wells from the unstained control should be 'sacrificed' (i.e. stained) after each passage to obtain cell counts for the control.
    * Cells should be passaged into larger and larger vessels each time to prevent them from becoming overconfluent and clumping.
    * When cells are expanded to 24 wp, passage them manually to 6wp whilst the OT2 protocol is being optimised.
  * Optimise the passaging protocol for 24 wp to 6 wp so that a large number of cells are not left behind
