Prepare materials for thaw and seed:

1\. Gelatin coated  4  x   T175 flasks with sterile filtered 0.1% gelatin
solution and then incubated all coated flasks at 37ºC

  * Time when all flasks placed into the incubator 16  :27 - 17:27   

2\. Aliquotted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then
placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath for a minimum of 20 minutes
prior to use:

  *  Growth media (for seeding):   
PRF DMEM/F12 + 20% FBS + 10 mM HEPES + 1x P/S    30 mL  
L-15 + 20% FBS  \+ 1x P/S   30  mL  
DMEM/F12 + 20% FBS + 1x P/S   60 mL  
  * Added p38i (15 uL to 30mL aliquots, 30 uL to 60 mL aliquot)
  * Time that aliquot was placed in the water bath to warm before use:   18: 00 

  




## Thaw and seed vial:

3\. Collected the cryovial from Liquid Nitrogen storage & place in foam
floater in water bath for 5 min  18:29-18:34  

Location where cryovial was collected from:

Vial details:  1   x  C2C12  cryovials at   1M  cells each for a total of   1M
cells

Brew

Tower/Bucket # 3

Box/Cane # 3

Vial location: I7

Vial ID(s):

13104-FrzCul-C2C12-Vial-79of81

  

`4. Ethanol sprayed & transferred the vial(s) to the BSC.`

`5.  Added  500 µL of Growth Media (to generate a total volume of 1mL in the
cryovial) to the cryovial, resuspended the cell suspension gently to reduce
osmotic shock. `

`6. Collected the entire 375 uLmL of cell suspension & transfer into the pre-
warmed 90 mL tube of Growth Media, and 125 uL to 30 mL tube of growth media  
`

`7. Using a 10mL serological pipette, resuspended & distributed the cells
evenly in the   90 mL of pre-warmed Growth Media (prepared in Step 2). `

`8. Transfered  30 mL to each pre-coated  T175  flask/well, allow to rest in
the BSC at RT for 30 min  18:45- 19:15 `

`9. Transferred flask/plate(s) to incubate at: 19:18`

  * [X ]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * [X ]  37ºC, CO2 Free (mammalian cells)

  

Making labels

Note - You will need to increase the passage number by one. (i.e. if your
thawed vial ID has a passage number of 3, when you make a culture ID for you
vessel you will need change the passage number to 4 on Airtable.)
