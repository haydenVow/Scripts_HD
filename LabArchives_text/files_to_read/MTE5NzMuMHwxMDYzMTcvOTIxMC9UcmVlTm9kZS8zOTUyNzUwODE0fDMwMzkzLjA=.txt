Aim/Purpose


To test a range of media ingredient categories based on HyCell recipe with our
current best media to increase cell density


Hypothesis


That one or more ingredient categories will result in an increased cell
density in our growth medium


Technical Gap


We have trialled making up in-house media from scratch to replicate HyCell,
however the experiment failed and the units we were basing it off were found
later to be incorrect. This has yet to be re-attempted, and would require a
lot of time and iterations. We believe that by supplementing our current
medium with ingredients to make it "look more" like HyCell, we may be able to
achieve a higher cell density with less time and effort than if we started
from scratch.

Day -1Thursday 18-August

  1. Make up 1.8 L of sterile 50/50 RPMI/CHO medium with growth factors ("base medium")
  2. Make up stock solutions of each factor in 50/50 RPMI/CHO growth medium and filter sterilise
  3. Make up 18 x media conditions (100 mL per condition) in 18 x 120 mL sample pots 
  4. Transfer media conditions to 54 x E125s (3 flasks per condition, 30 mL per flask) 
  5. Transfer 30 mL of base medium to 3 x E125 (control flasks)
  6. Parafilm lids and place flasks in fridge at 4'C overnight

  * Addy, Lily & Vic will prepare stock solutions of factors and base medium
  * Lily & Vic will prepare media conditions  
  
Question for reviewer: do we want to use best MFG medium or best R&D medium?

[VP] Let's use the R&D version as our 'base' for testing. The additives
(Thymidine and Hypoxanthine) are not expensive and may have beneficial
interactions with components we're testing (e.g. albumin as a carrier protein)

sssss{Day 0 Friday 19-August

  1. Remove parafilm from flask lids and place in incubator at 37'C to warm & equilibrate
  2. Count 50/50 RPMI/CHO continuous culture flask
  3. Transfer 350M cells (8M extra for buffer) to 250 mL falcon tubes
  4. Centrifuge (500 x g, 5 min)
  5. Re-suspend in 58 mL x base medium (6M cells/mL) 
  6. Transfer 57 x E-125s with equilibrated media from incubator to 2 x BSCs, 10 at a time 
  7. Using a P1000, add 1 mL of cell suspension to each flask (6M cells per flask)
  8. Return flasks to incubate (37'C, 5% CO2, 120 RPM)

  * Lily and/or Addy and/or Vic will seed flasks (2-3 scientists)
  * Each scientist will take 10 flasks at a time into separate BSCs to minimise contamination risk

  *   

  
  
Day 1Saturday 20-August

  1. No counts (see "note for reviewer) 

Note for reviewer: I suggest skipping counts on days 1 & 2 to avoid weekend
work. Given our metric is maximum density, these data points are not crucial
and counting 57 flasks will take a significant amount of time even with the
Cellaca (specifically the time taken for sampling)  

[VP] I agree with skipping these earlier data points and use of Cellaca
