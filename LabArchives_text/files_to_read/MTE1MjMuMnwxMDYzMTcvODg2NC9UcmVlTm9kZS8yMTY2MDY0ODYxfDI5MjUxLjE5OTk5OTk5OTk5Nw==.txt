Note

Isolate thawed on 06/07/22 has not adhered to vessels and has apparently not
survived the freeze/thaw process. For this reason, cell banks will be used
instead of isolate.

Prepare materials for thaw and seed:

  * Growth media: Prefilled a urine jar with either 30mL or 60mL of respective medias and allowed to warm to room temperature (not 37C to reduce temp shock), 30min prior to use.




## Thaw and seed

  1. Collected the cryovials from Liquid Nitrogen storage (as per table above) & placed in the water bath for 1-2 min, then placed in the BSC for a further 3 min to thaw (slow thaw to reduce shock and aid cell viability)
  2. `Ethanol sprayed & transferred the vial(s) to the BSC.`
  3. `Added  500ul of Growth Media (to generate a total volume of 1.5mL in the cryovial) to the cryovial, re suspended the cell suspension gently to reduce osmotic shock. `
  4. `Collected the entire cell suspension & transfer into urine jars containing pre-warmed media (KSR media for SILKIE, OPTIPRO for all others)`
  5. `Centrifuge for 5min at 500g`
  6. `Removed 9mL supernatant and re-suspended cells in the remaining 1mL`
  7. `Transferred cells into flasks (30mL/flask)`
  8. `Transferred flask/plate(s) to incubate at ```37ÂºC, 5% CO2, Incubator #77 Library lab.
