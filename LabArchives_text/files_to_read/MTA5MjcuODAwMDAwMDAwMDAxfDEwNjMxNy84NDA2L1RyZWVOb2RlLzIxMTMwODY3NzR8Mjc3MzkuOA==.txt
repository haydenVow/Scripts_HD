  1. Took 1 x 560 uL samples from each of the 4 x E-125 (1 x technical reps/flask).
  2. Performed counts using Vicell (560 uL/sample):

  3. Once the counts have been performed, transferred the cell suspension of each E-125 into a separate 50 ml tube (make sure the counts have been performed before doing the next steps as in some cases the Vicell accidentally discards the sample without performing a count). 
  4. Centrifuged the tubes @ 500 xg for 5 minutes.
  5. Removed the supernatant and dispensed into a new, labelled 50 mL tube (include flask ID, condition and harvested day and date).
  6. Placed the 4 x 50mL tubes in the -80 freezer in main lab.
