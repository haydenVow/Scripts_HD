Discussed the direction of this passage with Tom and Shaleen the previous day.
The harvest today will follow the following adjustments to the protocol.

  * For 1 flask in each of the 2xE125 flask set 
    * Trypsin-EDTA containing poloxomer 188 (1% w/v) will be used for the harvest. 
    * Growth media containing 1% w/v poloxomer 188 will be used to neutralise the trypsin. 
    * dPBS containing poloxomer 188 (10% w/v) will be used to wash carriers after neutralised cells are collected. 
    * dPBS washes and neutralised cells in trypsin will be kept in separate tube to compare recovery.  
  * 1 flask in each of the 2xE125 flask set will be harvested as per regular protocol below
    * No poloxomer during typsin incubation
    * No poloxomer in dPBS washes
    * no poloxomer in neutralising media. 




Made up 60mL of growth media containing 1% poloxomer in the main lab,
transferred the contents to the library lab.

Aliquoted 67mL of 10% w/v Poloxomer 188 in the main lab and transferred to the
library lab.




Equilibrate microcarriers in culture medium before use

  1. Prior to use, aliquotted two lots of | 28.125 | mL of sterilized microcarriers ( 20 g/L stock) suspended in dPBS into |  2 |  x | E500  | flasks.
  2. Rinsed microcarriers in | 30 | mL culture medium (50 mL/g Cytodex). (this rinse reduces dilution of the culture medium by PBS trapped between and within the microcarriers, which is particularly important when using small culture volumes or cells with low plating efficiencies).
  3. The microcarriers were then allowed to settle and as much supernatant as possible was removed.
  4. The microcarriers were resuspended to the desired volume of culture medium ( | 120 | mL ) in each vessel.
  5. The culture vessel was transferred to the incubator for at least 1 hour or overnight so that the microcarriers and culture medium could equilibrate. |   13:58   am/pm |

## First wash to remove serum:

  1. Allow the microcarriers to settle for at least 2 minutes [14:08]
  2. Gently tilt the flask to an angle of approximately 30 degrees from vertical
  3. Remove the cap and aspirate the supernatant using a serological pipet - keep the tip only 5-10 mm below the surface during this procedure
  4. Transfer half of the fresh, pre-warmed dPBS (15mL) for prewashing to the flask using a serological pipet - wash down the insides to wash any stuck microcarriers back into the bulk suspension, then replace the cap

  




## Second wash to remove serum:

  1. Allow the microcarriers to settle for at least 2 minutes
  2. Gently tilt the flask to an angle of approximately 30 degrees from vertical
  3. Remove the cap and aspirate the supernatant using a serological pipet - keep the tip only 5-10 mm below the surface during this procedure
  4. Transfer the remaining half of the fresh, pre-warmed dPBS for prewashing to the flask using a serological pipet - wash down the insides to wash any stuck microcarriers back into the bulk suspension, then replace the cap

  




## Add detachment agent:

  1. Allow the microcarriers to settle for at least 2 minutes
  2. Gently tilt the flask to an angle of approximately 30 degrees from vertical
  3. Remove the cap and aspirate the supernatant using a serological pipet - keep the tip only 5-10 mm below the surface during this procedure
  4. Combined all Trypsin-EDTA aliquots into one 120mL container. 
  5. Transfer the fresh, pre-warmed Trypsin/EDTA solution to the flask using a serological pipet - wash down the insides to wash any stuck microcarriers back into the bulk suspension, then replace the cap.
    1. Nathan: 30mL of trypsin EDTA was added to flask [ ] 27mL of Trypsin-EDTA was added to flask 6657 along with 3mL of 10% w/v Poloxomer 188 (final conc ~1% w/v).
    2. Shaleen: 30mL of trypsin EDTA was added to flask [ ] 27mL of Trypsin-EDTA was added to flask 6660 along with 3mL of 10% w/v Poloxomer 188 (final conc ~1% w/v).

  




## Incubate flask:

  1. Stop the shaker
  2. Remove the flask from the BSC and transfer it back to the shaker
  3. Restart the shaker at the `speed 155rpm` \- see the table below. [Nathan: 14:49]
  4. After `7 `minutes, stop the shaker
  5. Remove the flask from the shaker [Shaleen 14:57]
  6. Cells were sampled (100uL) at the 10 minute mark for Nathan and Shaleen, observed some free floating cells as a result of detachment under 4X objective (Primo) however a significant amount of cells appeared to be still attached. Hence, it was decided to leave cells in shaker for an additional 5 mins.
  7. At 15:04, flasks were sampled once again to observed detachment, cells still appeared to be attached and not free floating single cells as desired. Hence, cells were placed back in the incubator for another 5 mins.
  8. At 15:16, flasks were sampled once again to observed detachment, cells still appeared to be attached and not free floating single cells as desired. Hence, cells were placed back in the incubator for another 5 mins.
  9. All four flasks were removed from shaker at 15:22
  10. Wipe down the flask with an ethanol-soaked wipe and place it in the BSC

Observations/Summary:

Trypsin aliquots appeared to have different colours, some were very yellow
while others were very pink. Decided to combine the aliquots into one 120mL
container and distribute the trypsin to each flask from there just so each
flask didn't experience different Trypsin conditions.
