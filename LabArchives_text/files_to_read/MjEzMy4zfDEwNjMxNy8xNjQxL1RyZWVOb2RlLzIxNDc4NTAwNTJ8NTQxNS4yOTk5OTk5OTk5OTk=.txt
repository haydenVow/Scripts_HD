Growth Media:

  * [X]  DMEM + 10% FBS + 1X P/S 

Prepare materials for thaw and seed:  

1\. Gelatin coated  6  x   T175  with sterile filtered 0.1% gelatin solution
and then incubated at 37ºC for at least 1 hour

  * Time when all flasks placed into the incubator   9:50  

2\. Aliquoted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then
placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath for a minimum of 20 minutes
prior to use:

  * Growth media (seeding):    180 mL in  1 x 250 mL  pot
    * Time that aliquot was placed in the water bath to warm before use:   10:25  

  




## Thaw and seed vial:

3\. Collected the 2 x cryovials from Liquid Nitrogen storage & place in foam
floater in water bath for 5 min  10:48 - 10:53

Location where cryovials were collected from:

Vial details: 2 x C2C12 cryovials at 500 K cells each for a total of 1M cells

Brew

Tower/Bucket # 1

Box/Cane # 6

Vial location: A1, A2

Vial ID(s): 2861-Culture-6905-Vial-1of54, 2862-Culture-6905-Vial-2of54

4\. Ethanol sprayed & transferred the vial(s) to the BSC.

5\.  Added  mL of Growth Media (to generate a total volume of 1mL in the
cryovial) to each cryovial, resuspended the cell suspension gently to reduce
osmotic shock.

6\. Collected the entire 1 mL of cell suspension & transfer into the pre-
warmed tube of Growth Media.

7\. Using a 50 mL serological pipette, resuspended & distributed the cells
evenly

8\. Added 300 mL of cell suspension to gelatin-coated 2CF

9\. Left to rest in BSC for 30 minutes. Timestamp: 11:00 - 11:30

10\. Transfered flask/plate(s) to incubate at:

  * [x ]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
