## Steps for cell density experiment

ID of culture used: 12504  
Performed by Jesi D

1\. 136mL aliquot was taken into 1 x 250mL sterile pot.

2\. Growth factors were added to the growth media aliquot.

  1.  136uL of IGF-LR3 (mesokine) added
  2.  27uL of rEGF (mesokine) added  
Note: Calculate the amount of growth factor needed for the volume of aliquoted
growth medium by using the E8 Calculator.

  3. Aliquot placed in water bath 17 : 02 pm
  4. Centrifuge 5min 500g: 17.22 - 17:27

  

## Steps for cell expansion experiment

ID of culture used: 12505  
Performed by Zoe M

  1. 191mL aliquot of Growth medium was taken into 1 x 250mL sterile pot. 
  2. Growth factors were added to the growth media aliquot.
    1.  250uL of IGF-LR3 (mesokine) added
    2.  50uL of rEGF (mesokine) added  
Note: Calculate the amount of growth factor needed for the volume of aliquoted
growth medium by using the E8 Calculator.

  3. Aliquot placed in water bath 17 : 02 pm  

  4. Add 59mL of cell suspension into the 191mL of pre-warmed growth medium (total=250mL).
  5. Aliqout 125mL of the cell suspension into 2 x E500 flask.
  6. Centrifuge the remaining cell suspension at 500g for 5min 17:45-17:50
  7. Harvest and weigh the remaining cell pellet
    1. mass of harvest: 1.6953g
  8. Place in a -20C freezer 18:30
