Media made:

  * E810C
  * E810C + extra ethanolamine + extra p38i
  * E810C w/o GABA
  * E810C w/o GABA, EGF, LIF, + extra ethanolamine, p38i, IL-6, IGF-LR3

Volume of media being made:    ~40mL each




## Process

  1. Prepared 0.2M solution of GABA by adding 0.103 g in 5 mL PBS.
  2. Prepared 100mM glyoxylic acid solution by adding 0.092g in 10mL DMEM/F12.
  3. Prepared 1M hypoxanthine solution by adding 0.272g in 2mL of DMEM/F12.
  4. Made 280 mL of E8 (0.2xP/S) medium (do not filter yet) using E8 media calculator
  5. Opened E8_9C Media Calculator spreadsheet
  6. Prepared 1:100 dilution of ethanolamine
  7. Added ACF ingredients to E8 to make 280mL of E8_10C without GABA, EGF, and LIF.
    1. E810C includes: 50uM Glyoxylic acid: used  140 uL of 100mM stock
    2. E810C includes: 2mM hypoxanthine: used 560uL of 1M stock
  8. Aliquoted 140 mL of E8_10C without GABA, EGF, and LIF and added the following to make standard E810C
    1. 40uM GABA: 8uL of 0.2M stock
    2. 25nM EGF and 20ng/mL LIF as indicated in the spreadsheet
  9. Aliquoted 40 mL of E8_10C without GABA, EGF, and LIF and added the following to make E810C without GABA:
    1. 25nM EGF and 20ng/mL LIF as indicated in the spreadsheet
  10. Aliquoted 40mL of E8_10C without GABA, EGF, and LIF and added the following to make E810C + extra ethanolamine + extra p38i:
    1. 40uM GABA: 8uL of 0.2M stock
    2. 25nM EGF and 20ng/mL LIF as indicated in the spreadsheet
    3. extra ethanolamine: 14 uL of 1:100 dilution of ethanolamine
    4. extra p38i: 2 uL of 20mM stock
  11. Aliquoted 40mL of E8_10C without GABA, EGF, and LIF and added the following to make E810C w/o GABA, EGF, LIF, + extra ethanolamine, p38i, IL-6, IGF-LR3:
    1. extra ethanolamine: 14 uL of 1:100 dilution of ethanolamine
    2. extra p38i: 2 uL of 20mM stock
    3. IL-6: 2 uL of diluted stock (diluted 1:1000 in PBS)
    4. 2x IGF-LR3: 8 uL of diluted stock (diluted 1:1000 in PBS)
  12. Sterile filtered medium 
  13. Added 400uL of concentrated lipid solution to each 40mL solution of media. 
  14. Wrapped bottle with foil to protect from light  
  15. Labelled and stored in fridge
