Growth Media:

  * [x]  DMEM/F12 + 20% FBS + 1X P/S




### Process:  

For Passage: Heat the following to 30C in the water bath

  1. TrypLE:     500  mL in      1   bottle
  2.  dPBS (for neutralising+ washing):   1Lin 2 x bottles  

  3. DMEM + 20% FBS + 1 x PS for pellet resuspension + Seeding):    3L  

Time that all aliquots were placed in the water bath the warmed to 30C before
use  08:32

Note: if aliquots were placed in water bath at different time, record the time
stamp for each individual solution.




Passage  

  1. Removed vessel(s) from the incubator   08:52   

  2. Washed the vessel(s) with dPBS (warmed).
  3. Added 10ml  tryple to vessel/well and incubated at 30ËšC.
  4. Start/Finish for TrypLE was     09:58-09:11 (13min)  

  5. Neutralised each with with   dPBS (equal to volume of tryple) and transferred to  4x 250mL    tube.
  6. Centrifuged at 650 x g for 5 min.
  7. Start/Finish time for centrifugation was   9:21-9:26  

  8. Aspirated the supernatant and combined pellets(s).
  9. Resuspended pellet(s) in   100 mL   growth   media
  10.  Aliquoted   80uL  of resuspended cells into a microcentrifuge tube for cell count.
  11. Performed a cell count using the haemocytometer and recorded the cell count data in the Google Doc spreadsheet called 'Cell Count Spreadsheet' (see link below):

SSIBtIylyrBQE5kRX5Z8NtI/edit#gid=0  

    1. Total cell count was : 280,400,00
    2. Transferred 16.5m into 6x 500mL bottles of pre-warmed growth media. 
    3. Re-seeded cells into 6x 10CF giving a seeding density of 7394/cm
    4.  Incubate at 30C and 5% CO2. 10:30

    5. NOTE: I did not anticipate harvesting so many cells and therefore did not have enough media prepped. Cells were seeded in 500mL per 10CF after which fresh media was made, warmed to 30C, and an additional 1L of media added to each flask 12:45-13:00
