  5. It was noted that there was a delay with the Vicell (requiring reagent pack change and restart) which meant samples were sitting for ~1 hour which may have decreased cell count. Therefore an average of the measurements taken in the morning and afternoon was used:

## Flask 12589 - Harvested

  1. The remaining cells in flask 12589 were harvested for 2nd product experiments 

## Flask 12588 - Passaged to 12650

  1. 600mL of 50/50 hycell/rpmi media was aliquoted from 12801
  2. 0.600mL of IGF and 0.120 mL of EGF were added to the 600mL of media
  3. Media including growth factors was warmed in a bath from 15:40 to 16:09 at 37 degrees Celcius
  4. Contents of flask 12588 was aliquoted into 3 50mL falcon tubes (~44 mL into each tube)
  5. Falcon tubes were centrifuged at 500g for 5 minutes
  6. Supernatant was removed from each falcon tube
  7. Media was removed from bath and 30mL aliquoted into each falcon tube
  8. The pellets in each falcon tube were resuspended
  9. The remaining growth media and suspension cells were transferred to a E2000 flask
  10. E2000 flask was placed into shaker incubator 15:40 (37 C, 5% CO2, 110 rpm)  




## Summary/ Results

447 million cells were expanded from 1 x E500 flask into 1 x E2000 flask
