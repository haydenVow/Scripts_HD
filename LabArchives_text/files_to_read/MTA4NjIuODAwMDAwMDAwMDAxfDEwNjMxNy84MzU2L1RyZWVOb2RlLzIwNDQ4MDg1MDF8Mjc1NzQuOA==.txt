Protocol

  1. Check gas pressure at regulator for all gases in use. Ensure pressure is the same, and is between 1-3 bar.
  2. Check alarms in warnings and alerts screen. Dismiss any non-applicable alarms. 
  3. Inspect each physical bioreactor and ensure all clamps are sealed. Check the colour and consistency of the broth (e.g. if milky - contamination, or foamy - cell death)
  4. Inspect the bioreactor specs in the software and note if any parameter is out of spec. 

  
  
Deviations & notes

  * Some foaming (very minor) present in all reactors. 
  * All reactors have formed spheroid/aggregates visible by eye. Spheroids have not settled and are still in suspension. 
  * pH not close enough to set points
    * pH loops are on
    * CO2 was gassing in those reactors
    * however, pH on graph was very steady over time -> despite gassing, pH was not moving enough 
    * therefore, increased the max rate for CO2 sparging to 50mL/min and set proportional term to 40 kP (from 10)

StepSample bioreactor & take offline readings  
Operator nameVP  
Time-stamp11:10AM  
Protocol

  1. Follow on-screen prompts to draw sample from the sampling line: 
    * take 1mL draw and discard
    * take 1mL draw and place in 50mL falcon tube
  2. Cell count 0.2mL in 1.5mL tube and record in G-sheet (below)
  3. Return remaining cell suspension from 1.5mL tube to 50mL falcon tube for pH reading
  4. Calibrate pH meter and read values for all samples. Record pH values below in G-sheet

  
  
Deviations & notes

See G-sheet here for offline readings

  * pH offline still not matching online readings (see G-sheet) 
  * cells look healthy by eye under microscope (despite large aggregations)
  * shake flask looks the healthiest
