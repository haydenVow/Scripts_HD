Aim/Purpose: To screen multiple combinations of live/dead immunofluorescent stains that can sufficiently label suspension cultures under florescence.
Hypothesis: We hypothesise that we can improve the accuracy of the live/dead signal by using a different stain.
Technical Gap: We currently do not have a good strategy to identify total numbers of viable cells in suspension. This is blocking the success of our attempts to adapt cells to suspension culture.
Method/Procedure


This experiment will look at the effect of the following variables on
live/dead staining and counting:

  * Cell age:
    * Freshly thawed 
    * In suspension for at least 2 weeks
  * Live stains:
    * Calcein
    * CMFDA
    * Hoechst33342
  * Dead stains:
    * DAPI
    * Sytox green
    * PI

The control will be Trypan blue exclusion counts using a hemocytometer

Method overview:

  1. Transfer 100 uL of samples into 96 wp
  2. Stain each well with 100 uL of respective stain buffer (100 uL of stain in 100 uL of sample for a 50% dilution)
  3. Incubate for 20 min
    1. While incubation is happening, perform Trypan blue counts for the new fresh and the old sample
    2. Calculate live and dead cell counts
  4. Prepare serial dilutions - 25% and 12.5%
  5. Image every well on phase and all 3 fluorescence channels
  6. Count fluorescent nuclei in every image using FIJI macro
  7. Calculate live and dead cell counts for each stain buffer combo
