Testing out solar UVB and UVA detection.

1\. Detach the light sensing probe from the body of the device.

2\. Turn the device on using the power button. Place the probe under the
reptile solar lamp at a distance of 10cm and record the UV intensity after 15
seconds (mw/cm^2 measures)

3\. Move the lamp to various heights from the UV meter probe and record the
differences in UV intensity.

4\. Determine time required to reach a irradiation dose of 600,000 J/m^2 for
each height using the formulas below.

UV light intensity to UV energy conversions:  

Intensity * time = energy  
  
mW/cm2 x seconds = mj/cm2

0.1 mJ/ cm2 = 1 J/m2

  

The desired energy in our samples we want will be 600,000 joules/m^2 which
should give us roughly 4-6 times greater mutational frequency compared to non
irradiated controls (1).

  

600000 joules/m^2 = 60000mJ/cm^2.  
If we wanted to input this energy over 1 h (3600 seconds)...

60000mJ/cm^2 / 3600 seconds = 16.6mW/cm^2

  

If we wanted to accomplish the same dose of UV energy in 30 minutes (1800
seconds) we would require double the UV intensity (33.2mW/cm^2)
