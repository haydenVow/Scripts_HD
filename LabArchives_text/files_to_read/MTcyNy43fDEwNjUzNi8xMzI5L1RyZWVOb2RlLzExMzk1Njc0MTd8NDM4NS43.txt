Batch Objectives/Outline:

  * Produce as much mass as possible for investor tastings

Notable Events:

  * Half of this batch (13x10CS and 1x5CS) peeled a week earlier than anticipated. 
    * There is no obvious reason why this happened although at this point we started filtering our TGFb as it was a potential contamination risk. This could have reduced the TGFb concentration and resulted in faster peeling. However this does not explain why half of the batch peeled early and the other than lasted for the expected amount of time
  *  When harvesting this batch, the aggregates were separated by the incubator. Therefore each tube contained all aggregates from only one incubator, this was done to mitigate the contamination issues, ie. if the flasks in one incubator was contaminated this would only effect the aggregates in that tube. If all aggregates were put into a central tube the entire mass would be considered contaminated.
