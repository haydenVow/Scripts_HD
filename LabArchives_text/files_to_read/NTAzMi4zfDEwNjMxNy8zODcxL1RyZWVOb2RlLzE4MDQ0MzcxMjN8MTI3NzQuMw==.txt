Aim/Purpose


To determin what degree of slope in the 3D printed conical shaped constructs
increases fusion and maturation on collagen gel matrix.


Hypothesis


DOLLY12 cells will have different contractions and therefore maturation
depending on the slope of the conical inserts.


Technical Gap/Background


In a Run 1 experiment we saw different levels of contraction in the cell
containing collagen gels based on the conical inserts used. Therefore, for
this experiment we will further analyse each insert on its effect on the gel
contraction and therefore degree of fusion and maturation.  
  


Method/Procedure


Brief summation:

  * We will prepare cell-laden and cell free collagen gels with or without conical inserts. 
  * Subsequently, we will observe the samples, assessing for cell migration/alignment over 14 days. We will image cells with CMFDA live cell tracker at day 2, to see if there is any effects of changing from prolif media to E6. 
  * On D7 and D14 samples will be primary and secondary stained for MyoG and MF20 (and also DAPI stained) and imaged.  
  
Experiment Plan

Samples:  

Conical insert:

n=2 cell-laden collagen hydrogels on conical inserts (low steepness)

n=1 cell-laden collagen hydrogels on conical inserts (medium steepness)

n=1 cell-laden collagen hydrogels on conical inserts (high steepness)  

n=1 cell-free collagen hydrogels on conical inserts (low steepness)

n=1 cell-free collagen hydrogels on conical inserts (high steepness)

No insert:

n=1 cell-laden collagen hydrogels without inserts  

n=1 cell free collagen hydrogels without inserts

  

= 5 cell-laden samples total

= 3 no - cell samples in total

= 8 samples overall

  

Cell containing:

no insert samples will contain: 450ul collagen sol: 150ul cell suspension
(4:1) - final volume of 600 uL in each well

Conical insert samples will contain: 240ul collagen sol: 60ul cell suspension
(4:1) - final volume of 300 uL in each well

Cell free:

no insert samples: 450 uL collagen sol : 150uL growth media - final volume of
600uL per well.

No cell conical insert samples will contain: 240ul collagen sol: 60ul growth
media  (4:1) - final volume of 300 uL in each well

  

Media requirements:

Cell containing:  
Collagen: 1.410 mL  
Media with cells : 0.390 mL (32.5M cells in 0.390uL of cell suspension media.
Each sample has a seeding density of 16.67M cells per mL)

Cell free:  
Collagen: ~0.93 mL  
Media (no cells): 0.270 mL

  

Experiment timeline and methods

D-10 Culture cells

D-1 Sterilise all inserts

D-1 Prepare media for the experiment:

For seeding:  DMEM/F12 + 20% FBS + 1x P/S (with phenol red) ~16ml

For D1 feeds onward: Differentiation media E6 + 1x P/S (with phenol red)
~130ml for 1 week  

D0 Harvest and encapsulate cells  

  

Prepare plate:

  1. Add sterile inserts into a sterile tray and place the tray onto a non-treated 24-well plate (see plate map below). Place lid ontop and parafilm. Place the plate with the tray and inserts into the fridge for a minimum of 30min before seeding

Cell free seeding in gel

  1. Remove PureCol® EZ Gel solution from 4°C storage (fridge)
  2. Remove the 24 well plate from fridge and remove parafilm
  3. Add 0.270 uL of cold growth media to  0.93 mL of PureCol® EZ Gel 
  4. Whilst suspension is still cold, transfer cell free mix into the wells: 
    1. No insert: 600 uL directly in the middle (n=1)
    2. Conical insert: 300 uL onto the conical inserts (n=2) 

Cells-laden seeding in gel

  1. Prepare cell suspension (32.5M cells in 0.390uL  in GM and place in fridge at 4'C for a minimum of 10 minutes (~1hr max). 
  2. Remove PureCol® EZ Gel solution from 4°C storage (fridge)
  3. Add 0.390uL of the cold cell suspension to 1.410 mL of cold PureCol® EZ Gel solution (ratio of 4:1 gel:cells, based on: https://advancedbiomatrix.com/purecol-ezgel.html) 
  4. Remove the 24 well plate from fridge and remove parafilm
  5. Whilst the cell-gel mix is still cold seed the inserts (IMPORTANT TO BE QUICK SO MIX STAYS COLD):
    1. conical inserts: 300ul per well around the perimeter trough of the insert (n=4)
    2. no inserts: 600ul to the center of the well (n=1)  
  

  6. Move the plate containing the gels into the incubator (37°C, 5% CO2). Gelation will occur within 40 minutes, but allow approximately 60 to minutes for firm gel formation (should start almost immediately).
  7. After 60 minutes (or until gel is firm can take up to 90 min) add pre-warmed proliferation media to each well (DMEM/F12 + 20% FBS + 1x P/S + p38i, enough media to fully immerse samples ~1.5mls per well).  
  
Note - add media gently to the side of the well so as not to dislodge the gels
from the insert
