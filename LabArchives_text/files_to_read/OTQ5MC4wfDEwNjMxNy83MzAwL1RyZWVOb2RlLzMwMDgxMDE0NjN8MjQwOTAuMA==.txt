Transfer XX Vials to LN


Procedure

  1. If required, pierce holes on the bottom of cardboard box for storage in the liquid nitrogen to allow for proper filling and drainage when lifting the rack for future use.
  2. Mark one corner of the box on the lid. Open the lid and then mark the same corner on the box. This will allow for identification of the positions of vials.
  3. Label the Lid with Rows (A-I) and Columns (1-9).
  4. Check for available racks and slots for these boxes and label each box with Rack number and box number on both the lid and the box.
  5. Place in the liquid nitrogen dewer for at least 1 hr prior to transferring cryovials in.
  6. When ready for transferring cryovials, remove the Mr Frostys' from the -80C freezer and a pre-frozen storage box onto the work bench. Use esky lids to hold the boxes and Mr Frosty's to prevent liquid nitrogen spillage and sliding on the bench top. Immediately transfer cryovials into the pre-labelled box, using tweezers, in numerical order and note the starting and ending locations of the vials.  
  7. Place filled boxes immediately back into the liquid nitrogen until all vials have been transferred.
  8. Update Stockyard v2 with all locations for each vial.
