After drying overnight the cell sheets had dried and hardened and as such
could not be lifted from the petri dishes. With the exception of conditions
1.8,2.8, 1.4 and 2.4 (i.e. the treatments seeded in the collagen gel
suspension) the sheets had also completly shriveled up to less than 0.5cm by
0.5cm size pieces. Whereas the collagen suspension cultures were still spread
across the base of the plate. It was subsequently decided to try and re-
hydrate the collagen suspension cultures. Approximately 5ml of plain DMEM was
added to each dish (enough to cover the base of the plates) and the samples
left for approximately 1hr.

After the 1hr in growth media it was found that the sheets could again be
lifted.

Using a sterile scalpel, spatula and tweezers the sheets (cells in collagen
fed with both media conditions) were cut into as many small (homogeneous in
size by eye only) pieces as possible, then placed into a 48-wp.  
  
Based on the number of attained samples the following experimental plan was
formulated and the samples plated as follows:  
  

New plan:

Condition 1 (C1) = 1.8 and 2.8

Condition 2 (C2) = 1.4 and 2.4

  

Total ACF cells needed = 18.4M

Total Serum cells needed = 18.4M    (NOTE - If we do not have enough serum
cells only do n=3 serum for each seeding density and use extra samples as cell
free or add as an extra ACF replicate)

  

  

  




1x 2-level Categorical factor (scaffold type):  Condition 1 (1.8 and 2.8) and
Condition 2 (1.4 and 2.4)

1x 2-level Continuous factor (seeding density): 0.8M, 1.5M cells/96-well sized
scaffold

1x 2-level Continuous factor (media): ACF, Serum  
  
Cells seeded in 10C ACF media, then transitioned to E6 on D2 in proliferation
media (= D0 of differentiation)

  
8 ACF conditions (seeded in 10C):  
  
(1) ACF, Condition 1, 0.8M cells/scaffold

(2) Serum, Condition 1, 0.8M cells/scaffold

  

(3) ACF, Condition 1, 1.5M cells/scaffold  
(4) Serum, Condition 1, 1.5M cells/scaffold

(5) ACF, Condition 2, 0.8M cells/scaffold

(6) Serum, Condition 2, 0.8M cells/scaffold

  

(7) ACF, Condition 2, 1.5M cells/scaffold  
(8) Serum, Condition 2, 1.5M cells/scaffold

  

Replicates: n=4

Total number of samples (4 x 8) = 32

  

1 Cell free control conditions (n=4):

Condition 2
