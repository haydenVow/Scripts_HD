### Process:

1\. Took image of vessel with microscope on phase setting.

3\. Aliquotted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then
placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath for a minimum of 20 minutes
prior to use:

  1. TrypLE:     1 x 9mL (T25s)  mL in    1     tubes
  2.  dPBS (for neutralising):      3 x 3mL   mL
  3.  dPBS (for washing):     9mL    mL
  4. Growth media (for pellet resuspension):    3 x 1mL (20% FBS for clones)      mL
  5. Growth media (for seeding):    3 x 5mL (20% FBS)    mL 

Time that all aliquots were placed in the water bath the warm before use
13:57 pm

Note: if aliquots were placed in water bath at different time, record the time
stamp for each individual solution.




4\. Removed vessel(s) from the incubator   : pm

5\. Washed the vessel(s) with dPBS (warmed).

6\. Added   3mL per T25  mL tryple to each vessel/well and incubated at 37˚C.

  1. Start/Finish for TrypLE was   14:21 pm 

7\. Neutralised with    3mL/flask   dPBS and combined cell suspension into a
1 x tube each.

8\. Centrifuged at 650 x g for 5 min.

  1. Start/Finish time for centrifugation was    14:41  pm 




9\. Aspirated the supernatant(s).

10\. Resuspended pellet(s) in    0.5     mL    Growth      media

11\. Aliquoted      10uL    of each resuspended cells into a microcentrifuge
tube for cell count.

12\. Performed a cell count using the haemocytometer and recorded the cell
count data in the Google Doc spreadsheet: Cell Count Spreadsheet or cell count
widget below

  1. Total cell number was:      see spreadsheet       

  2. Volume of cell suspension required for subculture was:       see below      

  3. Cell density per vessel:      175,000 cells per flask      




F_DOLLY12_1A16: Transferred      86     µl of cell suspension to the pre-
warmed       5    mL Growth media:     :  pm

F_DOLLY12_3P23: Transferred      465     µl of cell suspension to the pre-
warmed       5    mL Growth media:     :  pm

F_DOLLY12_4C4: Transferred       84    µl of cell suspension to the pre-warmed
5    mL Growth media:     :  pm

14\. Transferred cell suspension into   1 x T25 flask per clone  vessel.

16\. Transferred vessel(s) to incubate at:

  * [ X ]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (avian cells)

17\. Placed in incubator at 15:50 pm (Library - bottom binder #68)




Observations/Summary:

3 clones passaged from 1 x T25 into 1 x T25 and seeded at 7,000 cells / cm2

Not much growth from clone F_DOLLY12_3P23
