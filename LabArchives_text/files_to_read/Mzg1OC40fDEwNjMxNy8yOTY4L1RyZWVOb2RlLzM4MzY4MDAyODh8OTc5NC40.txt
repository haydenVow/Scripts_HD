Media

NOTE BEFORE PREP MEDIA - CHECK MEDIA REQUIREMENTS FOR COLLAGEN EXPERIMENT AND
MAKE AT THE SAME TIME, SEE LINK  

100ml of proliferation media: DMEM/F12 + 20% FBS + 1x P/S +p38i (with phenol
red)

130ml of differentiation media: E6 + 1x P/S (with phenol red) ~130ml for 1
week (make again on D6 diff)  

Proliferation media with 1mg/ml ACA (OR could instead just make up
proliferation media then add fresh ACA on the day of use > filter, as I'm not
sure of stability)  

1) Add 50mg  52 mg  of ACA to 50ml of DMEM/F12 + 10% FBS + 1X P/S + p38i
11:00  
2) Mix well and then sterile filter.  
3) Store in the fridge.  102

E6 media with 1mg/ml ACA (note or add fresh ACA each time on the day of use
then filter, I'm not sure of stability)  

1) Add 130mg of ACA exact amount added  to 130ml of E6 + 1x P/S (prepared
earlier)  timestamp  

2) Mix well and then sterile filter  
3) Store in the fridge (no longer than 1 week)

Note -  Ensure all reagents are sterile or have been sterile filtered prior to
use

  

20mM CaCl2:

1) In a 100ml bottle (autoclaved glass bottle or sterile plastic vessel) add
0.555g of CaCl2 granules 565 mg  into 50mL of pre-prepared proliferation media
11:00  

2) stir until dissolved > sterile filter (either stir on stir plate with an
ethanol cleaned or pre-autoclaved stir bar or physically shake/rock the bottle
until dissolved)

3) Store in fridge 102

Bovine concentrated plasma fibrinogen stock (8mg/ml):  

IMPORTANT NOTE READ ALL- The optimal way to solubilize fibrinogen is to layer
it on top of warm (37 ºC) saline, as fibrinogen will not dissolve in water.
The saline concentration can be in the range of 0.85-0.9%.  The fibrinogen-
saline solution can be gently agitated, but it must not be vortexed. The
fibrinogen will slowly dissolve to give a hazy solution. Fibrinogen may be
sterile-filtered, but may not go through a 0.1 μ filter. A 0.2 μ filter is
suggested, with positive pressure using a syringe and "button" filter.  Vacuum
filtration should not be used, since this will lead to breakdown of the
molecule during the filtration.

Note - The Kaplan method asks for dilution in H2O, however, considering the
above advice from Sigma we will use PBS.

Note - Use a ethanol cleaned and dried or pre-autoclaved stir bar

NOTE - FIBRINOGEN WILL TAKE A LONG TIME TO DISSOLVE ADD VERY SLOWLY TO
STIRRING PRE-WARMED PBS (MAY HAVE TO LEAVE STIRRING FOR HOURS AND INVERT - BUT
DO NOT VORTEX)

1) Sterile filter 4ml of PBS and warm to 37'C on a stir plate (can use a small
glass beaker)

2) Add a pre-autoclaved or ethanol cleaned and dried stir bar to the vessel

3) Make sure the temperature probe is in the liquid and has been ethanol wiped
down before use

4)  While stirring VERY slowly add 32mg total (8mg per ml) exact amount added
of the fibrinogen into the warmed PBS (do not vortex!)  timestamp

5) LEAVE STIRRING UNTIL DISSOLVED - WILL TAKE A WHILE!

5) Sterile filter solution using a 0.2 μ syringe filter.  (This is enough for
12 samples!)  timestamp  

6) Store solution in the fridge until use 102

Note - do not store stock sol for longer than 4 days in the fridge

pre-warmed thh PBS and then just gently poured the weighed poweder on top, no
agitation whatsoever. the crystals slowly soaked full of PBS and fell to
bottom of the glass vial, dissolving slowly along the way

6-Aminocaproic acid ACA stock solution (20mg/ml):

1) Add 60mg of ACA into 3ml dH2O (sterile filtered MilliQ) 60 mg  

2) Mix well and sterile filter  11:00  

3) Store solution at room temperature until use Biomaterials bench

Note - if this is too small a volume to handle just make up 3x amount, for the
gel samples we should only need 504ul, at 42ul per sample.

Note - The buffer is stable indefinitely at room temperature.

Thrombin stock solution (10mg/ml):

1) Add 10mg of Thrombin into 1.5ml of dH2O (sterile filtered MilliQ)

2) Mix well and sterile filter 11:00  

3) Store solution in the fridge until use 102

Note - we should only need 1.08ml total (1080ul total, 90ul per sample, for 12
samples).

Note - Stock solutions of thrombin remain active for ~one week at 0-5 °C.
