Integral to all experimental work conducted in the field of science involves
the use of experimental controls, which are necessary in order to determine if
a particular treatment is exerting a measurable effect. Majority of suspension
work conducted with fibroblast cells in the past have not included a cell line
that is already adapted to suspension as an experimental control. Several
commercial suspension cell lines are readily available for purchase most
common of which is the CHO-S cell line. Therefore, the purpose of this
experiment is to generate an MCB of CHO-S that are readily available to use in
the R&D conducted by the science team at Vow.
