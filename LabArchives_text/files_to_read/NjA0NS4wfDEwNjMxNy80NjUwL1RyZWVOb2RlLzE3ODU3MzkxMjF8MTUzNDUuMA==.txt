Process:

  1. Remove 18 shake tubes from the incubator 13:50
  2. Mix Take 100uL sample from each culture and place into a well of 96 well plate. Take 20 uL from each culture and place into a 1.5 mL tube.
  3. Returned vessels to incubator   14:15     

  1. Plate map(s) of culture IDs in 96-WP for imaging

### IF Staining Process

  1. Prepared stain solution by combining the following (3 drops Hoechst and 1 drop Cytox per 1 mL of dPBS):
    1. _4_ mL of filtered dPBS (does not have to be sterile - filtered to remove debris)
    2. _12_ drops of NucBlue Live Cell Stain ReadyFlow Hoechst 33342
    3. _4_ drops of NucGreen Dead 488 Cell Stain ReadyProbes Sytox Green
  2. Added 100uL of stain solution from column 1 into column 2 and into column 8 of the 96 well plates.
  3. Incubated plates in stain at RT in dark for 20 - 30 minutes    14:20 - 14:50     

    1. while waiting, ensure you have 100uL/well of PBS in columns 3,4,9, and 10 of the 96 wp.  

  4. Performed serial dilution by hand to achieve a 12.5% final dilution: 
    1. Pipette mixed and moved 100 uL of 50% stain solution + cell suspension into wells containing 100 uL of filtered dPBS 
    2. Pipette mixed and moved 100 uL of 25% stain solution + cell suspension + dPBS into wells containing 100 uL of filtered dPBS
    3. Pipette mixed and moved 100 uL of 12.5% stain solution + cell suspension + dPBS into empty wells for 100 uL of 12.5% dilution 
  5. Centrifuged the 96-well plate at 650 RCF for 1 minute. Timestamp:   15:30  
  6. Took whole well micrographs using the Zaber microscope on blue & green fluorescence channels (DAPI & 488).  Timestamp:    15:30
    * Culture ID images were stored under:     8158    
    * When imaging, in the notes include: 'Day 28, plate 1, attempt2' or 'Day 28, plate 2, attempt2'  




Haemocytomer count

  1. 20uL of trypan blue was added to each 20uL sample and mixed. 10uL from this solution was loaded onto the haemocytometer for a count.
  2. Phase, 10x was used to look at the haemocytometer slide. Example image below:

### Observations/Summary:

Zaber observations/issues:

IF stained 18 suspension culture (see IDs in the table at the top) and
performed haemocytomer counts for all of them.

There was signal visible on DAPI channel.

When using the haemocytomer, no cells were visible for any cultures.
Occasionally, there were small, mostly round objects visible that were assumed
to be debris because they were much smaller than cells that we usually see.
Therefore, the count was 0 for all cultures. Example of a representative
haemocytomer slide is included.

We also took images of the 96 wp on Phase to show the small cells (or possibly
debris). It's possible that the suspension adaptation process has resulted in
a change in size of the cells.
