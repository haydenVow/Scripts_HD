Performed by:


Prepare media (note - prepping media for FACS and OT2 seeding, only FACS
sorting 4 plates total)

 ~~ ~~CDM4 Avian  ~~~~

 ~~Volume medium required: [4] x [96] x [200] + 10 mL buffer = 86 mL  ~~

HyCell CHO (CHOMP suspension medium)

Volume medium required: [8] x [96] x [200] + 10 mL buffer = 165 mL




Prepare plates

  1. Added 200 uL/well of Growth Medium to plates using OT2 (link to protocol below)
  2. Parafilm plates before closing the lid (sterile-side down, facing wells, as demonstrated in image below) & then parafilm lids and plates together (same fashion as is done for fix and stained plates in fridge) for transport to SCC facility 

  




Opentron setup

  1. Fill 8 wells of 12-well reservoir with 11.5 mL media per well
    1. Wells 1-4: CDM4Avian medium 
    2. Wells 5-8: HyCell CHOMP suspension medium 
  2. Load deck as shown below  

  3. Run protocol (attached below) 




Prepare FACS buffer

  1. Prepared 20 mL of FACS buffer (PRF DMEM/F12 + 2% FBS).
    1. 400 uL FBS + 19.6 mL PRF DMEM/F12
  2. Sterile filter through a 0.2 µm filter.
  3. Store at 4ºC until needed




Prepare 1 styrofoam boxes to transfer to SCC facility

1 Box with:

  * Pre-filled (medium) multi-well plates, parafilmed
  * An ice pack
  * Hoechst (ddH20) - vial is located in large new fridge in library lab, top shelf of door in 70 mL urine container
  * Extra FACS Buffer
  * Tube containing cells
