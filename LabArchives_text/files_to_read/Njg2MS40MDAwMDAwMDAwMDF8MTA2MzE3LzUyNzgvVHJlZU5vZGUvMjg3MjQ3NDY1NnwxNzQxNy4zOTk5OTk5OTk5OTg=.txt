Background  
The limbs of a male Salt Water Crocodile limbs have been sourced from Koorana
Crocodile Farm, 65 Savages Rd, Coowonga QLD 4702 and will be transported to
the Vowse in a chilled esky. Biopsies taken from this crocodile meat will be
processed into crude homogenate and subsequently cultured with a view to
selecting and expanding a plastic adherent population of cells. This will be
Vows first attempt at isolating and culturing reptilian cells.

The media formulation used for the outgrowth culture in this study was based
upon the previous successful culture of crocodilian fibroblasts by Hyndman,
T.H., et al [1]
