RELATED TO MILESTONE:  Milestone 2A-- Perform at least 2 harvests in ACF on
cytodex microcarriers

AIM/PURPOSE: To perform at least 2 sequential harvests of cells grown in ACF
media on Cytodex microcarriers.

HYPOTHESIS: Harvesting methods using for cells grown in serum containing media
will work at a similar efficiency for cells grown in ACF media.

RESULTS SUMMARY: Cells/microcarrier in ACF media conditions were significantly
lower than serum by day 4 of proliferation and this continued up to day 7 of
culture. Harvesting cells from E810C at this point resulted in an insufficient
number of cells to reseed E125 flasks.

Note: The TGFb used in this experiment was not reconstituted according to the
manufacturer's instructions which may have impacted results.

CONCLUSIONS: Cells did not proliferate on Cytodex microcarriers in ACF media.
Using protease inhibitor cocktail for neutralising trypsin may be a good
alternative to using serum based media for neutralisation.

NEXT STEPS: We will need to develop high-throughput methods of culturing
microcarriers to test more media conditions and harvesting methods in the
future.
