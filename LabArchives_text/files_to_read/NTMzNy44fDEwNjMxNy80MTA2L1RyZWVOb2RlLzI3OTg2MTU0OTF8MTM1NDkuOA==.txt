Reagent preparation:

3\. Prepared Secondary Antibody mix (pipette from the top/supernatant of
antibody solution):

  0.5 µL   Secondary #1   (1:1000  ) +  0.5 µL   Secondary #2   (1:1000  ) +
0.5  mL Blocking Buffer (PBST (0.1% Triton X + dPBS) + 3% BSA)  

If using AlexaFluor secondary antibodies then the max concentration should be
1:500 (typically used at 1:1000)

Pipette-mixed antibody mix and stored refrigerated away from light until
needed.

4\. Prepared DAPI mix:

   0.5 mL  PBS +    0.5 uL  of DAPI (1:1000)

Vortexed DAPI mix and stored refrigerated away from light until needed.

3\. Incubated the cells with secondary antibody mixture in the dark at RT for
1 hour.  : - : pm

NOTE: from this step onwards protect from the light by wrapping plates in foil
and perform experiment in the dark.




Counter staining
