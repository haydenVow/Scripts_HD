Experimental Observations:

No Treatment Flasks:

  * All cells settled to the bottom of the flask. After some swirling all cells when back into suspension - with a few visible cell clumps

  

  

VitC (50ug/mL) (ONLY) Flasks:

  * Cells settled to the very bottom but went back into suspension after some swirling. There are some strands of cell clumps but not significantly different from that in controls

  

VitC (50ug/mL) + TGFb (10ng/mL) Flasks:

  * Again, cells just settled to the bottom of the flask. Cells went back into suspension after swirling with a few visible strand clumps, but not significantly different from controls.
