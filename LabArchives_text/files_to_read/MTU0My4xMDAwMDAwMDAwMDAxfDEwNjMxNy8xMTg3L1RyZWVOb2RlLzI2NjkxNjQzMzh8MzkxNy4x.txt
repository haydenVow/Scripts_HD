### Process:

1\. USED PER-COATED 5CF GIFTED FROM PRODUCTION - Flasks coated on 6/05/21

3\. Aliquotted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then
placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath for a minimum of 20 minutes
prior to use:

  1. TrypLE:     60  mL in    1     container
  2.  dPBS (At 37 degrees for washing):    60   mL 
  3.  dPBS (at RT neutralising):     60    mL 
  4. Growth media (for pellet resuspension):      10 mL 
  5. Growth media (for seeding):      1.5 L in      3x 500ul containers  

Time that all aliquots were placed in the water bath the warm before use
13:55

Note: if aliquots were placed in water bath at different time, record the time
stamp for each individual solution.




4\. Removed vessel(s) from the incubator   14:25

5\. Washed the vessel(s) with dPBS (warmed).

6\. Added     10    mL tryple to each vessel/well and incubated at 37˚C.

  1. Start/Finish for TrypLE was    14:35 :  14:45   

7\. Neutralised with     10     dPBS and combined cell suspension into
4x50ml   tubes.

8\. Centrifuged at 650 x g for 5 min.

  1. Start/Finish time for centrifugation was     :   a/pm 




9\. Aspirated the supernatant(s).

10\. Resuspended pellet(s) in    6.5     mL       growth   media   15:30  

11\. Aliquoted      2x 50ul    of resuspended cells into a microcentrifuge
tube for cell count.

12\. Performed a cell count using the haemocytometer and recorded counts in
cell count spread sheet. Avearage total cell count: 8.359M cells total  

  




  

13\. Transferred  entire cell suspension to the pre-warmed       1.5    L
Growth media:     15:45  

14\. Transferred cell suspension into the pre-gelatin coated      10CF
vessel.

15\. Left at RT in the BSC for 30 min to allow cells to settle      15:55  

16\. Transferred vessel(s) to incubate at: 16:35

  * [x]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells) thermo incubator
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (avian cells)

Version Change Log

NameChange Details  
V1 (original)N/A  
V2Changed all sentences to past tense to better reflect a hand-written lab
book entry.  
Various formatting changes.  
Addition of more detail to step 2, removal of step 3. Replaced volume
requirements table with updated volumes @Sep 22, 2020  
Updated temperature selection for mammalian/aviary cells @Sep 23, 2020  
V3Included a section for 'vessel type' in passage ID table Replace
'flask/plate' with 'vessel' throughout lab book Include at step 1 to take
image of vessel on the microscope  
Mentioned that dPBS for washing should be warm - step 3(2) and 5.  
Added timepoint at step 4 for when vessel is removed from incubator  
Include at step 11 to aliquot cell resuspension into microcentrifuge tube  
Included at step 10 and 13 time point for when cell pellet is resuspended and
when resuspended cells is moved into growth media.  
Included p38i in table of regent used  
Combined two dPBS entries in 'Media/reagents' table Added 'cell density per
vessel'
