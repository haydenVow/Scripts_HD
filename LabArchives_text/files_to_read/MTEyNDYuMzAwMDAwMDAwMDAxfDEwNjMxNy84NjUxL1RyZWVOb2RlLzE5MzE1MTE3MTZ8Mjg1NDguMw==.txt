CHO + NuvonisM12746545 mL


Method/Procedure
  
  
1\. Made up 1.090L of 50/50 RPMI/CHO

2\. Split 1.090L into 3 x E500 containing 363mL of media each.

3\. Placed flasks in incubator 159, set @ 37'C, 5% CO2 and shaking at 120 rpm
for at least 2h.

4\. Removed flasks from incubator and adjusted pH values from 7.3 to 7.21,
7.52 and 7.81 by taking a pH reading and adding different volumes of either
NaOH or HCl as per below:

  1. Flask set at 7.21: Added 420uL of HCl and 25uL of NaOH 
  2. Flask set at 7.52: Added 500uL of NaOH
  3. Flask set at 7.81: Added 1.4mL of NaOH

5\. Once pH was adjusted, sterile filtered the media using three different
500mL sterile filter units.
