Key Result(s)


  * No significant difference in pellet weight was observed between the control and vitamin C seeded conditions after 4 and 8 days in continuous culture. 


Discussion of Results


Following from the results of the previous Nuvonis vitamin C experiment
(link), this study sought to investigate if the addition of vitamin C over an
extended period could increase the yield obtained from suspension cultures. To
evaluate this Nuvonis cells were seeded directly into growth media which
either had vitamin C present or absent and cultured over 4 days. The cultures
were pelleted, weighed and reseeded in 100% fresh growth media containing
Vitamin C and cultured for an additional 4 days. After 8 days all cultures
were harvested for a final weighing.

  

Pellet weights obtained after 4 days of culture highlighted that the average
weight of cell pellets from both the control and vitamin C seeded conditions
were not significantly different from each other. Similarly, 2 way anova
analysis of day 8 pellet weights demonstrated that there was no significant
difference between the 2 even after a further 4 days in continuous culture.
Additionally with the increase of technical replicates to 8 per condition it
is evident that the variance observed in the previous experiment was likely by
chance and not a direct effect from Vitamin C.

Limitations


No limitations were observed in this experiment.


Conclusion(s)


No significant difference in pellet weight was observed between the control
and vitamin C seeded conditions after 4 and 8 days in continuous culture.


Future Direction(s)


  * Increase the duration the cells are cultured in Vitamin C, >14 days.
  * Treat cultures with cell density >1M cells/mL with Vitamin C over an extended period, > 14 days.
