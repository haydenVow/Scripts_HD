Aim/Purpose


To determine whether a fast growing single cell line can be derived from a
heterogeneous population of F_CHOMP09 cells


Hypothesis


We hypothesise that we will attain â‰¥1 single cell line that outperforms our
current heterogeneous population of F_CHOMP09 cells in terms of doubling rate


Technical Gap


We have not yet attempted to single-cell sort any of our CHOMP cell lines, and
do not know whether they will survive the process. Our CHOMP fibroblasts have
slow doubling rates (~96H), and we need to reduce this in order to achieve
adequate cell mass in a shorter period of time in order to meet our goal of
feeding millions of people. Isolating fast growing cells within our
heterogeneous population is one method of achieving this.

9-Nov-2021D0 FACS sort into 4 x 384-well plates:

  1. Prepare 4 x plates with gelatin fresh adherent growth medium (D/F+20%FBS+1xP/S+10ng/mL FGF)
  2. Prepare 1 x ULA plates with NO GELATIN and fresh suspension growth medium (RPMI+20%FBS+1xP/S+10ng/mL FGF)
  3. Prepare 20 mL FACS Buffer
  4. Harvest fibroblasts from T175s
  5. Take to Garvan and sort 
  6. Centrifuge plates
  7. Transport plates back to Vowse, place in incubator

19-Nov-2021D10Zaber scan plates  
Top up wells with 20 uL per well fresh growth mediumCheck if any wells are
over-confluent. If so, perform picking on D11 and adjust next time to do
picking earlier. It not, can wait and scan again in a couple of days.  
  
22-Nov-2021D13Zaber scan plates  
  
  
23-Nov-2021D15Pick high confluence wells from 384-well to 96-well plates  
Generate pick-list through Hoechst-staining and imaging cells on Zaber then
running through macro. Passage on same day to remove Hoechst, or perform 100%
feed  
  
  
When confluent, expand top clones from 96-well plate to 24-well plate  
  
  
  
When confluent, expand top clones from 24-well plate to 6-well plate  
  
  
  
When confluent, expand top clones from 6-well plate to T25 flasks  
  
  
  
When confluent, expand top clones from T25 flasks to T75 flasks or 125 shake
flasks  
  
  
  
When confluent, expand top clones from T75 flasks to T175 flasks or 250 shake
flasks  
  
  
  
When confluent, expand top clones from T175 flasks to Multi-layered cell
factory flasks or 2L shake flasks  
  
  
  
  
Generate MCB_2 of successful clonal populations.
