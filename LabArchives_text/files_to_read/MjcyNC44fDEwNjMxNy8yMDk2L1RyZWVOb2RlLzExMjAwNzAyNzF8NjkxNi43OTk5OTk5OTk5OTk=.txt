AIM/PURPOSE: We have experienced a lot of cell death in our current C2C12 WCB.
Our MCB appears to still be viable so we will again expand this to a WCB.

HYPOTHESIS: C2C12 cells expanded from our MCB will be viable and will not die
off prematurely.

RESULTS SUMMARY: 1 vial (500,00 cells) was thawed from the MCB and expanded
over a period of 5 days during which time they underwent 1 passage. A total of
80 million cells was then harvested. There was no apparent cell death during
this expansion.  

CONCLUSIONS: This 2nd cell expansion of C2C12s to a WCB was successful, with a
final bank of 80 million, apparently healthy cells.

NEXT STEPS: It is unclear why C2C12 cells thawed from the 1st WCB died
unexpectedly. We have also recently experienced death of our MOCHA cells as
well as DOLLY fibroblasts. The issue may be due to possible malfunction/ or
improper maintenance of the Thermo Incubator in main lab. This will be
investigated further.
