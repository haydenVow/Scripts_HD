  1. Took 1 x 510 uL sample from each flask in continuous culture (EPIC31425).
  2. Performed counts using Vicell and recorded the counts on Team media spreadsheet.
  3. Aliquoted 600mL 50/50 RPMI/CHO + Nuvonis ingredients.
    1. Added the volume of EGF, IGF, Glucose, L-glutamine, L-alanyl L-glutamine, Hypoxanthine and Thymidine as per the last table on the E8 calculator.  
  
  
  
  

  4. Took X mL of cell suspension containing 100M cells from EPIC31425 and centrifuged @ 500 xg for 5 minutes.
  5. In the meantime, added 49 mL of pre-warmed media to each flask.
  6. After centrifugation, aspirated the supernatant and resuspended cell pellet in 10 mL of pre-warmed media so that cell density is 10M cells/mL.
  7. Dispensed 1 mL of cell suspension into each flask.
    1. Pipette up and down regularly before dispensing cells into media to ensure even seeding.
  8. Replaced E125 in incubator at 37'C, 5% CO2, shaking @120 rpm

  




-Made up 400g/L of glucose by adding 200g of Glucose into 500mL of MilliQ water. Placed in the water bath to allow for the glucose to dissolve. Then left stirring on a hot plate over lunch.
