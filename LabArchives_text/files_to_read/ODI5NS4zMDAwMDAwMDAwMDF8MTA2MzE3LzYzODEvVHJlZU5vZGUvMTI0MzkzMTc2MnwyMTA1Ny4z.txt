### Process:

1\. Took images of each vessel with microscope on phase setting (10X and 4X).

2\. Aliquoted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then
placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath for a minimum of 20 minutes
prior to use:

  1. TrypLE:   15  mL in   1 x 15 mL  tube
  2.  dPBS (for neutralising & washing):   30  mL
  3. Growth media (for pellet resuspension):  3 mL   

  4. Growth media (for seeding):    32  mL

Time that all aliquots were placed in the water bath the warm before use
14:45 - 15:34  

Note: if aliquots were placed in water bath at different time, record the time
stamp for each individual solution.




3\. Removed vessel(s) from the incubator  15:35  

4\. Washed the vessel(s) with dPBS (warmed):

  * 5 mL T75
  * 10mL T175  

5\. Added tryple to each vessel/well:

  * 5mL T75
  * 10mL T175

and incubated at 30˚C.

6\. Start/Finish for TrypLE was     15:39 - 15:44  

7\. Neutralised with dPBS and moved the cell suspension into   1 x 50 mL  tube  

8\. Centrifuged at 300 x g for 5 min. Start time for centrifugation was
15:46-15:49  




8\. Aspirated the supernatant.

9\. Resuspended pellet in   2  mL   growth  medium  

10\. Aliquoted   10 uL  of resuspended cells into a microcentrifuge tube for
cell count.

11\. Performed a cell count using the haemocytometer and recorded the cell
count data in the Google Doc spreadsheet: Cell Count Spreadsheet or cell count
widget below

  1. Total cell number was:    

    * CHOMP09:   2.9 M cells    

  2. Volume of cell suspension required for subculture was:    

    * CHOMP09 
    * 899 uL for T175
  3. Cell density per vessel:   ~7500 cells/cm2   
  4. Add cell counts to the doublings calculator to allow tracking over time: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1kiVXcsre8aDPtA9DjQ84WzN0dLb7jrzD9GehzExe7Ng/edit#gid=0  




12\. Added media to T-flasks (as per table at start of this entry)  

13\. Added cell suspension into vessels as per Seeder 500 widget (above)

14\. Transferred vessel(s) to incubate at:   16:10 , incubator #82 main lab  

  * [ ]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (avian cells)
  * [x]  30ºC, 5% CO2 (reptilian cells)
