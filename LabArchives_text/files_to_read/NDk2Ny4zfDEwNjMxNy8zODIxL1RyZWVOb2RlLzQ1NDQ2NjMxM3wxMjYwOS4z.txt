Overview:

Thawing 5 x vials of C2C12 WCBs (500K) and seeding:

  * \- 96 well plate (all wells) @ 5000 cells per well - DSD main plate - using non-TC treated plate so antibody staining is not influence by coating
  * \- 96 well plate (8 wells only) @ 5000 cells per well - DSD control plate - using non-TC treated plate so antibody staining is not influence by coating
  * \- 24 well plate (6 wells only) @ 40,000 cells per well
  * \- 24 well plate (6 wells only) @ 40,000 cells per well
  * \- 12 well plate (all wells) @ 60,000 cells per well
  * \- 12 well plate (all wells) @ 60,000 cells per well 

So the total cells being seeded are:

  * \- 520,000 cells for the DSD plates in 15mL
  * \- 480,000 cells for the Bradford plates 6mL
  * \- 1,440,000 cells for the E-stim plates in 24mL

Hence, the total cells needed is roughly 2,500,000 cells

Aliquotted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then
placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath for a minimum of 20 minutes
prior to use:

  *  Growth media (for seeding): 
  * 15mL (96 well plate (full) + 96 well plate (8 wells) 
  *  6mL  (24 well plate  (6 wells)) + 24 well plate (6 wells)
  * 24mL (12 well plate (all wells)) + 12 well plate (all wells)  
  * Time that aliquot was placed in the water bath to warm before use:   10:24 a/pm 

  




## Thaw and seed vial:

3\. Collected the cryovial from Liquid Nitrogen storage & place in foam
floater in water bath for 5 min  10:58 - 11:03: a/pm

Location where cryovial was collected from:

Vial details:  5   x  1mL  cryovials at  500 K  cells each for a total of
2.5 M  cells

Brew

Tower/Bucket # 2

Box/Cane # 6

Vial location: A4, A5, A6, A7, A8

Vial ID(s):

You need:

  * 520,000 cells for the DSD plates in 15mL
  * 480,000 cells for the Bradford plates 6mL
  * 1,440,000 cells for the E-stim plates in 24mL

  

4\. Ethanol sprayed & transferred the vial(s) to the BSC.

5\.  Added  500µL of Growth Media (to generate a total volume of 1mL in the
cryovial) to each of the 5 cryovials, resuspended the cell suspension gently
to reduce osmotic shock.

6\. Collected the entire 1mL of cell suspension from the first cryovial and
transferred it to 14mL of GM (total vol. 15mL). This is the media used for DSD
seeding.

Collected the entire 1mL of cell suspension from the second cryovial and
transferred it to 5mL of GM (total vol. 6mL). This is the media used for
Bradford seeding).

Collected the entire 3mL of cell suspension from the remaining three cryovial
and transferred it to 21mL of GM (total vol. 24mL). This is the media used for
E-stim seeding).

7\. Using a 10mL serological pipette, resuspended & distributed the cells
evenly in each GM aliquot.

8\. Transfered 140uL of DSD cells to every well of the first 96 well plate,
and then 140uL to only 8 wells in the second 96 well plate.

Transfered 500uL of Bradford cells to six wells of the first 24 well plate,
and then 500uL to six wells in the second 24 well plate.

Transferred 1mL of E-stim cells to all wells in both 12 well plates.

Allow to rest in the BSC at RT for 30 min  11:10 - 11:40 a/pm

9\. Transfered flask/plate(s) to incubate at:

  * [x ]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (aviary cells)

  

Making labels

Note - You will need to increase the passage number by one. (i.e. if your
thawed vial ID has a passage number of 3, when you make a culture ID for you
vessel you will need change the passage number to 4 on Airtable.)
