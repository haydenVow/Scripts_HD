Harvest Process:

Aliquoted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then
placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath > 30 minutes prior to use

  1. Observed cultures under the microscope and recorded confluence in the table above. 
  2. Imaged cultures on 10x magnification (captured in Mia)
  3. TrypLE:   300  mL 
  4. dPBS (for washing & neutralising)   450 mL
  5. Growth media (for pellet resuspension and seeding):   60 mL
  6. Washed the flask(s) with dPBS.
  7. Added   200  and 100 mL  tryple to each vessel/well and incubated at 37ËšC for    10 mins 
  8. Neutralised with   200 and 100 mL dPBS (warmed) and combined cell suspension into   50 and 250 mL tubes.
  9. Centrifuged at 650 x g for 5 min.
  10. Aspirated+ discarded supernatant
  11. Resuspended pellet(s) in     30 and 30mL media.  
Performed cell count triplicates using the hemocytometer and recorded the cell
count data in widget or the Google Doc spreadsheet called 'Cell Count
Spreadsheet' (see link below):

  12. Total cell number was:   
KHAKIO - 262,260,000  
MUSCO - 83,200,000




Cell Plating Process:

  1. Calculated the total number of cells needed for this assay + margin of error.
  2. Calculated volume of resuspension for column 2 + margin of error. See attached calculations as an example: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1LJ8o3Vk9UI4z1t0zFdHdsyM1I83PEtl0xqi00w4_Yw/edit#gid=1244524761 
  3. Centrifuged required cells at 650 g x 5 mins: 
  4.  Label tubes for each dilution. 
  5. Aspirated + discarded supernatant. 
  6. Resuspended pellet in required volume: 1200 ul 
  7. Performed a serial dilution (1 mL media : 1 mL cells) into each corresponding tube. 
  8. Dispensed 100 ul of cells per well to each corresponding column. 
  9. Dispensed 100 ul of media to the media columns. 

  




Assay Process:

  1. Added 10 ul of WST-8 Solution per wells. 
  2. Measured the absorbance increase at 460nm at time points below:
