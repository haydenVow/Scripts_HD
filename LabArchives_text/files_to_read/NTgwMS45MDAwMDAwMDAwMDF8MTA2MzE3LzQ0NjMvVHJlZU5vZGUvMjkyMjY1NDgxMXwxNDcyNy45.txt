Aim/Purpose


To achieve doublings of Fibroblasts in ACF media.


Hypothesis


That ACF media will support 10+ doublings of fibroblasts.


Technical Gap


We have not previously attempted to grow fibroblasts in 10C ACF media.


Method/Procedure


Experimental Plan

  1. D0: Thaw 1M of F_DOLLY12 and seed 4x T25 flasks at 150,000 per flask in DMEM/F12+10%FBS+1xP/S
  2. D0: Make up 25 mL of 10C medium 
  3. D1: Perform 100% feed of:
    1.  2 x T25s with 10C medium
    2.  2 x T25s with DMEM/F12+10%FBS+1xP/S medium 
  4. D4: Passage 4 and count 4x T25 flasks into 4 x T25 flasks
  5. Serially passage and feed when necessary until cells senesce or stop proliferating.
