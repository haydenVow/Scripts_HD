Process
  
  
  1. Took 2 x 50 uL aliquots from e-flask culture and performed 2 x cell counts. 
    * Average cell count was: 35,173,333
  2. Transferred 1.8 mL culture to 1 x 50 mL tube
  3. Centrifuged at 500 x g for 5 minutes
  4. Aspirated 100% of supernatant
  5. Re-suspended in 6 mL of sterile dPBS (want 10,000 cells per well, so need 50,000 cells per mL in enough volume to seed all wells)
  6. Set up OT2 deck with media-filled plates and cell suspension 
  7.   

  8.  ~~Ran cell seeding protocol on OT2  ~~
    1.  ~~ ~~Start time:~~~~
    2.  ~~Run time:~~
      * Note: Observed that OT2 was not releasing droplets of cells - surface tension was too high. Stopped protocol and performed seeding manually with multi-channel pipette. 
  9. Imaged plates on Zaber microscope (phase, 5X) and ran through ML model. Checked that wells received cells. 
    * Note: all wells containing ethanolamine (either level) were very dense and we could not see through them. Seems to be too-high concentration, will need to investigate. 
  10. Moved plates to incubator at 37'C, 5%CO2 (incubator #119, main/library/production lab)
