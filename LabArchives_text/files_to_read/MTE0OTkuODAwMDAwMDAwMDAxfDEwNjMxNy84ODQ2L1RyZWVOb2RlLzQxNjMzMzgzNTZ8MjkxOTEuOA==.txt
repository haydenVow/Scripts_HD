Process:

  1. Aliquotted  200 mL  mL of  GM listed in table above. 
  2. Placed in water bath for 10 minutes minimum
  3. Take 1-2x images of the entire plate.  
    1. Notes for image taking and observations: 
      1. Orientate the plate so well A1 (indicated with permanent marker) is positioned in the top left corner. 
      2. Take a clear image of the plate using the lab-iPad positioned vertically above the plate to ensure you have a clear view of the tissue structures in each well. This will ensure we can efficiently compare the changes in the tissue formation between each feed. You can take it outside the hood (placed on top of a black surface) and i-pad. 
      3. Please copy the image of the plate under the 'Relevant Images' section below, ensuring the well A1 is positioned in the top left side of the image.
  4. Removed   100% of supernatant from vessel and placed waste media in a -80C freezer for future analysis
    1. Be wary of spills! these plates are very full (~180-200mL per plate). Clean up an growth media spills as soon as it is safe and reasonable to do so. 
  5. Replaced with  190 mL (per well/per vessel) of  growth media (listed above) 
  6. Returned vessel to incubate  14:30

### Observations/Summary:

 100 % media changed on vessel(s) ~144 hours (6 days) after seeding culture
12750

  1. 2x Images taken of the entire plate for qualtitative analysis of tissue formation.
