### Process:

  1. Took image of vessel on Zaber on phase setting.
  2. Aliquotted 22 mL of growth media and left it at room temperature while preparing OT2 deck.  

  3. Prepared a 384 wp with PBS and tryple as shown in the image. 50uL/well of PBS was added to the left half of the plate and 40uL/well tryple was added to the right half of the plate. 
    1.   4. Added 200uL/well of growth media (that was room temperature) to a 96 well plate.
  5. Uploaded the attached protocol and set up the OT2 deck as shown below. Note: this protocol passages wells A1 to P6 of the 384 wp.
    1. 



  1. Removed 384wp from the incubator    14:50  and placed in OT2 in position 7
  2. Calibrated OT2 and started run 14:58
    1. Run time: 02:17:08
  3. 96 well plate placed in the Thermo incubator at: 17:22 
    * [X]  37ÂºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)




Observations/Summary:

Passaged wells A1 to P6 of a 384 wp to a 96 wp using OT2.

Bubbles at the end of the pipette tip were observed which were not seen in
water runs. This was probably due to the protein in growth media. Avoiding
blowout, or pre-wetting the tip, or aspirating a higher volume, or dispensing
faster will be tested to prevent this.

Future protocol changes will also include the use of a Thermo 96 wp rather
than Corning as Thermo plates will be available more going forward.

There were many cells left in the 384 wp (compared to what I've observed when
doing this process manually). I would like to try aspirating a higher volume
at the final step to ensure we can collect all the cell suspension before
transferring it to the 96 wp.
