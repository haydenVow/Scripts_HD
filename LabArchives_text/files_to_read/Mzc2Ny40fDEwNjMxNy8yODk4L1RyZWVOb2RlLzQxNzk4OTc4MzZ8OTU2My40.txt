DMEM + 10% FBS + 1xP/SMix #591425 mL  
D/F + 5% FBS + 1:100 ACA + 1xP/SMix #6113

D/F + 10% FBS + 1xP/SAliquot #588510 mL  
  
  




Process:

  1. Aliquoted:
    1.  26 mL  of  DMEM + 10% FBS + 1xP/S  
    2. 11 mL of D/F + 10% FBS + 1xP/S 
    3. 11 mL of D/F + 5% FBS + 1:100 ACA + 1xP/S  
Placed in water bath: 11:35

  2. Paused shakers by pressing the "play" button on the controller on the side wall of the incubator
  3. Collected culture vessels from shakers, wiped with ethanol-sprayed cloth and brought into BSC 
    * Observation: Some visible fibroblast aggregates in E125 flask for first time - appear wispy and not very dense. Very large fibroblast clump (dense, ball-shaped) at bottom of both spin-tubes (see images at bottom of lab book entry)
  4. Using a 5 mL serelogical pipette, gently pipette-mixed cultures for 1 minute to break up cell clumps
  5. Pipetted suspensions though 70 um cell strainer into 3 x 50 mL tubes
  6. Centrifuged at 300 x g for 5 min. Timestamp: 12:17 - 12:22
  7. Aspirated supernatants, taking care to not disrupt or aspirate pellet 
  8. Re-suspended pellets in 500 uL growth media
  9. Took 2 x 10 uL aliquots from each cell suspension
  10. Performed cell counts and recorded in cell-count spreadsheet: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1YuTvXJXQQMIMwRZGeqNjdi20WeURg5FpM-1TJ-zrb1c/edit#gid=1104649984
    * Count (E125 flask): 206,400
    * Count (7415): 182,600
    * Count (7417): 110,000
  11. Replaced with fresh, warmed media
  12. Gently pipette-mixed culture again before moving back to E125 flask and 2 x spin tubes
  13. Returned vessels to incubator and replaced in clamp. Pressed "play" at side of incubators. Timestamp: 12:58

  * Incubator (#68 & #67), Lab [Main/Library/Production]
