Aim/Purpose: Adapt cells to suspension using the hanging drop cell culture method
Hypothesis: We hypothesise that the hanging drop cell culture method will not allow cells to adapt to suspension.
Technical Gap: We have never tried using the hanging drop cell culture method at Vow.
Method/Procedure


1\. Day 1: Spend some time playing with the hanging drop cell culture
technique to understand the technicalities of forming droplets which hang on
the roof of a cell culture plate. Assess microscopy capabilities.  
  
2\. Day 1: Thaw 1 x vial of DOLLY12 WCB cells. Spin down the tube and remove
the DMSO before re-suspending in DMEM/F12 + 10%FBS + 1:100 anti-clumping
agent. Take droplets of the cells and place them in hanging drop cell culture
formation.  
  
3\. Day 2, 3, 4: Monitor the cells daily. If the cells are proliferating
extensively in suspension, we will move them to a larger culture vessel.
