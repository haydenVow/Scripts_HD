Protocol


  

  1. 1 scaffold per condition removed and added to 24 WP for imaging. 3 times at 4x and 10 magnification each.
  2. 7 mLs removed from each well using a pipette.
  3. 7 mLs of fresh RPMI/HyCell 50:50  OR DMEM/F12 + 20% FBS added to each well with a serological pipette.
  4. Incubated.

Observations


Media seems to have been used a fair bit, will need to monitor the metabolic
load. Crosslinked gels seem to have relaxed a bit and enlarged in shape. Some
white precipitate is seen, it looks to be dissolved alginate recrosslinking.

Images not taken, so as to let the gels settle.
