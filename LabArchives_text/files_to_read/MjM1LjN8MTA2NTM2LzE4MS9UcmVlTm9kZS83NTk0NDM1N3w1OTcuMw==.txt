Batch Overview

Batch Goals:

  * Optimisation: Improve upon previous experimental findings and continue to find new ways to increase batch yield in adherent cultures 

Experimental Questions:

  1. Do cells take longer to peel/aggregate during extended VitC treatment in Thermo/Nunc 10CF or Corning 10CS?
    1. Can we replicate the yield increase previously produced with extended VitC treatment (Batch 14)?
  2. Can we produce greater yields in E-Flasks?
    1. Is the previously observed (Batch 14) loss in cell yield due to the E-flask environment/seeding or the treatment?
    2. Does VitC alone produce greater yields in E-Flasks?
  3. Can we produce greater yields in Roller bottles?
    1. Do the cells stick down effective with our current roller apparatus settings?
    2. Do cells peel off at the same rate as 10CS/CF in Roller bottles after extended VitC treatment?

Reasons for Investigating these Questions:

  1. In previous experiment (Batch 14) the experiment needed to be cut short because the aggregate sheets started to peel off the flasks. We wanted to investigate if there is a significant difference in adhesion time between the two brands of flasks to see if we should be using one over the other at the final/P4 stage.
  2. In the previous batch (14) we found that aggregates could form in static E-flasks treated with VitC (50ug/mL) + TGFb (10ng/mL) for 24hrs. The purpose of these experiments is to optimise this further and see if it is a viable option for P5 of future batches.The previous batch (14) did not have a control condition so it was not clear if the observed loss in cell yield was a result of the E-Flask environment/seeding or the treatment itself. We have added a control to this experiment to determine this. We also didn't previously test VitC alone so will be doing that this time.
  3. Roller bottles may allow us to further increase our cell yield and give us easy access to remove the biomass. We need to first establish the ideal conditions/setting for roller bottles and determine if our usual treatments behave the same in this flask. It is possible that the circular, continuous growth surface will allow the cells to stay adhered for longer during the Vitamin C treatment phase, thus allowing a greater yield to be reached.

Experimental Deviations:

Original Plan

Amended Plan  
  
Earlier harvesting: 10CF (Thermo/Nunc) flasks were harvested earlier than
anticipated due to peeling/aggregation formation in both the VItC treated and
control flasks.  
  
Extended incubation time for Bottles A and B: Due to a lack of peeling, the
incubation time of Bottles A and B were extended, at D9 post treatment still
no peeling was observed but bottles were harvested anyway in order to acquire
results and plan new experiments.

Conclusions/Answers to Experimental Questions:

1\. Do cells take longer to peel/aggregate during extended VitC treatment in
Thermo/Nunc 10CF or Corning 10CS?

Cells take longer to peel/aggregate in the 10CS (Corning). The VitC treated
10CF showed signs of peeling/aggregation at 48hrs after treatment at which
time the VitC treated 10CS showed no signs of peeling/aggregation. This
occurred between days 4 and 5 in VitC treated 10CS, an extra 48-72hrs after
the 10CF (Thermo/Nunc)

  1. Can we replicate the yield increase previously produced with extended VitC treatment (Batch 14)?

Yes. In the 10CS (Corning) we were able to produce double the biomass compared
to the control therefore replicating the results of Batch 14. There was also a
slight increase in biomass with the 10CF (Thermo/Nunc) but this was much
smaller. In future, when VitC treating in multi-layered flasks, 10CS should be
used not 10CF.

  

E-Flasks:

Individual cell weight calculated in this experiment:

From 6x10CS/CF Harvest:

  * 2,126,580,000 cells were harvested
  * with a weight of 10.624g

Therefore the weight of one cell is: 10.624g / 2,126,580,000 cells = 4.996ng

Each E-flask was seeded with 232,036,667 cells, therefore the weight put into
each E-Flask was: 4.99ng * 232,036,667 =  1.159g

Conclusions/Answers to Experimental Questions:

2\. Can we produce greater yields in E-Flasks?

In this experiment cells did not aggregate like seen in Batch 14. There were
two main differences between the experiments that may have contributed to this
result. The concentration of cells were significantly higher in this
experiment (3.5Mcells/mL in Batch 14 compared to 10.5Mcells/mL in this
experiment), the shape of the flask base was also different (E250 are flat,
E125 have a baffled design *See picture below).

More optimisation experiments would be required to see if E-flasks could be of
benefit, however on our short time frame and the lack of obvious benefit
currently present, this option will not be investigated any further.



  1. Is the previously observed (Batch 14) loss in cell yield due to the E-flask environment/seeding or the treatment?

This is still unclear. The current experiment does not show the same loss as
seen in batch 14, however, there are still a number of factors that could be
influencing these changes and the answer to the question cannot be determined
without further investigation.

Conclusions/Answers to Experimental Questions:

3\. Can we produce greater yields in Roller bottles?

YES! in terms of g/cm2 Roller Bottle (B) produced a yield that was DOUBLE the
highest yield in 10CS. In addition, Roller Bottle (C) seeded in VitC produced
a very similar yield (g/cm2) to the highest produced in VitC treated 10CS.

        1\. Do the cells stick down effective with our current roller apparatus settings?

Yes cells in all conditions cells adhered and reached 100% confluence. Bottle
(A) and (B) never displayed any peeling/aggregation despite time in culture or
treatment condition.

        2\. Do cells peel off at the same rate as 10CS/CF in Roller bottles after extended VitC treatment?

This depends on the time of treatment:

  * In Roller Bottle (C) VitC Seeded, the cells stuck down for the same amount of time as seen in T175 flasks seeded with VitC (8 days) before peeling/aggregation was observed and produced a final yield (g/cm2) similar to the highest yield achieved in 10CS. 
  * However, Roller Bottle (B) treated with VitC @D7 lasted significantly longer than 10CS VitC treated flasks and even at 9 treatment days no peeling/aggregation was observed (10CS VitC treated flasks peel between 2-4 treatment days). This resulted in DOUBLE the yield (g/cm2) in the roller bottle compared to the highest pellet weight achieved in 10CS. 

Therefore despite having similar treatment lengths, the time at which this
treatment is applied is highly important for roller bottles yields and
treating later seems better than seeding in the treatment. It is also possible
that a higher yield may have been achieved if the cells were grown for longer
as no peeling was observed at the time of harvest. There was also no
aggregation in the Control Roller Bottle (A) this is in contrast to 5CS/10CF
which have shown aggregate formation after prolonged incubation time/very high
confluence.

  

Unanswered Questions:

  * Is the previously observed (Batch 14) loss in cell yield due to the E-flask environment/seeding or the treatment?

  

Overall Key Findings:

  * If VitC treating in multi-layered flasks 10CS should be used NOT 10CF
  * We can achieve 2x our highest yield in 10CS with Roller bottles!
    * VitC treatment time is important for this. Treating later is better than seeding with VitC

Batch Achievements:

  * Increased the yield 2x AGAIN! We are now able to produce 4x our maximum yield at the start of Q3.
  * Effectively used roller bottles for the first time 
  * Identified an important difference between different brands of 10-layered flasks
