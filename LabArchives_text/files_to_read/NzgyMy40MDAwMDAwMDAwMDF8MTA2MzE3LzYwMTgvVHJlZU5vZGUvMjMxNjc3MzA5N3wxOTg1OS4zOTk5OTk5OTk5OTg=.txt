AIM/PURPOSE: In the possible event of slowed growth, this expansion with act
as a back-up for CHOMP09 MCB to WCB1 expansion. See lab book here: https://au-
mynotebook.labarchives.com/share/Vow%2520-%2520Team%2520Science/NzY2Ni4xfDEwNjMxNy81ODk3LTQ4ODgwL1RyZWVOb2RlLzEyMzAwNDc1OTN8MTk0NjAuMQ==

Production require a WCB of >300M cells as soon as possible, and this
expansion was commenced in order to protect against time losses if our
original expansion in able to reach this target number of cells.  

HYPOTHESIS:  Continued culture of an initial population of 1M F_CHOMP09 MCB
cells will allow for a bank of  â‰¥ 400M cells within 4 passages.

RESULTS SUMMARY: This culture was terminated after 2 passages as the CHOMP09
WCB1 expansion produced sufficient cells and it was no longer required and
incubator space was limited.
