Aim/Purpose


Background

Using the foundations built up during the "Buffalo Wings" prototype work, we
will trial tissue engineering at larger scales and using suspension adapted
cells (Nuvonis fibroblasts predominantly). This work is part of the Mini-
Tissues workstream for the Second Product, more can be read about this here.
Initial Buffalo Wings experimental plans and lab books can be found here.

Currently we are utilising a tissue gel matrix that contains Matrigel.
Matrigel is a expensive component that makes scale up of this project
challenging and thus needs to be removed or replaced in a way that does not
diminish the self-assembly processes that enable the complex 3D tissue
structure to form.

Aim

To determine the minimal ratios of Matrigel and Collagen needed to create
complex 3D tissue structure during maturation.

Hypothesis

Tissue-engineered tissues will maintain structural and textural complexity
during the maturation period at a lower ratio of Matrigel in the gel matrix.


Methods and Experiment Layout


Brief Method

The method followed here will be very similar to the one used for the Buffalo
Wings prototype large scale harvest. Briefly, this method will use Nuvonis
cells, embedded in a tissue gel matrix consisting of defined ratios of:
Collagen I, 10x DMEM/F12, 0.1M Sodium Hydroxide and Matrigel. This allows the
formation of tissues via the process of tissue gelation, condensation and
self-assembly around 2 attachment points (Figure 1) - See Notion page for
summary of approach.

printed solid mould (white)

Experiment Layout

We will seed 1 plates (include plate dimensions here) containing tissue
engineering moulds with 12 tissues, at a single cell density (5M cells per
mL), and we will mature the tissues for XXXX days).

Before Starting

  * Calculate approximate cell requirements for experiment 3 
    * 12 tissues = 9 million cells for 1 plate (12 wells) at the 5M/mL (each well has a volume of 0.15mL with 0.75 Million cells per well)
    * 3 tissues = 2.25 million cells 
    * 1 tissue = 0.75 million cells
