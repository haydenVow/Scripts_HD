Aim/Purpose


Pilot run of seed train workflow for mass-generation of cell mass in house
using Biostat RM (Sartorius) rocking motion bag


Hypothesis


N/A (see above)


Technical Gap


Vow has not before operated bioreactors >2L benchtop scale. Similarly,
suspension-adapted Nuvonis cell line (Baxter) have not yet before been
cultured in a larger bioreactor vessel. This pilot run will aim to test the
mass-production of cell mass with a workflow using infrastructure available
in-house at Vow using a suspension adapted cell line.


Method/Procedure


  1. Prepare 20L Nuvonis suspension medium
  2. Ensure health of seed train (see EPIC 30919 for details)
  3. Harvest cells from 3L Mobius reactor once cells have reached a total number of 2B cells by peristalsis pumping (Sartorius controller to harvest into prepared, autoclaved and sterile 2L bottle)
  4. Use peristalsis pump (Sartorius controller) to add 20L into 50L Flex-safe bag
  5. Use peristalsis pump (Sartorius controller) to seed cell harvest from Mobius 3L unit into sterile bottle.
  6. Clamp and seal all tubing in sterile manner
  7. Transport bag using trolley to RM platform (outside of Lab in warehouse) and attach bag to controller
  8. Use bioprocess calculator to determine agitation force in 3L unit and calculate for RM platform - adjust controller settings to meet these requirements
  9. Harvest following 5 days in culture
