Process:

1\. (24-June-21) Aliquotted   2mL  mL of  both E6 and HS diff media into
separate 15mL   tube(s). Labelled tube lids with 'SAT' as well as the date and
media type on the side of the tube. Placed tubes in the bottom bar fridge in
the library lab (fridge 104)  
  
1.5. Removed both 'SAT' aliquots from the fridge and placed them in the water
bath 10:30 am  

2\. Removed   100 % of supernatant wells B2-B4 and C2-C4 on each 96 well
plate.

3\. Added E6 diff media (200uL) to Wells B2-B4 on each plate and Horse serum
diff media to wells C2-C4 on each plate. Left wells D2-D4 untouched.

4\. Returned vessel to incubate at:   11:31 am  

  * [x]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (aviary cells)

  

  * Incubator (#78, Library Lab).
