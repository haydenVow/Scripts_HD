Experimental Plan:

[DAY 1] Thaw DOLLY12 Fibroblasts

[DAY 2] 50% Feed

[DAY 5] Prepare Zein scaffolds if necessary. Passage DOLLY12 Fibroblasts and
seed the amount required onto adherent culture and Zein scaffolds (0.3-0.5M
scaffold and adherent condition except negative controls)

Note* Days 1-5 are in the experimental plan for EPIC 17450 so this experiment
is initially piggy backing off that EPIC.

[DAY 7] Observe cells for confluency. If confluent proceed with staining all
samples with 4% Paraformaldehyde, parafilm and store at 4'C until ready to
proceed with immunofluorescence staining. If not perform a 50% feed and
observe the next day.

[DAY 8] If samples are fixed perform the primary staining for the TE-7 and
Vimentin with independent antibody only and leave at 4'C overnight.
