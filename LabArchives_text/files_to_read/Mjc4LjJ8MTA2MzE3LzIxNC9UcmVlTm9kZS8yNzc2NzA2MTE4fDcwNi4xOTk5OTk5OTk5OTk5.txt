AIM/PURPOSE: To explore the properties of the fibroblasts with respect to
aggregation.

HYPOTHESIS: That fibroblasts will form aggregates when treated with TGBb and
Vit C under conditions of shaking.

RESULTS SUMMARY: After 24h of treatment with 50ug/mL Vit C and 10ng/mL TGFb on
a shaking platform, macroscopic aggregates of fibroblasts appeared floating in
the T175. These aggregates were prepared & assessed by the food science team.

CONCLUSIONS: This method of forming aggregates is very successful and should
be pursued further.

NEXT STEPS: Assess different concentrations of Vit C and TGFb to determine the
optimal conditions to deploy into production.

  

  

Experimental Plan:

Day 1 - [TUESDAY] Revive Fibroblast cells

Day 2 - [WEDNESDAY] 50% Feed Fibroblast cells

Day 4 - [FRIDAY] Passage Fibroblasts

Day 7 - [MONDAY] Feed/Monitor Fibroblasts

Day 9 - [WEDNESDAY] Passage Fibroblasts to a high density (250,000 cells per
cm2, or 44 million per T175).  
  
Day 10 - [THURSDAY] 100% feed with media containing 50ug/mL Vitamin C (aka
ascorbic acid) and 10ng/mL TGF. Place the T175 on a shaker flask. If another
experiment is ongoing, use whatever speed the shaker is already set at.
Otherwise, use 100rpm.

Day 11 [FRIDAY] Monitor cells for aggregation (clumps). Image if present.  
  
Day 11 [FRIDAY] Harvest cell clumps and weigh them. Get a cell count if
possible.
