RELATED TO MILESTONE:  PPP_Q4_KR2_Characterise 2 x QMS-compliant suspension-
adapted fibroblast clones from our chosen species

AIM/PURPOSE:  
1\. To confirm the DOLLY12 fibroblasts in the CD CHO basal medium can adapt to
suspension  
2\. To determine if CD CHO basal media can be used to adapt CHOMP09
fibroblasts to suspension

HYPOTHESIS: That DOLLY12 fibroblasts will adapt to suspension in CD CHO basal
medium conditions as shown by previous experiments

RESULTS SUMMARY:  
  
  
  
  

CONCLUSIONS:  
We were unable to generate a successful suspension adapted line of DOLLY12 or
CHOMP09 using the current conditions. CD CHO basal media + ACF outperformed
the D/F + FBS negative control. For both cell types, higher cell counts were
achieved with manual fed E125 flasks in comparison to the automatically fed
50mL shake tubes, suggesting they are more well-suited for suspension
adaptation workflows.

NEXT STEPS:  
- E125 flasks should be used for future suspension adaptation workflows  
\- Further investigation into the cell population decline between day 10 to
day 20 (AKA the "Valley of Death") and how it can be prevented may be crucial
for the generation of a suspension adapted cell line  
\- Further investigation into why 50mL shake tubes cultures failed in order to
optimise automated workflows and enable high throughput suspension adaptation
experiments
