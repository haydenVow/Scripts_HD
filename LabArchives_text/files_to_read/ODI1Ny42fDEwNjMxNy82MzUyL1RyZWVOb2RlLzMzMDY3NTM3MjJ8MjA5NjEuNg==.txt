### Process:

1\. Aliquotted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then
placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath for a minimum of 20 minutes
prior to use:

  1. TrypLE:      20   mL in    1     tubes   

  2.  dPBS (for neutralising):    20    mL
  3.  dPBS (for washing):     20   mL
  4. Growth media (for pellet resuspension):      4   mL
  5. Growth media (for seeding):  600 mL 

Time that all aliquots were placed in the water bath the warm before use    13
: 48

Note: if aliquots were placed in water bath at different time, record the time
stamp for each individual solution.




4\. Removed vessel(s) from the incubator   13:59  am

5\. Washed the vessel(s) with dPBS (warmed).

6\. Added      10   mL tryple to each vessel/well and incubated at 37˚C.

  1. Start/Finish for TrypLE was    14:15 - 14:29   

7\. Neutralised with     10     dPBS and combined cell suspension into a  50ml
tube.

8\. Centrifuged at 650 x g for 5 min.

  1. Start/Finish time for centrifugation was  14:45 - 14:50   




9\. Aspirated the supernatant(s).

10\. Resuspended pellet(s) in   15 mL     Growth     media   15:10  

11\. Aliquoted  10ul   of resuspended cells into a microcentrifuge tube for
cell count.

12\. Performed a cell count using the haemocytometer and recorded the cell
count data in the Google Doc spreadsheet: Cell Count Spreadsheet or cell count
widget below. Cell count added to doublings calculator to track the doublings
time in days

  1. Total cell number was:     11,160,000   

  2. Volume of cell suspension required for subculture was:      15mL      

  3. Cell density per vessel:     7000/cm2      




13\. Transferred    15 ml of cell suspension to the pre-warmed  600 mL Growth
media: 15:26

14\. Transferred cell suspension into the      2x 4CF     vessel.

16\. Transferred vessel(s) to incubate at: 15:55

  * [ X]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (avian cells)
