Procedure




Observation:

  * Cells were very clumpy/aggregated in the 6-well-plates.
  * Normally these aggregates would be much smaller and look more like a haze in the media than solid aggregates
  * The aggregates broke up a bit when resuspended with the serological
  * When cell suspension was added to E500 there were still visible aggregates floating around.




Cell count was extremely low with dilution so second count was taken from the
same cell suspension aliquot and counted without being diluted.
