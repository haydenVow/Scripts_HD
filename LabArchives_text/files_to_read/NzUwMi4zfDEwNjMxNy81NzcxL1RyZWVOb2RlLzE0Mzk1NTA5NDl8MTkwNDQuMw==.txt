### Process:

1\. Took image of vessel with microscope on phase setting.

2\. Aliquotted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then
placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath for a minimum of 20 minutes
prior to use:

  1. TrypLE:   630  mL 
  2.  dPBS (for washing & neutralising):   1260  mL
  3. Growth medium (for pellet resuspension):   30  mL
    * GM: D/F+20%FBS+1xP/S 
  4. Growth media conditions (for seeding):   7 x 60 mL aliquots, 1 x 80 mL aliquot (1 x aliquot/condition)  

Time that all aliquots were placed in the water bath the warm before use  

Note: if aliquots were placed in water bath at different time, record the time
stamp for each individual solution.




4\. Removed vessel(s) from the incubator

5\. Collected supernatant in sterile 2L bottle.

6\. Washed the vessel(s) with dPBS (warmed). Collected dPBS in sterile 500 mL
bottle.  

8\. Added  200 & 10  mL TrypLE/flask and incubated at 37˚C.

  1. Start/Finish for TrypLE was  9:30 - 9:39, 9:56 - 10:06     

9\. While flasks were tryplising, split 2.4L of collected supernatant + dPBS
into 10 x 250 mL tubes and centrifuged at 800 xg for 5 min 9:36 - 9:41,
9:48-9:53, 9:54-9:59, 10:01 - 10:06, 10:09 - 10:14  

  1. Poured off supernatant, leaving ~20 mL on pellet. Resuspended and moved into 6 x 50 mL tubes.   

  2. Centrifuged at 800 x g for 5 min 10:18 - 10:23  

  3. Aspirated supernatant off pellet and resuspended in 25 mL dPBS  

  4. Centrifuged at 800 x g for 5 min 10:28 - 10:33  

  5. Aspirated supernatant off pellet and resuspended in 20 mL Tryple. Incubated for 15 min (observe for cells sheets to have broken up more). 10:38 -   

  6. Strained cell suspension using a 40 um cell strainer to remove large clumps that hadn't broken up in Tryple. Added 20 mL dPBS to neutralise.   

  7. Centrifuged at 800 x g for 5 min
  8. Aspirated supernatant off pellet and resuspended in growth medium. Combined with cell suspension from 4CFs.   

10\. Neutralised flasks with   200 mL   dPBS/flask and combined cell
suspension into   6 x 250 mL  tubes.

11\. Centrifuged neutralised cells at 650 x g for 5 min.

  1. Start/Finish time for centrifugation was
    1.  11:12 - 11:17 (cells did not pellet properly,so increased G to 800 and re-spun) 11:19 - 11:24    

    2.   11:28 - 11:33    

12\. Centrifuged at 650 x g for 5 min.

  1. Start/Finish time for centrifugation was    9:54-9:59     




13\. Aspirated the supernatant(s).

14\. Re-suspended pellet(s) in:

  1. Mutagenesis cells:   2  mL   growth   medium
  2. 4CF: 46 mL growth medium  

15\. Aliquotted    100 ul of resuspended cells into a microcentrifuge tube for
cell count. Diluted to 1:10 in trypan blue.  

16\. Performed a cell count using the haemocytometer and recorded the cell
count data in the Google Doc spreadsheet:

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1DPzKubYxfHmWogVPihC-
SSIBtIylyrBQE5kRX5Z8NtI/edit#gid=0

  1. Total cell number was:     221 260 000     

  2. Volume of  cell suspension required for subculture was:   1.91 mL / flask     

  3. Cell density per vessel:   18M / flask, 0.9M / mL   




13\. Transferred  5740 µL of cell suspension to each pre-warmed  60  mL Growth
media aliquot  

14\. Transferred  of each aliquot into E-125 flasks (3 reps of ~~7~~ 4
conditions = ~~21~~ 12 total E-125 flasks)

15\. Took 1 x 100 uL aliquot from each E-125 flask and transferred to 2 x
96-well plate for staining & cell count (see "staining" rich text entry below)

15\. Transferred E-125s to shaking platform (120 RPM) to incubate at:  

  * [ ]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (avian cells)
  * [x]  30ºC, 5% CO2 (reptilian cells)




Staining

Prepared dead stain solution in amber/black centrifuge tube:  
\- 4 mL dPBS  
\- 4 drops Nucgreen AF488 dead stain  
\- Vortex for 5 seconds to mix

Prepared Hoechst stain (50 ug/mL) solution in amber/black centrifuge tube:  
\- 9500 uL MilliQ  
\- 500 uL Hoechst Trihydrochloride trihydrate (1mg/mL)  
\- Vortex for 5 seconds to mix. Solution can be stored at 4°C for up to 6
months

  1. Added 20 uL of Hoechst stain directly to cells
  2. Added 80 uL of dead stain solution (dPBS+Nucgreen) to cells
  3. Incubated for 30 minutes in the dark at room temperature 12:59 - 12:27
  4. Made 4x and 8x dilutions of the sample in dPBS 
  5. Centrifuged plates at 300 RCF for 1 minute 12:29 - 12:30  
  

  6. Prepared plate map:  
\- Created a new "MIA output" data workbook by copying the template at the

Observations/Summary:

  * 13-Dec-2021: x3 Flasks showed extremely high turbidity (by eye) and distinct contaminated smell:
    * 9607: HyCell CHO Control
    * 9612: CD CHO Control
    * 9617: CD CHO + p53i
  * Discarded straight into biological waste and removed waste bag from lab immediately
  * incubator and platform decontaminated
  * flasks returned to incubator

  

  * >5 flasks from this experiment looked very cloudy. No colour change or contaminated smell. Wanted to elimated suspected contamination
  * took 9610: HyCell CHO +p53i into anteroom with 6-well plate. Poured sample of culture into plate and discarded culture. Decontaminated multi-well plate and imaged sample
  * see images below:
  * https://mia-capture.vow.tools/#/session/recCT1rFLtyYKdRiy/images 
  * cells appear stressed. No apparent contamination at least by eye  

  * monitor all flasks in incubator carefully over next week
