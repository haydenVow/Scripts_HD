N=60 of each Zein and Gelain Gelatex scaffolds pieces were previously prepared
and placed into glass dishes (see lab book entry).

Heat sterilisation.

1\. Temperature probe was placed into the oven for heat monitoring.

2\. 11:50 Oven initially set to 130 degrees Celsius. For the first 10 minutes,
the heat fluctuated widely. After 5 minutes, the oven shot up to 190 degrees
and was turned off temporarily to allow it to cool.  
3\. Oven was turned on again and set to 130'C 12:00

4\. Temperatures stabilised at 140'C by  12:10  
5\. Scaffold pieces were placed into the toaster oven within glass petri
dishes. After this the temperature was checked every 10-20minutes over the
next 2 hours.  
6. The temperature remained between 145-160 degrees over the course of the 2 hour sterilisation period.  
5\. After 2 hours, the oven was turned off and allowed to cool prior to
plating the scaffolds for later seeding 14:10
