Procedure
  
  
Inspected the components

  1. Checked any "wetted" materials (materials that come into contact with the culture or additives and are therefore required to maintain sterility) for damage or residues that may introduce contamination (examples include seals and tubing).
  2. Checked any potentially dangerous equipment (e.g. gas regulators, gas lines, pressure release valves) for abnormalities that may lead to an accident.

Autoclaved the vessel

  1. Transported the vessel and bottles to the autoclave using a trolley.
  2. Placed the vessel and bottles into the autoclave chamber.
