Process

  1. Collected 4 x 24-well plates wrapped in foil labelled "LL SUN FEED" from bottom draw of "media & gelatin" fridge (these contain fresh media) 
  2. Unwrapped foil and removed parafilm from plates (can be done outside BSC just be careful to not lift lids)
  3. Placed 4 x 24-well plates in incubator for at least 20 minutes. Timestamp:  14:24
  4. Transferred 4 x 24-well plates (with warmed media) and 4 x culture plates (4 x 24-well plates) from Thermo incubator to BSC.
  5. Using a well ethanol-sprayed hand, picked up HTS well insert tray of plate labelled BLOCK 1 by the edge and transferred to the corresponding BLOCK 1 media plate. Ensure the media plate is facing the correct way (i.e. with A1 at the top left-hand side). Use the lid from the culture plate for the new plate (to avoid having to re-print a culture label). 
  6. Repeated for BLOCKS 2-4. 
  7. Returned 4 x culture plates to the Thermo Incubator (15:34) and discarded old plates with spent media.  MAKE SURE LIDS WITH BLOCK 1-4 LABEL REMAIN ON PLATES OR ARE RE-LABELLED.
