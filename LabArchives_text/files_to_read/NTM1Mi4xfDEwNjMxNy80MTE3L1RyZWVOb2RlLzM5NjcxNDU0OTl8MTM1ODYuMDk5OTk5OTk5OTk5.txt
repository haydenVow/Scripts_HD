### Process:  

For Passage: Heat the following to 30C in the water bath

  1. TrypLE:     5  mL in      1   tubes
  2.  dPBS (for neutralising):   5 mL
  3.  dPBS (for washing):     5 mL
  4. DMEM + 20% FBS + 1 x PS for pellet resuspension):     1  mL
  5. DMEM + 20% FBS + 1 x PS  for seeding    30   

Time that all aliquots were placed in the water bath the warmed to 30C before
use  16:12  

Note: if aliquots were placed in water bath at different time, record the time
stamp for each individual solution.




Passage  

  1.  Removed vessel(s) from the incubator   16:45  

  2. Washed the vessel(s) with dPBS (warmed).
  3. Added 5mL  tryple to each vessel/well and incubated at 30ËšC.
  4. Start/Finish for TrypLE was     16:47-16:52  

  5. Neutralised each with with   dPBS (equal to volume of tryple) and transferred to  15mL    tube.
  6. Centrifuged at 650 x g for 5 min.
  7. Start/Finish time for centrifugation was  17:00-17:05  

  8. Aspirated the supernatant(s).
  9. Resuspended pellet(s) in   mL   3  media
  10.  Aliquoted   20uL  of resuspended cells into a microcentrifuge tube for cell count.
  11. Performed a cell count using the haemocytometer and recorded the cell count data in the Google Doc spreadsheet called 'Cell Count Spreadsheet' (see link below):

SSIBtIylyrBQE5kRX5Z8NtI/edit#gid=0  

    1. Total cell count was : 1,980,000
    2. Re-seeded approximately cells into 2x T175 flasks, giving a seeding density of 5657/cm
    3.  Incubate at 30C and 5% CO2. Library lab #77
