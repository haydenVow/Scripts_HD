### Process:

1\. Took image of vessel with microscope on phase setting.

2\. Collect a pre-Gelatin coated     1     x    T75      flask that was stored
in the fridge, parafilmed.

  1. Time when flask was placed into the incubator     9:35 am 

3\. Aliquotted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then
placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath for a minimum of 20 minutes
prior to use:

  1. TrypLE:     5    mL in     1    tubes
  2.  dPBS (for neutralising):    5    mL
  3.  dPBS (for washing):     5    mL
  4. Growth media (for seeding):    12   mL 

Time that all aliquots were placed in the water bath the warm before use
9:38  am

Note: if aliquots were placed in water bath at different time, record the time
stamp for each individual solution.




4\. Removed vessel(s) from the incubator   10:06 am

5\. Washed the vessel(s) with dPBS (warmed).

6\. Added   5  mL tryple to each vessel/well and incubated at 37˚C.

  1. Start/Finish for TrypLE was   10:10 - 10:21 am 

7\. Neutralised with   5   dPBS and combined cell suspension into a    1 X
15mL   tube.

8\. Centrifuged at 650 x g for 5 min.

  1. Start/Finish time for centrifugation was   10:23 - 12:28 am 




9\. Aspirated the supernatant(s).

10\. Resuspended pellet(s) in   12  mL   Growth (incl 10uM p38i)   media
10:25 am

11\. Transferred cell suspension into 1 x un-coated T75 flask. Leave at 37C in
incubator for 45 mins   10:33 - 11:18 am  

12\. After 45 minutes, transfer supernatant into 1 x gelatin-coated T75 flask.
Allow to sit at RT for 30 mins to allow cells to settle   11:22 - 11:52 am  




13\. Transferred vessel(s) to incubate at:

  * [ X ]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (avian cells)




Observations/Summary:

KUZCO20 MuSCs successfully pre-plated in 1 x non-coated T75 flask and then
transferred into 1 x gelatin-coated T75 flask.
