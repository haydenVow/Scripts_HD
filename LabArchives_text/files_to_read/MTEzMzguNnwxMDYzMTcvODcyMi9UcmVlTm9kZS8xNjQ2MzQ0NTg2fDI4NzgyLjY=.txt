Protocol


### Preparation (Things to complete before starting the seeding experiment):

  1. Make up a stock 10X solution of EPL and aliquot the required volume into alginate and gelatin to make up 4 concentrations of EPL in these coatings: 
    1. 0.1% 
    2. 0.005% 
    3. 0.0025% 
  2. Make up sterile-filter gelatin solution 
  3. Make up 2.5% alginate (medium MW) and autoclave. 
  4. 0.1% gelatin solution was used to coat   72 wells across  5   vessels, with 200uL per well.
    1. Flasks were then incubated at 37˚C for at least 1 hour.
      1. Time when flasks went into 37ºC incubator.     XX:XX  
  5. Coat plates with Alginate (200uL/well) 
    1. Crosslink for 15 minutes  XX:XX  
      1. Wash scaffolds in media at RT according to this:
        1. 1x 1 min wash
        2. 1x 5 min wash
        3. 1x 10 min wash at 37 C.  
  

  6. Aliquotted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath or bead bath for a minimum of 20 minutes prior to use:
    1. Growth media (for pellet resuspension):    72 mL
      1. Add growth factors if necessary according to the E8 calculator.
    2. Growth media (for seeding):     mL 
      1. Time that all aliquots were placed in the water bath the warm before use   XX:XX  
  

Note: if aliquots were placed in water bath at different time, record the time
stamp for each individual solution.  
  




## Cell Seeding Protocol - FOR PORK BUN GEL

  1. Perform cell count. Density for experiments: 16 million cells / mL.
    1. Cell Supply Culture ID: 
      1. Cell count (total): 
      2. Cell count (per mL): 
    2. Volume of cell suspension aliquoted for this experiment (7500cells/cm^2 across 6x24-WP; 14,250 cells/well) :
      1. 2,052,000 cells in __ mL cell suspension
  2. Passage cells. Put required cell volume into 50mL centrifuge tubes.
  3. Centrifuge cell suspension for 5 mins at 500g. 
    1. Start time: 
  4. Resuspend in 72mL (since 24x6x0.5) growth medium
  5. Pipette 500uL of cel suspension into each well. 
  6. Place in incubator (37C 5%CO2). 
    1. timestamp: 
  7. Initiate feed schedule outlined below. 

  

## Feeding Schedule

  1. Culture duration: in cell strainers for 7 days
  2. Daily 50% feeds. Remove 50% of the growth medium in each well/ scaffold (2mL) and replaced with new growth medium every day. 

## Monitoring and Stain Schedule

  1. Take 3 images at 5x and 3 images at 10x
  2. Check for signs of contamination.
  3. 2ug/mL (Hoechst 33342 /Propidium Iodide)
    1. Viability stain performed at day 1, 4 and 7 and if possible a metabolic assay on those days as well.
      1.  Day 1: 30 June 22
      2. Day 4: 3 July 22
      3. Day 7: 6 July 22
