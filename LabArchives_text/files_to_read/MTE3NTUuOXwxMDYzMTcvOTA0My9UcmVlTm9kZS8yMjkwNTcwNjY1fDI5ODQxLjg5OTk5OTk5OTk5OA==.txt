Methods and Experiment Layout


Experimental layout

We will attempt to seed four tissue discs. Each disc will be a single
replicate (condition). Conditions will be as follows:

  1. 0.2M NaOH used in gel matrix
  2. 0.4M NaOH used in gel matrix
  3. 0.6M NaOH used in gel matrix
  4. 1M NaOH used in gel matrix

All Conditions set to gel at 37C, 5%CO2 for 1.5 - 2.5 hours

  

Figure 1. Plate Map for Tissue Discs Experiment B, to determine the optimum
acidity levels of large scale tissue disc cultures. There are 4 conditions
(n=1) with the condition details outlined within the figure. All culture will
have a cell density of 40M cells/ml with a gel matrix volume of 25ml.

Cell Supply Harvest and Matrix Formation for Seeding


## Preparation for Harvest

  1. Prepare 4 falcon tubes for cell harvest for 4 conditions of different cell densities (20M and 40M cells/mL) and 2 different seeding volumes (20mL and 25mL).
    1. Completed calculations can be found here
  2. Media preparation for harvest and seeding: 
    1. DMEM/F12 growth medium as above (table 1).

  4. Pour required volume of cell suspension for 1 tissue disc into 500mL centrifuge tubes:
    * 1B cells in  \---  mL from #1232
  5. Centrifuge at 500g for 5 minutes (in 500mL centrifuge tubes) 
  6. Resuspend the pellet in 50mL of growth medium in a 50mL falcon tube and centrifuge at 300g for 5 minutes.  
  7. Resuspend pellets in each centrifuge tubes in    12.1 mL   DMEM/F12 growth medium TOTAL (first resuspend in 5mL to account for pellet volume to make up to a total of 12.1ml)
    * NOTE: Resuspending the pellet is very thick and viscous and takes up a high volume. 
  8.  ~~Add required volume of cells+media to 4 falcon tubes~~ :
  9. Proceed to matrix additions below. 
    1. Bring out matrix additives from the fridge only until ready to use. 
  10. Repeat step 4-8 for each tissue. 

## Matrix formation for scaffold seeding - 2 cell densities + 2 tissue gel
volumes

N.B. Repeat this gel formation for each falcon tube at the same time - i.e.
Add Collagen to all, then add DMEM to all etc. - BUT be sure to move quickly!
Refer to Figure 2 to visualise the workflow.

1. Remove pluronic from the wells.

5\. Seed gel/matrix gently into scaffold ensuring good distribution around
pillars in the well.

6. Leave for    60-90    minutes to gel at 37°C - start time 

Duration left to gel:

  * Condition 1 (Control): 3 hours 20 minutes
  * Condition 2 (Control gel matrix set at Ambient conditions): 3 hours 20 minutes
  * Condition 3: (Gel Matrix containing HEPES in cell+growth media suspension): 2 hours and 30 minutes
  * Condition 4: (Gel Matrix containing 0.2M NaOH solution): 2 hours and 30 minutes
  * Condition 5 (

Note (from Alex W 21/07/22): Add Growth media to the entire dish at or before
the 3 hour time point (post-seeding as the gel matrix environment begins to
become stressful and prohibitive for cell viability, especially when each
tissue disc has a high density (1B per disc at 40M cells/mL). Observing tissue
matrices which have not gelled is a valid result to be discussed in the
results section below.

7\. Add     ~180-200ml media to entire 15mL dish, ensure entire mould is
covered.  15:10 - 16:10  

8. Culture at 37°C overnight before checking.

workflow.

  




# Tips and Tricks for this protocol:

  * When pelleting cells, make sure they are completely dry
  * Flick pellet to dislodge before adding medium
  * Add Medium first to pellet to prevent clumping and cell death
  * Col1 is very viscous, pipette carefully - when adding 10x DMEM, it turns yellow
  * As soon as you add the NaOH, be quick as the Col starts to gel
  * Everything has to be exact, don't be tempted to add more cells than the volume stated if there are some left
  * Add cells slowly!


Results / Observations


Bioprocess/ Technical Observations:

  * Completion of this experiment went smoothly without any set backs. 
  * Coating
    * Bleach affects PDMS integrity (peels off the surface of the petri dish). 
    * No leakage of gel matrix observed. 
  * Pellet:
    * Pellet in the 500mL centrifuge tube was quite soft but did not dislodge when aspirating supernatant. 
    * All Pellets measured at the 5mL mark (in the 50mL Falcon tube) at the second centrifugation step (step 6). 
  * Future notes for overall improvement:
    * Coat plates a day before
    * Leave to dry (after from EtOH soaking) in the BSC overnight
    * Make up reagents 1-2 weeks ahead of time. 
    * Centrifugation of cells can be initiated during the Pluronic-188 coating time frame. 
    * Less things in the BSC the better 
    * Avoid doing too many conditions at once (unless there is enough assistance to do this) as this leads to cultures remaining in a stressful environment longer than necessary. 
    * Add growth medium VERY VERY slowly (water fall/ droplets at zero speed on the pipette guns) with the tip of the pipette pointing at the wall of the disc scaffold. 

Gelation Observations:

  * All cultures appeared to turning from opaque magenta to yellow within 15 minutes post seeding. 
  * All cultures gelled (to varing degrees). 

  * Condition 1 (Control): 
    * Weak gel formation but observed to be stiffer than the 'thickness' of the gel at the time of seeding. 
    * When petri dish was gently moved the gel matrix is observed to no longer 'adhere' to the walls of the disc scaffold. 
    *   

  * Condition 2 (Control gel matrix set at Ambient conditions): 
    * Weakest gel formation but 'stiffer' (loosely used terminology) than the gel matrix at the time of seeding
    *   

  * Condition 3: (Gel Matrix containing HEPES in cell+growth media suspension): 
    * Some what stiff gelation that lacks integrity. 
    * When petri dish was gently moved the gel matrix is observed to no longer 'adhere' to the walls of the disc scaffold.
    * Slightly granular appearing matrix and transparent 
    * Addition of growth media after ~3 hours led to operator accidentally inserting a pipette into the centre of the tissue disc which may affect adequate tissue formation. 
    *   

  * Condition 4: (Gel Matrix containing 0.2M NaOH solution): 2 hours and 30 minutes
    * Some what stiff gelation that lacks integrity. 
    * When petri dish was gently moved the gel matrix is observed to no longer 'adhere' to the walls of the disc scaffold.

Questions:

  * How many tissue discs (maximum) can be done in one experiment to try the most conditions
  * There are no replicates in this experiment.
  * Can we order a deeper tissue culture container (that is autoclave able)? Growth medium spillage is highly probelmatic for sterility and ease of handling
