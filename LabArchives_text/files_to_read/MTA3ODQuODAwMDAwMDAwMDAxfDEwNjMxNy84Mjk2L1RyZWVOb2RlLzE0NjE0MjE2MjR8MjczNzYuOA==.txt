Performed by: Zoe, Jesi, Varshana & Bec


1\. Cell counts performed by Eva.

  1. 221mL of RPMI + Nuvonis Growth media was added to 221mL of HyCell + Nuvonis Growth Media.
  2. 30mL aliquot taken into 1 x 50mL tube.
  3. 30uL of IGF-LR3 added
  4. 6uL of rEGF added
  5. Aliquot placed in water bath 14:07 pm
  6. 9M cells (17.36 mL from flask 12370 + 16.2 mL from flask 12371 of cell suspension) combined into 1 x 50mL tube and centrifuged at 500 x g for 5 min at RT.
    1. Start 14:29, End 14:34
  7. Supernatant aspirated.
  8. Pellet resuspended in 30mL of Growth Media prepared above.
  9. Cells seeded into 1 x E125 flask (flat bottom) and incubated at 37C, 5% CO2 and 120 RPM.

  

Seeding density: 0.402x10^6 cells / mL (target was 300,000)

Volume in flask: 30mL
