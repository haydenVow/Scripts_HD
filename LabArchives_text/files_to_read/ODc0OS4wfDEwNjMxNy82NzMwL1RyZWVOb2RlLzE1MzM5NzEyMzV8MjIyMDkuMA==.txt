Conditions

  * Flask 1: DMEM/F12 + 20% FBS
  * Flask 2: Opti Pro + 4 mM Glutamax (adherent Nuvonis) 
  * Flask 4: L15 + 4 mM Glutamax (CO2-free incubator)
  * Flask 5: L15 + 1 g/L YE (CO2-free incubator)

  

Cultureware / vessels required

2 x 50 mL falcons (for tryple and dPBS)

4 x 15 mL falcon tubes needed for JH (keep media)

4 x 15 mL falcon tubes needed to transfer cell suspension into a tube to
suspend thoroughly

4 x 15 mL falcon tubes for media

4 x T75 flasks to seed




### Process:

1\. Took images of each vessel with microscope on phase setting (4x and 10x).
[10:20 am]

2\. Aliquoted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then
placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath for a minimum of 20 minutes
prior to use:

  1. TrypLE:   5 x 4 x 1.1 = 22  mL in   1 x 50 mL  tube
  2.  dPBS (for neutralising & washing):   10 x 4 x 1.1 = 44  mL   

  3. Growth media (for seeding, for each of the 4 conditions):    12 x 4 mL

Time that all aliquots were placed in the water bath the warm before use
10:25 - 10:45  

Note: if aliquots were placed in water bath at different time, record the time
stamp for each individual solution.




3\. Removed vessel(s) from the incubator  10:20  

4\. Washed the vessel(s) with dPBS (warmed):

  * 5 mL per T75

5\. Added tryple to each vessel/well:

  * 5 mL per T75

and incubated at 30˚C.

6\. Start/Finish for TrypLE (10-12 mins) was   L15: 10:40-11:51 / Nuv &
control: 10:45-11:52  

7\. Neutralised with dPBS and moved the cell suspension into   4 x 15 mL
tubes  




8\. Aspirated the supernatant.

9\. Resuspended pellet in   2 (changed to 1) mL   growth  medium  

10\. Aliquoted   10 uL  of resuspended cells into a microcentrifuge tube for
cell count.

11\. Performed a cell count using the haemocytometer and recorded the cell
count data in the Google Doc spreadsheet: Cell Count Spreadsheet or cell count
widget below

Total cell number in Flask 10500 was:  

  * CHOMP09:   1,828,000 cells  

Total cell number in Flask 10501 was:  

  * CHOMP09:   588,000 cells  

Total cell number in Flask 10503 was:  

  * CHOMP09:   336,000 cells  

Total cell number in Flask 10504 was:  

  * CHOMP09:   224,000 cells  

  

Cell density per vessel:   ~7500 cells/cm2

12\. Transferred the cell suspension of the following volume into the   5 & 12
mL   pre-warmed growth media aliquots:

5% CO2

  * CHOMP09 cell suspension volume required for Flask 1:   307 uL 
  * CHOMP09 cell suspension volume required for Flask 2:   990 uL 

CO2-free

  * CHOMP09 cell suspension volume required for Flask 3:    total cell suspension (2000 uL)   

  * CHOMP09 cell suspension volume required for Flask 4:    total cell suspension (2000 uL)   

13\. Seeded into 4 x T75 flasks and created culture IDs.

14. Returned vessels to incubate at: 11:45 am; 12:00 pm respectively

  * [X]  30ºC, 0% CO2 (reptilian cells)
  * Incubator (#120), Lab [Main/Library/Production] - for cultures 10606, 10607

  * [X]  30ºC, 5% CO2 (reptilian cells)
  * Incubator (#116), Lab [Main/Library/Production] - for cultures 10608, 10609

  




Observations/Summary:

Passaged 4 x T75s

L15 media conditions were seeded into 2 x T25s

Serum control and Nuvonis adherent conditions were reseeded into T75s
