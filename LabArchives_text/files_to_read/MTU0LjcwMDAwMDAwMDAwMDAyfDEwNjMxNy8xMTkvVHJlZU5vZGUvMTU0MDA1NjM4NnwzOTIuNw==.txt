### Process:

Cultures: 6371, 6372, 6373

Took sample

  1. Transferred 0.02 mL of the well suspended microcarrier culture to a well in a 96-well plate. mixed with 0.08 mL of dPBS.
  2. Carriers were mixed by swirling on a flat surface of the BSC, sample was taken while the liquid was still in motion.
  3. Returned flasks to incubator at 15:10
  4. Inspected the microcarriers using the Axio microscope to observe monolayer (there should not be any overlapping microcarriers as this will hamper analysis.

Stained and imaged cells adhered to microcarriers

  1. Added the Hoechst 33342 ready flow reagent (nuc blue) at a concentration of 20 uL/mL of culture in the well plate (2 uL per well in a 96 well plate).
  2. Left the plate to incubate at room temperature, covered in foil, for 15 minutes. 15:19 - XX:XX
  3. Took 3 sets of 2 images (using the phase contrast and blue fluorescence channels) of each well. XX:XX 

Analyzed images

  1. MICROCARRIERS: The best set of images from each culture was used to determine the distribution of cells/microcarrier using the FIJI-based microcarrier image analysis macro.
