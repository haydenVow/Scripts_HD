Protocol


  

  1. Wells imaged 3 times at 4x and 10 magnification each.
  2. 2 mLs removed from each well using a pipette.
  3. 2 mLs of fresh RPMI/HyCell 50:50 added to each well with a serological pipette.
  4. Incubated.

Observations


Where a secondary material has been incorporated, the gel component has broken
down, however in the condition with Jellagen present, this has been reduced to
some degree.

Biogel only conditions showed a significant reduction in scaffold size and
evidence that it is also breaking down.

The metabolic load on the media seems excessively high with media changing
colour to a light yellow after 1 day. This seems to be caused by high cell
proliferation outside of the biomaterials in the media.

  

I believe that this high metabolic load is leaching calcium out of the
alginate and contributing to breaking it down, in addition the significant
growth of the cells breaks the material apart.

  

Suggestions:

\- Perhaps increase algiante concentration

\- Add in more of a scaffold structure to the biogel

\- Bettter incorporate the secondary material into the gel
