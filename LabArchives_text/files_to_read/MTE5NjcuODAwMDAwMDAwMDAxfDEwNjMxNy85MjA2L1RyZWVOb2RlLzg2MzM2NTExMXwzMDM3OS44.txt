Process:

  1. Obtained 110 million cells in 45mL of culture suspension from Culture 13196 from cell supply.
  2. Aliquotted cell suspension in 50ml falcon tube and centrifuged for 5 mins at 300g.
  3. Placed all three media bottles in water bath at 10:32am for 25 minutes
  4. Removed supernatant RPMI media and resuspended cells in 45mL of Seed Media (PRF D/F + 3.75 mg/ml BSA).
  5. Aliquotted 40mL (100 million cells) into 1L of Seed Media.
  6. Seeded 2 x 4CF using the 1L cell suspension (500mL each cell factory) and placed in Incubator 52 in Main Lab (11:00am)
  7. Aliquotted 2 x 30mL of Seed Media for T175 seeding.
  8. Removed 1.4mL of media from each aliquot.
  9. Added 1.4mL of cell suspension (3.75 million cells) from the 45mL culture suspension aliquot to each 30mL aliquot of seed media.
  10. Each 30mL cell suspension aliquot was used to seed a T175 flask each.
  11. T-flasks were placed in incubator 52 at 11:30am (approx).




Observations/Summary:

  * 2 x 4CFs and 2 x T175s were seeded at 20,000 cells/cm2.
