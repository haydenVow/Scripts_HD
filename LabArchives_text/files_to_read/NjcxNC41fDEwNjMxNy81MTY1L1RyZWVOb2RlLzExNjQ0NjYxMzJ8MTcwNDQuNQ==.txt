Nando cells were deemed no longer good to take forward into continuous
culture. The cells, whilst seemingly healthy did not differentiate despite
being in E6 media. We expect this is because the early change into E6 media
when the cells were not 100% confluent. This came about because the cells,
assuming scenecing, were left in culture for 5 days without a feed. Upon
observing on the fifth day, they had grown and showed signs of potential.
Media was switched to E6 to accomodate for lack of growth media feed and the
possibility that cells may have begun to release differentiation signs.
