Performed by: LL




Growth Media:

  * [x]   ~~DMEM/F12 + 10% FBS + 1X P/S~~ D/F + 20% FBS + 1xP/S  
  

    * Was unsure about 10%FBS  medium being correct so checked isolation lab notebook and culture medium used in isolation (https://au-mynotebook.labarchives.com/share/Vow%2520-%2520Team%2520Science/NDg0Ny43fDEwNjMxNy8zNzI5L1RyZWVOb2RlLzIxMTg5MjYxODN8MTIzMDUuNjk5OTk5OTk5OTk5) was DMEM/F12 + 20% FBS +1xP/S - going to use 20% FBS medium for feed to stay consistent
