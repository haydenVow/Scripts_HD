Process:

1\. Aliquotted  8 mL  mL of  Growth Media into   1x 15 mL    tube(s). Placed
in water bath  14:56

2\. Removed  25% of supernatant from vessel. (using a new tip for each
individual well, aspirated 50uL/well)

3\. Replaced with  0.05 mL (per well) of  Growth   media.

4\. Returned vessel to incubate at: :

  * [X]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (aviary cells)

  

  * Incubator (#77), Lab [Library]
