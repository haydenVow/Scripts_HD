To Harvest and Fix cultures from experiment 3, to conduct quantitative and
qualitative analyses at a later date.

Methods


  1. Remove cultures from the incubator.
  2. Take an image of the 2 plates with an ipad for later qualitative analysis. 
  3. Remove growth media
  4. Wash each well with 5mL of PBS.
  5. Wash each well a second time with 5mL of PBS.
  6. Using a scissor, cut the arms of the tissue formations, and then section the centre of the tissue into 3 pieces. 
    1. Place the side sections into a 0.5mL Eppendorf tube. 
      1. Place in the -80C for using analysis. 
    2. Place the centre section into a 12 W-P with 2mL of 4%PFA.
      1. Parafilm and place in the 4C Fixing an Staining Fridge. 17:45


Observations/Summary:


### Scaffold cultures 12663 and 12664 had the tissue formations (seeded at 15M
Cell/mL) harvest by removing growth media, washing, and then finally fixing in
4% PFA and placing in a 4C Fridge for future analysis.
