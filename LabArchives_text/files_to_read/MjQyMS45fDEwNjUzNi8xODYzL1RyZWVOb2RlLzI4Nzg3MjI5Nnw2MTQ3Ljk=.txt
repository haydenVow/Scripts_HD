Procedure

Starting a Seed Train - Day 1

  1. Equilibrate a water bath to 37°C.
  2. Prepare the appropriate volume of complete RPMI 1640:CHOin1 (1:1) and place in water bath for at least 20 minutes.
    1. Seed cells at 500kcells/mL
  3. Select the vial(s) for thawing according to the relevant experiment or production batch plan.
  4. Thaw vial(s) of Nuvonis quail cells (QH9-2/1) in the 37°C water bath for a maximum of 5min or until just thawed.
  5. Dry wipe the cryovial(s).
  6. Wet a wipe with disinfectant (e.g., 70% ethanol), wipe the tube(s) and transfer it into a BSC.
  7. Tap the vial gently to detach the cell pellet, and using a p1000 pipette resuspend the cells by gently aspirating up and down at least 5 times. Repeat this step for any additional vials.
  8. Transfer the cells directly into the media aliquot prepared earlier.
  9. Rinse the vial with an additional 1 mL of growth medium to collect any remaining cells. Repeat for any additional vials.
  10. Homogenise the cell suspension using a serological pipette and gently aspirate and dispense the cell suspension several times.
  11. Retrieve 2x 50 μl samples for a cell count. See below.
  12. Transfer the cell suspension into the three 6-well ULA plates, with 5 mL in each well 
  13. Transfer the 6-well ULA plate(s) to an incubator at 37°C, 5% CO2, 95% relative humidity. (Static)
  14. To count the cells and to assess cell viability, mix one 50 μl cell sample with trypan blue to a 1:1 ratio (i.e., 20 μl cell sample : 20 μl trypan blue) in a 1.5 mL micro-centrifuge tube.
  15. Add 10 μl to a chamber of a Neubauer improved haemocytometer slide.
  16. Perform a cell count and record data in the MFG "New cell count calculator" spreadsheet --> https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1sDqHQ7x2J-_lqIVKhfBqnXJRjsNZAR724wiLtSYLI8g/edit#gid=235487472
  17. Repeat steps 16-18 with the other 50 μl and calculate the average total number of cells and the average number of viable cells.

Note: The 50:50 RPMI:CHO WCB was being banked today and they had extra cells,
so instead of thawing vials for this seed train cells were taken directly from
the 50:50 RPMI:CHO WCB bank culture (12743, 12744)
