Aim/Purpose


The overarching aim of this study is to assess variations in doubling times
between F_CHOMP07/09 cell lines and between their MCBs versus WCBs. In
addition we will take the opportunity to look at the effect of different
culture media compositions on F_CHOMP cell doubling times.


Hypothesis


1\. There will be no significant difference between the average cell doubling
times of F_CHOMP07 and F_ CHOMP09 MCBs  
2\. There will be no significant difference between the average cell doubling
times of F_ CHOMP07 and F_ CHOMP09 WCBs  
3\. There will be no significant difference between the average cell doubling
times of F_ CHOMP07 and F_ CHOMP09 MCBs compared to their respective WCBs  
4\. There will be no significant difference between the average cell doubling
times of F_ CHOMP09 WCB cells cultured in ACF media containing fresh 100ng
each of FGF, IGF1, PDGF + 0.1% chemically defined lipid concentrate.  compared
to those cultured in media containing a thawed 'bullet' of the same growth
factors.  
5\. There will be no significant difference between the average cell doubling
times of F_ CHOMP09 WCBs when cultured in DMEM/F12 + 20% FBS compared to 20%
KSR without growth factors.  
6\. There will be no significant difference between the average cell doubling
times of F_ CHOMP09 WCB cells in ACF media containing 100ng each of FGF, IGF1,
PDGF + 0.1% chemically defined lipid concentrate, compared to those containing
no growth factors (KSR only).  
7\. There will be no significant difference between the average cell doubling
times of F_ CHOMP09 WCBs when cultured in DMEM/F12 + 20%  FBS compared to
Fibrolife base media supplemented with 100ng each of FGF, IGF1, PDGF + 0.1%
chemically defined lipid concentrate.

  


Technical Gap


Currently, F_CHOMP07 and F_CHOMP09 cell lines have only been grown to p7 and
p8 respectively and we do not have an understanding of their proliferative
limits.  We have also previously only cultured these cells in DMEM/F12 and
M199 based media containing 20% FBS (see lab books here: https://au-
mynotebook.labarchives.com/share/Vow%2520-%2520Team%2520Science/NDE4Ny4zfDEwNjMxNy8zMjIxLTI0NzI0L1RyZWVOb2RlLzc4ODA3OTIzNXwxMDYyOS4z).
We saw dramatic differences in cell doubling times in DMEM/F12 versus M199
media, and it is likely that with further media optimisation, we can also
optimise cell growth.


Method/Procedure


  

D0: Thaw CHOMP09 and CHOMP07 WCB and MCB vials and seed at a density of 7,500
cells/cm in 7x 96 well plates, following the plate map shown below.  
D1-D7: Fix 1 plate per day. For all remaining plates, perform a 50% media
change with respective medias every 48hrs.  
D7- After all plates have been fixed, stain with dapi and image on the Zaber.
Use Mia Dapi counting macro to perform nuclei counts and determine cell
numbers.  
  
After all data has been collected, import to GraphPad Prism to determine cell
doubling times and perform comparative analysis between groups.
