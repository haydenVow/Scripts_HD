### Process:

1\. Took 2 x images of each vessel with microscope on phase setting (4X to
assess confluence)

2\. Aliquoted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then
placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath for a minimum of 20 minutes
prior to use:

  1. TrypLE:   10  mL in   1 x 50 mL  tube.   

  2.  dPBS (for neutralising & washing):   10  mL17:50
  3. Growth media (for pellet resuspension):  5 mL (2mL per pellet) Placed in waterbath: 17:47     

  4. Growth media (for seeding): 2x   12  mL Placed in waterbath: 17:47

Note: if aliquots were placed in water bath at different time, record the time
stamp for each individual solution.




3\. Removed vessel(s) from the incubator   17:40  

4\. Washed the vessel(s) with  5 mL per flask dPBS.

5\. Added   5  mL tryple to each vessel/well and incubated at 37˚C.

  1. Start/Finish for TrypLE was     17:45 - 17:55   

6\. Neutralised with   5 mL per flask   dPBS and moved the cell suspension
into   2 x 50 mL  tubes.

7\. Centrifuged at 650 x g for 5 min.

  1. Start/Finish time for centrifugation was  17:59-18:04   

  

  




8\. Aspirated the supernatant.

9\. Resuspended pellet in   2  mL   growth  medium  

10\. Aliquoted   11 uL  of resuspended cells into a microcentrifuge tube for
cell count.

11\. Performed a cell count using the haemocytometer and recorded the cell
count data in the Google Doc spreadsheet: Cell Count Spreadsheet or cell count
widget below

  1. Total cell number was:  
    * CHOMP07: 2,680,000  

    * CHOMP09: 3,784,000  

  2. Volume of cell suspension required for subculture was:  
    1. CHOMP07: 420uL  

    2. CHOMP09: 297uL
  3. Cell density per vessel:   7500 cells/cm2     




12\. Transferred the cell suspension of the following volume into the pre-
warmed   12 mL growth medium:  

  * CHOMP07:  420 uL     

  * CHOMP09:  297 uL   

13\. Transferred cell suspension into   2x T75  vessels.

14\. Transferred vessel(s) to incubate at:  18:32  

  * [ ]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (avian cells)
  * [x]  30ºC, 5% CO2 (reptilian cells)
