96 well plate  
  
Process:

  1. Removed 3 x 96 well plates from fixed plates fridge [09:49am]
  2. Using Live view and adjusting exposure settings, set up imaging session with the following exposure times in ms, on main lab Zaber as shown below:
  3. DAPI: 50 ms
  4. AF488: 400 ms
  5. AF555: 800 ms

3\. 96 well plate was calibrated and then using the HCS Site Generator Tool,
wells B2 - C4 were selected

4\. Prior to each plate, QR code was scanned and session was named - ensuring
images would upload to MIA capture.

5\. For AF488 and AF555 imaging sessions, a piece of black plastic was used
over the plate to block out unwanted light from outside.

6\. Each channel was imaged seperately in different jobs.
