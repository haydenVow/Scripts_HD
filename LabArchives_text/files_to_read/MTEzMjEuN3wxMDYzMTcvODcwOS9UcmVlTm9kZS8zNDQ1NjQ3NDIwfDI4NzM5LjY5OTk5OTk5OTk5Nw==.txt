Reagent  
Volume (mL)  
Ranger ID  
  
Collagen I (2.6mg/mL)  
40Mix 12824

Before Starting Ensure:

  * Matrix reagents are made up fresh:
    * Collagen I to 2.6mg/mL - stock is at 6.17mg/mL - dilution factor 1:2.4
      * need ~ 40 mL total (make 42 mL)
      * Leave in the fridge until use.
    * Other Reagents have been sterile-filtered (Collagen doesn't filter
  *  ~~Agar is autoclaved first thing in the morning and maintained on the hotplate to keep molten (or a small, high temp Sous Vide bath)~~
  * Week before: adhere 6x nylon scaffolds to petri dishes using PDMS    20/06/2022  
  * Place moulds in Ethanol bath at least overnight




Scaffold mounting, sterilisation and coating

  

  1. Place Moulds into 80% Ethanol bath - start     26/06/22 
  2. UV irradiate for 60 minutes under the mobile UV (reptile) lamp - start     :   am
  3. Pre-coat with 0.2% Pluronic solution for 1 hour (to prevent adhesion), start     :   pm 




Preparation for Harvest

  1. Prepare 10 falcon tubes for cell harvest for 4 conditions on plate 1 and 6 conditions on plate 2
  2. Completed calculations can be found here: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1nAKlh6US6Xud95YGlDTkI4LHBWjzlAxnhmTym1P2bUw/edit#gid=66228982
  3. Media preparation for harvest and seeding: 50-50 RPMI/Hycell mix
    1. 500mL 50-50 RPMI/Hycell 

Cell Harvest for mould seeding - Nuvonis suspesion protocol

  1. Harvest cells with Cell Supply passaging protocol
  2. Count cells with haemocytometer/Vicell for total yields:
    1. Total yield flask #XXX =    Billion   

    2. Total yield flask #XXX =    Billion 
    3. Total volume per #XXX =      mL  
    4. Total volume per #XXX =      mL  
    5. Cell concentration #XXX =     cells/mL  
    6. Cell concentration  #XXX =     cells/mL  
  3. Aliquot required volume into falcon tube at each cell density:
    1. Plate 1 = 180M cells per falcon x 4 conditions (#1-4) =       mL     

    2. Plate 2 = 120M total per falcon x 6 =       mL  
  4. Centrifuge at 650g for 5 minutes: start    :   
  5. Resuspend PLATE 1 pellets in 4mL of 50-50 Media and make up to total volume of 5.75mL to account for pellet volume
  6. Resuspend PLATE 2 pellets in 2.5mL of 50-50 Media and make up to total volume of 3.85mL to account for pellet volume
  7. Proceed to matrix additions below

  

Matrix formation for scaffold seeding - Plate 1 - volumes are all the same

N.B. Repeat this gel formation for each falcon tube one at a time (3
replicates) - but be sure to move quickly as this is a very high cell density

  1. Add Nanocellulose type (4 types) and mix well with stripette (not resuspending forcefully):
    1. Nanocellulose volume to add =    60 uL   

  2. Add Collagen I (Devro: final concentration 2.6mg/ml) and mix well with stripette (not resuspending forcefully):
    1. Collagen I volume to add =    4.9 mL  
  3. Add 10xDMEM/F12 and mix with stripette:
    1. 10x DMEM volume to add =    590 uL  
  4. Add 0.1M Sodium Hydroxide and mix with stripette:
    1. NaOH volume to add =    730 uL  
  5. Remove pluronic from wells
  6. Seed    4mL    gel/matrix gently into scaffold ensuring good distribution around pillars in the well 
  7. Leave for    60-90    minutes to gel at 37째C - start time    :    
  8. Add     ~150mL   50-50 Media to entire 15mL dish, ensure entire mould is covered
  9. Culture at 37째C overnight before checking

  

Matrix formation for scaffold seeding - Plate 2 - volumes differ

N.B. Repeat this gel formation for each falcon tube one at a time (2
replicates) - but be sure to move quickly as this is a very high cell density

  1. Add Nanocellulose and mix well with stripette (not resuspending forcefully):
    1. Nanocellulose 0.25% volume to add =   20 uL  
    2. Nanocellulose 0.75% volume to add =   60 uL  
    3. Nanocellulose 1.5% volume to add =   120 uL  
  2. Add Collagen I (Devro: final concentration 2.6mg/ml) and mix well with stripette (not resuspending forcefully):
    1. Collagen I volume to add =    3.25 mL  
  3. Add 10xDMEM/F12 and mix with stripette:
    1. 10x DMEM volume to add =    390 uL  
  4. Add 0.1M Sodium Hydroxide and mix with stripette:
    1. NaOH volume to add =    490 uL

  8. Add     ~150mL   50-50 Media to entire 15mL dish, ensure entire mould is covered
  9. Culture at 37째C overnight before checking




Tips and Tricks for this protocol:

  * When pelleting cells, make sure they are completely dry
  * Flick pellet to dislodge before adding medium
  * Add Medium first to pellet to prevent clumping and cell death
  * Col1 is very viscous, pipette carefully - when adding 10x DMEM, it turns yellow
  * As soon as you add the NaOH, be quick as the Col starts to gel
  * Everything has to be exact, don't be tempted to add more cells than the volume stated if there are some left
  * Add cells slowly!
