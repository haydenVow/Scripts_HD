Harvest 2xCC500AP


Procedure

## Bottom-up Operation for Cell Harvest:

### Remove Media:

  1. Discard Conditioned Cell Culture Medium
  2. Bring CelCradle bottle into biosafety cabinet.
  3. Open cap and carefully discard conditioned culture medium without flushing out the carriers.

### Wash with dPBS Buffer Solution:

  1. Add 500 ml pre-warmed dPBS into CelCradle bottle.
  2. Take bottle to be ready to set up: Up/Down speed 2.0 mm/s Top/bottom holding time 0 sec
  3. Start compression for 10 mins. Time stamp: 14:09 - 14:19
  4. Discard dPBS solutions.  
TIP: Use a spatula or weighing spoon to prevent the macrocarriers from coming
out when pouring, if any do some out and remain sterile, aseptically transfer
them back into the CelCradle bottle.  
Waste media and Wash dPBS were spun down to see if there were any viable cells
in it  
Esco Aster suggest washing twice in HBSS/EDTA but as we are using dPBS I chose
to only wash once.  
  

### Enzymatic reaction:

  1. Add 200mL pre-warmed TrypLE. Cap with the white non-vented cap.   

  2. Reverse the bottle. Tap the bottle until all carriers drop down to the cap side and are completely submerged.
  3. Bring the bottle to CO2 incubator.
  4. Incubate for 10mins. Amount of incubation time depends on cell density.  Timestamp: 14:30 - 14:40
  5. Site back and tap the bottle until all carriers drop back to the matrix basket.
  6. Allow the enzyme to flow down to the bellows.
  7. Incubate for additional 10mins.  Timestamp: 14:41 - 14:51  
TIP: sufficient time for enzymatic digestion is critical for a successful cell
harvest. Most cells can render trypsin-EDTA for above 30 mins without altering
viability. High cells density will require more trypsin and time to digest.

### Tap bottle:  
This step was accidentally missed

  1. Tap the bottle sharply and steady by against your palm at the matrix basket position for 3mins.
  2. Rotate the bottle during tapping.

### Wash off and collect cells:

Suggested method by Esco Aster:

  1. Add 5ml 0.5 mg/ml DNase and 25ml 0.1% trypsin inhibitor (or serum) into 500 ml culture medium or HBSS
  2. Add the 500 ml solution into the bottle.
  3. Cap the non-vented cap firmly.
  4. Invert the bottle. Swirl to wash off the cells from the carriers.
  5. Pour the cell-laden solution into centrifuge bottles.
  6. Place the centrifuge bottles into centrifuge.
  7. Harvest cells by centrifugation.
  8. Tap the bottle as step 4.
  9. Pour the supernatant from the centrifuge bottles back to the CelCradle bottle and wash off cells from the bottle.
  10. Repeat step 4 and step 5 two more times until cell residues below an acceptable range (take carrier samples to check the harvest efficiency).
  11. Collect all cell pellet together. Check the cell density and viability.

What was actually done:

  1. Pour out TrypLE from the CelCradle-500AP bottle into a clean 1L bottle.
  2. Add 500mL of dPBS into the bottle.
  3. Cap with the non-vented cap.
  4. Invert the bottle. Swirl to wash off the cell from the carriers.
  5. Repeat steps 2-4 another 3 times until the solution is clear.
  6. Once all the dPBS and TrypLE solution is collected, pour the cell-laden solution into centrifuge bottles.
  7. Place the centrifuge bottles into centrifuge.
  8. Harvest cells by centrifugation.

Cell Count:

  1. Perform a cell count using the heamocytometer
  2. For the waste media and 1st dPBS wash soltuion, perform a cell count without Trypan Blue and take images of the cells/debris
  3. For the harvested cells, perform a cell count with the appropriate dilution of Trypan Blue

DAPI Staining:

1 BioNOC was taken from each bottle BEFORE harvest and 2 were taken from each
bottle AFTER harvest

1. 1 BioNOC was taken from each flask using sterile forceps   
2\. Add 1mL 70% Ethanol to each well for 15 minutes  
3\. Remove ethanol and wash with dPBS  
4\. Add DAPI (1:1000) in dPBS for 5min  
5\. Remove all liquid and image

Imaging:

  1. Image cells on the Zaber using the DAPI setting with an exposure of 5-10. 
  2. Make sure all of the liquid is removed from the well before trying to image the BioNOC carrier.  
NOTE: If there is enough liquid in the well the BioNOC carrier will move
around during imaging which will result in blurry images. I also find the
images are clearer without liquid being present.

  3. When taking a single image of the centre of the well, the BioNOC carrier might not always be in the correct position. To get the carrier into the correct position; focus the microscope on the centre of the well, take off the lid of the well-plate and use a pipette tip to gently move the BioNOC until it is comfortably in frame.
  4. Perform a z-stack image on a single spot in the centre of the well.
