Pre-work:

1\. Coat 6 wells of a 6 well plate with 2mL of gelatin each and incubate for 1
hour at 37 degrees. Start time: 9:31am

Gelatin Mix ID: 3844

2\. Remove gelatin and seal the plate with parafilm and store in the fridge
until FACS sorting.

  

Preparing for FACS:

  1. Place 6mL DMEM/F12+20%FBS + 1x PS in the waterbath for at least 20 minutes 9:35am
  2. Thaw single cell suspension from DOLLY15 currently frozen at -80 degrees C by placing vial into the water bath for five minutes. 10:48-10:53  
#4240-Sheep-P0-vial2of4 (1637-Culture-4239-Vial-1of4)  

  3. Add 500uL of warmed media (DMEM/F12+20%FBS) to the frozen vial to reduce osmotic shock. Mix ID 4336  

  4. Wash the cells:  
             a. Transfer the 1mL of cell suspension to a 15mL conical tube.  
             b. Spin down the cells for 5 minutes and remove the supernatant `10:55 - 11 am`  
             c. Re-suspend cells in 5mL of DMEM/F12+20%FBS.  
             d. Perform a cell count. The concentration of the cell suspension should ultimately be 10-20 x 10^6 cells per mL.  
             e. Spin down the cells for 5 minutes at 300g and 4 degrees C. After this, keep things COLD. Lots of ice should be around.
  5. Re-suspend the cell pellet in 600uL of WM (wash media = DMEM/F12 with 10% horse serum & 1X P/S). Bring some of this to Garvan.  Calculate the concentration of the cell suspension. If outside the range of 10-20 million cells per mL, adjust the antibody concentrations accordingly. Ideally we should hit 5-10*10^6 cells/mL for optimal flow sorting. Wash media = mix ID 4347 Approximately 2 million cells  

  6. Transfer 10uL of cell suspension to a 5mL FACS tube containing 190uL WM and keep on ice. This is the unstained control sample.
  7.  Transfer 10uL of cell suspension to a 5mL FACS tube containing 190uL WM and keep on ice. This is the isotype control. Add the appropriate amount of Antibody Secondary - APC Rat IgG2a Kappa Isotype Control (0.25uL in this instance, but if the number of cells & amount of antibody in step 7 changes, this concentration will have to be adapted. The same amount of antibody per cell should be added in steps 6 and 7.
  8. Transfer the rest of the cell suspension (~500uL) into a labeled tube. Add 5uL of CD31-APC antibody. (ab at 200ug/mL)
  9. Antibodies should be used at about 1ug per 10,000,000 cells. 
  10. Keeping on ice, place all staining samples on a rocker and incubate for 40 minutes (Start transport to Garvan at this point in time)  

At the Garvan:

  1. Fill all tubes to 2mL with WM. Gently invert the tubes a few times to mix.
  2. Centrifuge at 250g with a fixed angle rotor for 5 min at 4 degrees C.
  3. Aspirate supernatant completely. Re-suspend cells in control tubes in 200uL WM and the bigger sort sample in 500uL WM. Use a low volume pipette tip with narrow opening to aspirate media to be really careful. 
  4. Add Hoest (added directly into all 3 samples, 1:100x) and incubate RT for 10 minutes. 
  5. Protect tubes from light from here.
  6. Centrifuge at 350g for 5 minutes at 4 degree. Aspirate supernatant. Add 200-500uL of WM and re-suspend.
  7. Centrifuge again at 350g for 5 minutes at 4 degree. Aspirate supernatant. 
  8. Resuspend in 200-500uL of PRF DMEM/F12 + 2% FBS, no PS then hand to operator.
  9. Transfer the cells to the trainer cap attached to a 5mL FACS tube. Gently tap the tube on the bench to facilitate flow through. (provided by the Garvan)
  10. Rinse the 2mL used to stain the sort sample with another 500uL WM and pass through the same strainer cap. Use a 20-200uL pipette to collect any remaining liquid in the strainer cap from the under side. Add another 1mL of WM to the sort sample and mix by gentle votex.
  11.  Add PI to a final concentration of 0.3ug/mL into the controls and sort samples
  12.  Sort absolutely ASAP for highest yield and viability.
  13.   
In the Flow Core at the Garvan:  

    26. 1\. Set up the cell sorter in accordance with the manufacturer's specifications with the 70-Î¼m nozzle.   
2\. At the lowest flow rate, run the unstained sample to ensure that the
voltages are appropriately set and that the cell population is properly
positioned in the FSC-A and SSC plot and exhibits low background fluorescence
in all channels (Figure 1A and 1C).  
3\. Run all controls to ensure that positive populations can be distinctly
separated from background.  
4\. Create a gate on the FSC-A and SSC plot that excludes debris. Debris from
uninjured muscle is often distinct from cells on this plot and debris from
injured muscle may not be apparent.  
5\. Create a gate on the FSC-W plot for intact single cells only. (Author's
note: In our experience, this gate excludes dead cells and fragmented fibers,
both of which exhibit irregular dimensions when isolating quiescent MuSCs from
uninjured muscle. This gate can also exclude doublets of cells when isolating
activated MuSCs and their proliferating progeny after acute muscle injury.)  
6. Create gates to collect the CD31+ population into 1 ml WM.  
7\. The unstained portion (waste) can be brought back to Vow & re-frozen.
(Just use 2 x tubes & keep them really cold, then transfer to warm plate when
home)  
8\. The CD31+ endothelial cells should be placed into a coated 6 well plate
immediately. If they can be directly sorted in, then that's great.  

    27.   
  
Back at Vow  
After transport back to Vow, the endothelial cells should receive a media
change to DMEM/F12 + 20% FBS + 1x PS with an additional 5-10ng/mL FGFb, VEGF,
10ng/mL EGF, IGF1, heparin (50ug or 100ug/mL), spiked in for additional
support (this should be made in advance) - heparin & FGF combo is important.
Asking at the garvan for it, but if we can't get it, cest la vie. Add 5 ng/mL
if you are adding 100ug/mL heparin, otherwise bump it to 10ng/mL FGF.

IGF - 100ug/mL - 10uL into 100mL  

EGF - 100ug/mL - 10uL into 100mL

FGF - 25ug/mL - 40uL into 100mL  
VEGF - 5uL into 100mL

  

2000ng in 20uL

2ug in 0.02mL

  

  

Want 100ug/mL
