NOTE:

1\. Counts were not performed today due to time constraints.  

2\. We have run out of Rock inhibitor, so for this feed, it was replaced with
Revitacell 1:100

7045-F_DOLLY12-Sheep P11-1of5 : Serum  
7046-F_DOLLY12-Sheep P11-2of5 : Pluronic  
7047-F_DOLLY12-Sheep P11-3of5 : ACA + Revitacell  
7048-F_DOLLY12-Sheep P11-4of5 : Revitacell  
7049-F_DOLLY12-Sheep P11-5of5 : Serum




Growth Media:

  * [X ]  DMEM/F12 + 20% FBS + 1X P/S
  * [X ]  DMEM/F12 + 20% FBS + 1X P/S + ROCKi (ROCKi replaced with Revitacell 1:100)
  * [X ]  DMEM/F12 + 20% FBS + 1X P/S + ROCKi + 1:100 ACA (ROCKi replaced with Revitacell 1:100)
  * [X ]  DMEM/F12 + 20% FBS + 1X P/S + Pluronic F-68




Process:

  

1\. Place the pre-aliquotted  10 mL  mL of each respective type of Growth
Media into the water bath  14:50  

2\. Placed shake tubes in centrifuge and centrifuge at 650 x g for 5 min at
RT.   14:55-15:00

Aspirated supernatant from each pellet

Added 1mL of respective growth media to each tube and used a P1000 pipette to
break up cell clumps.

10uL of each culture taken for viability check

Remaining 9mL of each respective media was added afterwards and triturated
with 10mL serological pipette to break up cell clumps for each culture further
and resuspend cells evenly.

4\. Returned 4 x vessel to incubate at:   15:20 Shaking at 206 RPM

  * [X ]  37ÂºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * Incubator (#67 ), Lab [Library]




  

Observations:

  

 100  % media changed on vessel(s)
