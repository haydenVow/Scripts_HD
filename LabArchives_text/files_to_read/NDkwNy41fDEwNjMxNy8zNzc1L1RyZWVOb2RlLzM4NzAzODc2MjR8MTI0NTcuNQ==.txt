CHOMP FIBROBLAST SUSPENSION TRIAL  
  
Conditions  
1. WCB fibroblasts thawed directly into static suspension culture (5mL in 1x well of a 6-well plate, 1M cells/mL if possible)  
2. WCB fibroblasts thawed directly into shaker flask suspension culture (5ml, 1M cells/mL if possible, 206PRM)  
3. Raw homogenate (collagenase digested) thawed directly into static culture (half a thawed vial 5mL in 1x well of a 6-well plate)  
4. Raw homogenate (collagenase digested) thawed directly into shaker flask (half a thawed vial in 5ml, 206PRM).   
  
For static cultures, cell suspension/media should be pipet mixed daily to
disturb cells. As CHOMP cells appear slow to attach to culture plastic, this
may be sufficient to prevent cell attachment. Shaker conditions should be
cultured in 5mL media, in 50mL shaker flasks. All cultures should be diluted,
filtered, receive a 100% media change, and be counted every 4 days for at
least 30 days.  
  
Culture media: DMEM/F12 +20% FBS + 1x P/S for all cultures.
