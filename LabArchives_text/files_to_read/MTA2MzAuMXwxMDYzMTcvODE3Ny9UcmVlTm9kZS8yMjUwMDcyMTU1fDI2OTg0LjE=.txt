## Performed by: Bonnie




Process:

  1. Observed cultures under the microscope, all were overconfluent. 
  2. Aliquoted reagents and placed in the cell culture incubator to warm >45 minutes prior to use: TrypLE:    20mL Growth media (for pellet resuspension):    100   mL of each media
  3. Removed media from flasks 
  4. Washed with 10mL PBS to wash 
  5. Added 5mL Tryple to each flask and incubated at 37C for 10min 
  6. Added 5mL PBS to each flask, then transferred the mix to 50mL centrifuge tubes
  7. Centrifuged for 5 min at approx 500g. 
  8. Removed supernatant and resuspended cell pellets in 5mL of their respective growth media.
  9. Took 40ul aliquots from each tube to perform cell counts.
  10. Performed trypan blue counts for each culture and recoded in the cell count spreadsheet

CELL COUNTS  
JUMBOO- 27,700,000  
JUMBOK- 9,200,000  
JUMBOF- 6,100,000

  11. Reseeded JUMBOO into 3x T175 flasks, and JUMBOK + JUMOBOF into 1x T175 in 30mL per flask of their respective medias.
