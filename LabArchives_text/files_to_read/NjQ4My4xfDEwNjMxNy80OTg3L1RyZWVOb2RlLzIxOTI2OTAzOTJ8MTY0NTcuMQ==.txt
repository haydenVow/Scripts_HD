Media/Reagents used:

NameDetailsVolume used (mL)  
Growth/Proliferation Media + p38iA7520 (M4663)  
64.8 (two aliquots of 35 ml each)  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
100 uL * 54 wells in one plate * 12 plates = 64.8 ml in total




  

Process:

  

  1. Used the  2 x 35 mL  aliquots of  Growth Media + p38i contained in the Weekend Feeds Only box in the 117 fridge.
  2. Placed in water bath   08:45 a/pm
  3. Remove warm DMEM/F12 + 20% FBS + 1x P/S + p38i media from the water bath labelled with C2C12. 
    1. Replaced  50% (100uL) of DMEM/F12 + 20% FBS + 1x P/S + p38i supernatant from vessel (All the wells contained between wells B3 to B11 and G3 to G11).
    2. Use 3 tips of the multi-channel pipette to aspirate the media from wells B3-D3 (vertically).
    3. There is NO NEED TO CHANGE TIPS for the feeds of the 6 x 96 wp containing C2C12 cells.
    4. Add 100uL warm media to wells B3-D3 immediately.
    5. Aspirate from wells E3-G3 (vertically).
    6. Add 100uL warm media to wells E3-G3 immediately.
    7. Repeat for columns 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 and 11 in all 6 x 96 wp plates.
    8. Returned vessels to incubate at:   10:15 am/pm

  

  

(DO NOT FEED THE FOLLOWING 6 PLATES (DOLLY12); CELLS ARE DEAD)

  

  1. Removed all DOLLY12 96 wp (6 plates in total) from the incubator into the BSC.
    1. Remove warm DMEM/F12 + 20% FBS + 1x P/S + p38i media from the water bath labelled with DOLLY12.
    2. Replaced  50% (100uL) of DMEM/F12 + 20% FBS + 1x P/S + p38i supernatant from vessel (All the wells contained between wells B3 to B11 and G3 to G11).
    3. Use 3 tips of the multi-channel pipette to aspirate the media from wells B3-D3 (vertically).
    4. There is NO NEED TO CHANGE TIPS for the feeds of the 6 x 96 wp containing DOLLY12 cells.
    5. Add 100uL warm media to wells B3-D3 immediately.

    7. Add 100uL warm media to wells E3-G3 immediately.
    8. Repeat for columns 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 and 11 in all 6 x 96 wp plates.
    9. Returned vessels to incubate at:   : am/pm 
    10. Removed all C2C12 96 wp (6 plates in total) from the incubator into the BSC.
  2. [X]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  3. [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (aviary cells)
