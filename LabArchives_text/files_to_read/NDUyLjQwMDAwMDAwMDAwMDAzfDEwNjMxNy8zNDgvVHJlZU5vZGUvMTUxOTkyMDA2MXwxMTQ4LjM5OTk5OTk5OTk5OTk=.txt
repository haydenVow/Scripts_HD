Method/Procedure


There are 2x working cell bank vial types:

  1. WCB_2 vials that were banked from cells expanded on planar cultureware
  2. WCB_2 vials that were banked from cells expanded in microcarrier culture

We want to compare their performance to test our hypothesis that the ones
grown previously in microcarrier culture will grow faster on microcarriers
after thaw.

There will be 4x culture conditions:

  1. Planar WCB_2 into diff assay
  2. Planar WCB_2 into microcarrier culture  

  3. Microcarrier WCB_2 into diff assay
  4. Microcarrier WCB_2 into microcarrier culture 

Diff assay, expansion on planar cultureware and expansion in microcarrier
culture will be performed as per normal protocols.

We should consider using poloxomer during our cell harvesting in this epic to
support our cell detachment from microcarriers.
