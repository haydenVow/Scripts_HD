### Process:

1\. Took 3 images of 2/5 cultures due for passage to assess confluence (100%
confluent).




4\. Removed vessel(s) from the incubator  

5\. Washed the vessel(s) with dPBS (room temp)

6\. Added     5    mL 1x Tryple-edta (room temp) to each vessel/well and
incubated at 30ËšC for 8 minutes,.  

7\. Neutralised with     10mL     dPBS and combined cell suspension into 1 x
50mL    tube.

8\. Centrifuged at 500 x g for 5 min.




9\. Aspirated the supernatant(s).

10\. Resuspended pellet(s) in     6    mL     dPBS     media.

11\. Aliquoted     20uL     of resuspended cells into a microcentrifuge tube
for cell count.

12\. Performed a cell count using the haemocytometer and recorded the cell
count data in the Google Doc spreadsheet: Cell Count Spreadsheet.

Total cell number was:    12,456,000  

Aliquoted 1.2mL of cell suspension (2.5x10^6 cells) into the pre warmed 60mL
aliquot of growth media.

Mixed the cell suspension and distributed it across 5xT75 flasks (12mL each,
375K cells per flask).

4 million cells were used in the experiment EPIC31347 CRISPR immortalisaiton
round 1. https://au-

* * *

Decided to seed some of the leftover cells into 4 wells of a 6 well plate,
each containing 3mL of growth media.

1.25x10^5 cells were seeded into two wells (60uL of cell suspension)

0.625x10^5 cells were seeded into two wells (30uL of cell suspension)

  

The remaining cell suspension was discarded.
