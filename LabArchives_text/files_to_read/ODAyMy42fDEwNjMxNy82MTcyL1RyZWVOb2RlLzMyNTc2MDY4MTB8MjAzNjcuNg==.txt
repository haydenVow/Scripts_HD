NOTE  
Due to the apparent arrest of cellular proliferation in our WALLE lines, it
was decided to trial various seeding and media conditions in an attempt to
kick-start these cultures.  WALLE06 will be used, as they have the healthiest
morphology of the 3 cell lines, and have the greatest number of these cells.
Conditions will be trialed as outlined bellow.

Process:

1\. Imaged each plate on 5,10 and 20x magnification.

2\. Aliquoted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then
placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath

  1. Tryple:    13  mL 
  2. dPBS (for washing and neutralising)   50  mL   
  3. Growth media (for seeding):
  4. aliquots  
50mlDMEM/F12 + 15% FBS + 1x P/S + 2mlfor cell count/resuspension  
25mLDMEM/F12 + 20% FBS + 1x P/S

  5. Times that all aliquots were placed in the water bath to warm before use   14:30



  1. Removed spent/conditioned media and retained in the water bath for later use in 50% conditioned media conditions. 
  2. Washed the flask(s) 3x with PBS 
  3. Added  10/5/3ml  for T175/T75/T25 respectively tryple to each vessel/well
  4. Incubated at 37ËšC for   15:22-15:57pm (35 min) min, checking regularly under the microscope to see if cells have detached  (>90%)  

  5. Neutralised with dPBS (warmed) and transferred cell suspension into a   50mL   tube/ culture.
  6. Centrifuged at 650 x g for 5 min 16:05  

  7. Aspirated the supernatant(s)\+ Resuspended pellet(s) in     2mL media  mL    DMEM/F12+15% FBS + 1x P/S  media
  8. Performed a cell count using the haemocytometer and recorded the cell count data in widget or the Google Doc spreadsheet called 'Cell Count Spreadsheet' (see link below):

Cell count for cell suspension was 1,430,000/ml= 2,860,000 cells in total

10\. Transfered cell suspension into  flasks/plates in respective medias
following table below. Replicates were not prepared for the 20% FBS media due
to a shortage of cells.
