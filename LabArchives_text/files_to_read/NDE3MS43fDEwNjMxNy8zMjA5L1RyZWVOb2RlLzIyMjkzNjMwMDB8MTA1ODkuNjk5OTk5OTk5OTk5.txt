Process:

Fixing ( ~ 20 - 30 min)

  1.  Removed media from each well and wash with PBS. 
  2.  Added  100 µL PFA for 15 min:  11:51 - 12:06 pm 
  3. Removed PFA (and add in PFA waste container) and wash wells with   140 µL PBS. 

  

Permeabilise ( ~ 20 - 30 min)

1\. Removed PBS from each well.

2\. Added  100 µL PBST (0.2% Triton-X) to each well for 15 min:  10:54 - 11:09
pm

3\. Aspirated PBST for each well.




Blocking ( ~ 1 hr)

1\. Added  100 µL of blocking buffer (3% BSA in PBST [0.1% Triton-X]) and
incubate for 45 minutes - 1hr at RT. (no more than 1 hour):   11:13 - 12:13
a/pm




Single/Simultaneous Primary Antibody staining ( ~ 10 minutes or 2hr)

1\. Removed blocking buffer from each well.

2\. Incubated cells with primary antibody for 90min - 2hrs at RT, or 4ºC
overnight:   12:11 - 13:41 a/pm

3\. Parafilmed plates and stored at 4ºC in tissue culture lab Fridge.

After this step, all further task should be performed in a dark room. The
vessel should also be wrapped foil when not used.




Observations/Summary:

  * ### 2 x  DSD Plates primary stained for MyoG and MF20
