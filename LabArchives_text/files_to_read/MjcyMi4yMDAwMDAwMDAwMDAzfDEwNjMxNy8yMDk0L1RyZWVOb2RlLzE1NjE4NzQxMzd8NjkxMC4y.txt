Process:

100% feed of 6 wells on 2 96 well plats. HS and E6 aliquots for the feeds
stored in fridge 104 with 'JARED' and 'EPIC16074' written on the side. 'SAT'
also written on the lid.  
The plates are stored on the top shelf of incubator 77.

1\. Aliquotted   1 mL  mL of E6 media into   1 x 15mL   tube and aliquotted
1 mL  mL of  HS media into   1 x 15mL tube. Stored in fridge 104.

2\. Placed both tubes in water bath  10:30 am

3\. Removed  100  % of diff media from vessel.

4\. Replaced with  150 uL (per well/per vessel) of  Diff   media. B2-B4
replaced with HS. C2-C4 replaced with E6 on both plates.

5\. Returned vessel to incubate at  11:14 am  

  * [X]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (aviary cells)

  

  * Incubator (#77 ), Lab [Library]
