B12 concentrations to try:  
  

\- Literature used 1M cells in suspension and added different conc of B12
(1ng, 5ng and 20ng B12 per 1M cells), so if we adapt this to our T175 platform
and seed densities we can calculate the B12 needed per mL of culture media for
each concentration.

\- 4xT175 seeded with F_CHOMP07 fibroblasts @7500 cells/cm2 = 1,312,500 cells
per T175 flask seeded.

Therefore, if we use the cell seed # as the basis of the B12 values, we need
1.3125 x 1ng, 5ng and 20ng per T175 flask upon seeding and on each media
change thereafter.

Total volume of GM per T175 flask to be used (in all flasks) = 30 mL

Conc # 1 = 1.3125 ng B12 per T175 flask (0.04375 ng/mL in this media stock -
rounded to 0.05 ng/mL) 75mL

Conc # 2 = 6.5625 ng B12 per T175 flask (0.21875 ng/mL in this media stock \-
rounded to 0.25 ng/mL) 75mL

Conc # 3 = 26.25 ng B12 per T175 flask (0.875 ng/mL in this media stock \-
rounded to 0.9 ng/mL) 75mL

Conc # 4 = 0 ng B12 per T175 flask (0 ng/mL in this media stock)

  

Notes on stock preparation of B12:

We need 90 ng B12 for this whole experiment. If we make up a stock of B12 that
is 1000,000x concentrated, we will be weighing in the mg range (a million
times more than we need). We cannot weigh ng accurately, so must make a way
more concentrated stock to draw from. A two-stage dilution process is required
due to the extremely small quantities of B12 needed.

Initial stock:

10 mg (0.01 g) weighed out and solubilised in 10 mL MilliQ water (1mg/mL stock
concentration). This is a 1,000,000 ng/mL stock.

Working stock:

Dilute the 1,000,000 ng/mL initial stock in plain DMEM/F12 to make the working
stock. Dilute 0.01 mL of initial stock in 9.990 mL DMEM/F12 (1 in 10,000
dilution) to make a working stock of 100 ng/mL

Amount required per group:

Conc # 1 = 1.3125 ng B12 per T175 flask (0.05 ng/mL) 75mL = 2000x dilution of
working stock (75/2000) = 0.0375mL into 74.9625mL complete GM

Conc # 2 = 6.5625 ng B12 per T175 flask (0.25 ng/mL) 75mL = 400x dilution of
working stock (75/400) = 0.1875mL into 74.8125mL complete GM

Conc # 3 = 26.25 ng B12 per T175 flask (0.9 ng/mL) 75mL = 111.11x dilution of
working stock (75/111.11) = 0.675mL into 74.325mL complete GM

Conc # 4 = 0 ng B12 per T175 flask (0 ng/mL in this media stock)
