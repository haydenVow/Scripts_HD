## Performed by: LL, BT, AK  




  * Due to lower than expected cell harvest, rows G & H and wells D5 & D7 are now serum and ACF Cell Free scaffolds, respectively (well G1 accidentally received some cell suspension so will be discounted) 




Seeding

Cell requirements

Average total cells in ACF suspension : (11200000+12200000)/2 = 11,700,000

Average total cells in serum suspension : (6950000+7350000)/2 = 7150000

Cell suspension required

NOTE: ideally wanted to seed @ 1M cells per scaffold, but our limiting factor
(serum-control cell count) meant that we are seeding @ 0.75M per scaffold  

Condition (ACF)   16   wells x    0.75M   cells =   ~12 M cells   : Total cell
suspension required:  total suspension   uL  

Condition (serum)   8   wells x    0.75M   cells =   ~6 M cells   : Total cell
suspension required:   remaining suspension after removing 804 uL  

24WP (serum)   24   wells x    47,916   cells =   1.15 M cells   : Total cell
suspension required:  804    uL  

  

Media requirements (pre-warmed)

Re-suspension of cell pellet:

(Note: typically between 50 - 60 uL of growth media for pellet re-suspension)

Total media required (condition   ACF   ):   16   well x    96WP   plate x
50 uL  growth media =     800 uL  
  
Total media required (condition   serum   ):  16   well x   96WP   plate x
50 uL growth media =     400 uL  
  
Total media required (condition   serum (24WP)  ):   24   well x    24WP
plate x   0.5 mL growth media =     12 mL  
  

Media top up :

(Note: typically between 210 - 230 uL of growth media for top up, however it
can be more or less depending on the size of the scaffold)

Total media required (condition   ACF  ):   16   wells x    96 well  plate x
0.180 mL growth media =     2.88  mL  
  
Total media required (condition  serum   ):   8   wells x    96 well  plate x
0.180  mL growth media =     1.44 mL




  

  1. Transfer the above volume of cell suspension into a 15 mL centrifuge tube
  2. Centrifuge at 650 x g for 5 minutes :    16:29     

  3. Aspirate supernatant 
  4. Resuspend cell pellet in the corresponding amounts of media. 
  5. Seed scaffold with 50 uL of cell suspension and allow to incubate in the BSC for 30 minutes    16:41   
  6. Top with 180 uL of media and transfer into incubator     17:00      




### Results:

  * Results were;
    * [ ]  As Usual (this is a repetitive task)
    * [x]  Unexpected because...expected more cells
    * [ ]  Need to be further analysed
    * [ ]  Other (.......)
