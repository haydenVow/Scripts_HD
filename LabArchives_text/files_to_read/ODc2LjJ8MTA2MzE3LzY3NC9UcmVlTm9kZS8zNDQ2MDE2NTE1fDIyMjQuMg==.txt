Process:

Growth media = DMEM/F12 + 20% FBS + 1x P/S + 10uM p38i  

  1. Using a multichannel pipette and disposable reservoir, gelatin coated column 2, 3 and 4 of 1x 96 well plate (excluding wells on the edges).
  2. Added 140uL/well of PBS to wells surrounding the gelatin coated wells. 
  3. Incubated plate at 37 degrees C, 5% CO2 for at least 1 hour 11:45
  4. Warmed 4mL of growth media in the waterbath 14:36
  5. Using cells from cell-expansion, made a cell suspension containing 200k cells in 4 mL total in a 70mL container.
    1. Lab book link to harvest from cell expansion: https://au-mynotebook.labarchives.com/share/Vow%2520-%2520Team%2520Science/MzkwLjB8MTA2MzE3LzMwMC9UcmVlTm9kZS8xMDMyMTczNTc5fDk5MC4w
  6. Used this cell suspension to seed gelatin coated wells of 96 well plate with 7000 cells/well in 140uL media/well.
  7. Incubated plate at 37 degrees C, 5% CO2. 17:25
