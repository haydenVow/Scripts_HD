## Performed by: Bonnie




Process:

  1. Observed cultures under the microscope, HORNO and HORNF were 100% confluent with varied cell morphologies, some with long projections. It was difficult to make out individual cells due to the high confluence. HORNK was 90% confluent with clear clusters of cells and branching, interconnecting projections between the clusters, appear to form modular networks. 
  2. Aliquoted reagents and placed in the cell culture incubator to warm >45 minutes prior to use: TrypLE:    20 ,Growth media (for pellet resuspension):    100   mL of each media
  3. Removed media from flasks 
  4. Washed with 10mL PBS to wash 
  5. Added 5mL Tryple to each flask and incubated at 37C for 10min 
  6. Added 5mL PBS to each flask, then transferred the mix to 50mL centrifuge tubes
  7. Centrifuged for 5 min at approx 500g. 
  8. Removed supernatant and resuspended cell pellets in 5mL of their respective growth media.
  9. Took 40ul aliquots from each tube to perform cell counts.
  10. Performed trypan blue counts for each culture and recoded in the cell count spreadsheet

CELL COUNTS  
HORNO- 10M  
HORNK- 12.6M  
HORNF- 16.5M

  11. Reseeded each culture into 2x T175 flasks, in 30mL per flask of their respective medias.
