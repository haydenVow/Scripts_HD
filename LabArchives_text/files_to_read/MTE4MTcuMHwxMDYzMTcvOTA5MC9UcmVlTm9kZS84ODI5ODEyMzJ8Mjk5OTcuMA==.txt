Main lab, top shaking incubator #159


Process
  
  
In the morning:

  1. Took 1 x 510 uL aliquot from each E500 and performed count on ViCell
  2. Recorded counts in media results spreadsheet: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1cnmEz5amKSGmA9u3BJ-Dn0w-I7zFobBr6pG-UWCYaXM/edit#gid=595130609
  3. Transferred 54.496 mL cell suspension from the combined cell suspension of 2 x E500 into each 2 x E500mL tubes (~60M per flask) 
  4. Added 150 mL of warmed 50/50 RPMI/CHO Nuvonis suspension medium + GFs (with 6g/L glucose and 4 mM L-glut) to flask to bring volume up to 200 mL in each E550 and cell seeding density to ~300K cells/mL 
  5. Returned flasks to incubator

  

In the afternoon:

  1.   

  2. After Media op weekly sync, seeded an extra 9 x E125 for EPIC31442. 
  3. Took 1 x 510 uL aliquot from each E500 and performed count on ViCell (Did not record these counts on the team media spreadsheet).
  4. Cell suspensions from flasks 13062 and 13063 were combined. 
  5. 348 mL of cell suspension containing a total of 60M cells were used to seed flasks 16-24 in EPIC31442.
  6. Seeded remaining 50mL of cell suspension containing 9M cells in a new E250.
  7. Returned flasks to the incubator.





Notes


Cell count is much lower than what expected based on calculations.

Performed an additional cell count of flask 13063 to seed flasks 16-24 for
EPIC 31442 and there were a total of about 34M cells rather than 60M (176K
cells/mL in 200mL of medium). Similarly, cell count of flask 13062 contained
about 34M cells (180K cells/mL in 200mL of medium). Cells look extremely
clumpy.
