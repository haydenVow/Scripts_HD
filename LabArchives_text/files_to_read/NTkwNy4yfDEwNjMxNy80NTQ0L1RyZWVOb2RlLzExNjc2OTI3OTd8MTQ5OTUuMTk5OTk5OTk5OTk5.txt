## Q3 2021 saw the development of a semi-automated suspension culture system,
enabling media changes, sampling, staining, imaging and counting of at least
72 cultures in 50 mL bioreactor tubes per day, as demonstrated by the
concurrent experiments EPIC24808 and EPIC24485.

Further improving this pipeline will enable us to test more conditions when
performing fast adaptation of cells to suspension. Furthermore, the same
platform could be used for media optimisation experiments once we have a
suspension adapted cell line.

## Therefore, turbocharging fast suspension adaptation is important for
achieving KR1 and KR4:

  * ## KR1: Develop a QMS-compliant serum-free media that supports 20+ doublings of our chosen species in suspension

  * ## KR4: Establish and run a suspension pipeline at a rate of 10,000 clones per month.
