  * AK first observed - Culture was completely cloudy. Sample checked under microscope and all cells dead. No contamination observed. 
    * RPMI/CHOin1 media is usually a light pink colour, this culture had turned to a cloudy/pale yellow
  * pH was measured for two draw samples: 7.46 and 7.43.
  * There was a definite smell coming from the culture

A post-mortem was performed over lunch to discuss what may have happened to
give this outcome and record all events up to this point. This document can be

Observations (2:00pm)

  * Later in the day black 'chunks' were observed in the bag and in the exhaust filter tubing. From this point onwards this culture was treated as contaminated.

Actions taken:

  * Sterile samples will be taken and sent away for contamination identification
    * 1 sample from STR2000 bag
    * 1 sample from base palletank bag
  * Belinda from Quantal was at the Vowse today and had a look at it for us. She said it doesn't look like an obvious fungus and if anything it would be more likely to be a bacterial contamination. 

* Due to the a lack of time and sterile equipment at 6pm on Friday it was decided to leave the bioreactor as is over the weekend (all functions were turned off). Jared was at the Vowse on Sunday and would check on the culture to see if anything had grown, if it has Claudia will come in and help him take sterile samples and disinfect the culture. If not this will be done on Monday.
