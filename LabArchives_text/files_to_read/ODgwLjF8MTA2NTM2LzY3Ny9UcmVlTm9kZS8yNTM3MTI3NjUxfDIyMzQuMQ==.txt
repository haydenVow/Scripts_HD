Batch 24 Overview

(CHOMP)

Total Batch Weight: 83.44g

Batch Objectives:

  * Produce as much CHOMP mass as possible and continue to compare 10CS/5CS vs Roller Bottles

### Original Batch 24 Plan:

  * Split the batch into 10CS/5CS and Roller bottles for P3 and produce as much mass as possible whilst testing the 2 flask types
  * Treat all 10CS/5CS with VitC ONLY (Best known treatment at this point in time, based off DOLLY)
  * Treat all Roller Bottles with TGFb + VitC

### Notable Events and Revised Batch 24 Plan:

  * CHOMP Fibroblasts were grown in 10% FBS for the first 8 days of P1 before realising they should be grown in 20% FBS at which point a 100% media change was performed and 20% FBS was used for the remainder of the batch
  * All 10CS in Batch 23 were also treated with VitC ONLY based off our knowledge of DOLLY.
    * This treatment was found to be the worst performing in CHOMP. Once this was realised (after 2 days of treatment with VitC ONLY) it was decided to change the treatment of Batch 24 10CS/5CS from VitC ONLY to TGFb + VitC which was found to give the best results in Batch 23
      * Batch 23 details can be found here https://au-mynotebook.labarchives.com/share/Vow%2520-%2520Team%2520Production/ODU5LjMwMDAwMDAwMDAwMDF8MTA2NTM2LzY2MS9UcmVlTm9kZS8yNDcwNDg2NTEzfDIxODEuMjk5OTk5OTk5OTk5Nw==
    * Due to a lack of time and media required, only a 50% media change was performed with switching these flasks from VitC ONLY treatment to VitC + TGFb treatment. Therefore, rather than a complete change, TGFb was gradually stepped in over the course of this batch with every subsequent 50% feed.
  * The Roller bottle treatment was unchanged as this was already on the optimal treatment identified in Batch 23.

### Batch Results:

  * Main takeaways:
    * VitC + TGFb is still the best treatment for 10CS/5CS
      * Even if the cells have been treated with VitC ONLY for up to 2 days, switching this treatment to TGFb + VitC will still result in a great yield similar to that of TGFb + VitC treatment from the start (see CHOMP vs DOLLY comparison below)
    * Roller bottles are still peeling earlier than expected resulting in a much lower yield than what can be achieved in 10CS/5CS per 1000cm2
      * Something other than treatment conditions needs to be tried to improve roller bottle yields

  
* Graph 1 shows the effect of different treatment types on the yield of CHOMP vs DOLLY fibroblasts from 10CS/5CS. This CHOMP data contains both Batch 23 and 24 and will be built upon with each successive Batch. Error bars display SEM

* Graph 2 shows the average pellet weight (g) per 1000cm2 in each flask type. Error bars display SEM  
* Graph 3 shows the days in culture and treatment time of each flask type

  

Achievements:

  * We saved this batch from being in the wrong treatment condition for too long by identifying the problem in batch 23 and rectifying it in batch 24. 
  * This change resulted in a great yield outcome for the 10CS/5CS
  * Produced the largest amount of mass from one batch to date!
