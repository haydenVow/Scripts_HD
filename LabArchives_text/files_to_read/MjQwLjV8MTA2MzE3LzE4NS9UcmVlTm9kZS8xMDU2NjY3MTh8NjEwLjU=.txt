Sample seeding:

  

On plate 1:

\- Seed n=4 scaffolds with 1M cells in 240ul of growth media, place plate
straight into incubator

\- Seed n = 2 wet scaffolds with 1M cells in 240ul of growth media, place
plate straight into incubator

  

1\. 4.918 ml was taken from the bulk suspension.

2\. Centrifuged at 650 x g for 5 min. Start/Finish time for centrifugation was
17:30 - 17:35

3\. Aspirated the supernatant.

4\. Resuspend pellet in 1440 ul of media (from 240 ul x 6 wells).

5. 

placed in incubator 18:02

  

  
On plate 2:

\- Seed n=4 dry scaffolds with 0.8M cells in 40ul on one side, wait 30min,
seed other side with 0.8M cells in 40ul and wait 30mins, add 160ul of growth
medium and place plate in incubator

\- Seed n = 2 wet scaffolds with 0.8M cells in 40ul on one side, wait 30min,
seed other side with 0.8M cells in 40ul and wait 30mins, add 160ul of growth
medium and place plate in incubator

WELLS = 8 + 6 + 6 (0.8 seeding) X 40 UL = 800 ul

Take 656 ul per well = 20 x 656 ul = 13.120 ml

spin down 13120 ul, 1726 remove top and resus with 800 ul

deposited on one side 15:45

deposited on second side 18:15

\- n=4 cell free scaffolds

add 240ul of media to each well 18:25

160 ul put onto samples 18:45

placed in incubator 18:50
