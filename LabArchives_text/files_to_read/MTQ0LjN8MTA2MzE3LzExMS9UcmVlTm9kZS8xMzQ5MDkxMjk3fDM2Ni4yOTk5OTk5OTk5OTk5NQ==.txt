Calibrate the pH probeGather 2 reference buffers (perferably pH 7 and pH 10)
in small beakers, a wash bottle, and a spare wash beaker. Connect the pH probe
up to the control tower. Run the pH calibration program. Wash the probe tip
thoroughly with deionized water and wipe with a lint-free wipe before placing
it in the reference buffers.Operating manual page(s) 43,67

Prepare the adjustment agent bottlesNot all corrective reagents can be
sterilized in the autoclave. Instead of adding these kind of adjustment agents
(ammonia solution, etc.), fill those with water and, after autoclaving (in a
sterile work cabinet) replace the water with a filter-sterilized corrective
reagent. This also applies to many substrate feeds, which can caramelize if
heated.https://www.infors-ht.com/en/blog/how-to-set-up-a-bioreactor/

-1SetupTransport the sterile bioreactor vessel to the work benchOnce the autoclaving chamber has cooled to 60-70 deg C, open the chamber and check connections to make sure that all vessels remain sealed. In the event that any tubing has popped off, rinse connections with 70% ethanol and reconnect; or, re-autoclave the entire assembly. Use a trolley to transport the assembly to the work bench.
