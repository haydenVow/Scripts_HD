# Procedure

Number of Aliquots x Growth Media Volume

Vitamin C & TGF-b1 added  
(Y/N)  
  
26 x 750mL  
Added at 10:00am Y  
  
  
Warmed to 37C in Waterbath  
  
Time Placed In

9:00am  
  
  
Time Taken Out

11:00am  
  
  
Media Change (%)

Amount x Flask Type

Volume Aspirated per Flask

Volume Replaced per Flask  
  
100%  
13 x 10 CF  
1.5L  
1.5L media + 50ug/mL Vit C + 5ng/mL TGF-b1  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  

  

  1. Turn on the water bath and set to 37'C.
  2. Aliquot  required growth media into a sterile container/s and add:  
    i) Vitamin C (aka LAA2P) [stock concentration 100mg/mL] to a working concentration of 50ug/mL in growth media i.e. 500uL per 1L of media.  
   ii) TGF-b1 [stock concentration 0.002mg/L] to a working concentration of
10ng/mL in growth media i.e. 5mL per 1L of media.  
NOTE: Due to shortage of TGF-b1, only half the concentration was used on all
flasks. Vit C treatment concentration remained the same.

  3. Place in the water bath and heat for at least 20 minutes.
  4. Observe the cell flasks for confluence under the microscope using 4 x magnification and take images as required. 
  5. Transfer flasks to the BSC and remove required volume of media from each flask (according to the Table above).
  6. Replace the same volume into each flask with the prepared growth media.
  7. Return the flasks to the incubator.  
`    Time of incubation`: 12:00pm  

Incubation Conditions:

        [x]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)  
        [  ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (avian cells)

Incubator:  
        [ x]  Top Left Binder Incubator  
        [ x]  Bottom Left Binder Incubator  
        [ x]  Top Right Binder Incubator  
        [ x]  Bottom Right Binder Incubator
