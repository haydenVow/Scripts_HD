## 1\. Background

TGF-B1 is a growth factor that plays a role in maintaining stem cell and
tissue homeostasis. It is a key ingredient in our E8 and ACF growth media. It
is also beneficial to endothelial cells, and is therefore added to their
growth media.

## 3\. Safety

The preparation of TGF-B1 aliquots is to be performed in a Biological Safety
Cabinet. General lab PPE is required, including face mask, hair net, gloves,
and lab coat.

  4. TGF-B1 stock powder 
  5. Sterile falcon tubes 
  6. 1 x syringe filter unit 
  7. Steile microtubes 




## 6\. Method/Procedure (suitable for Peprotech CAT #100-21C)

Note: Please perform this procedure with the BSC light turned off. Growth
factors are often sensitive to light exposure.  

  1. Calculate the volume of 0.5% albumin (v/v) in dPBS solution required to create a 0.002 mg/mL stock solution of TGF-B1. 
  2. Prepare the solution of 0.5% albumin in sterile dPBS in a sterile falcon tube in the BSC. 
  3. Retrieve stock powder from storage location (TGF-B1 powder is kept at -20 degrees C).
  4. Using a microfuge, centrifuge the vial containing TGF-B1 powder for 30 seconds and then transfer the vial to the BSC.
  5. Using a micropipette, transfer sterile MilliQ water from the falcon tube to the stock vial to reconstitute the powder to a concentration of 1.0 mg/mL. Pipette mix thoroughly and smoothly to dissolve the stock powder, taking care not to spill any of the solution. 
  6. Transfer the entire aliquot back to the falcon tube containing 0.5% albumin in dPBS. Repeat steps 5 - 6 twice more, washing with 0.5% albumin solution to ensure that the entire amount of powder is dissolved.
  7. Check the vial to ensure that no powder is left. If any powder remains, repeat step 8 until the vial is clean.
  8. Using a serological pipette, carefully mix the solution to ensure a homogenous mix (do not vortex!) 
  9. Pour or pipette solution into a syringe filter unit and filter into a new sterile falcon tube.
  10. Transfer the solution into sterile microtubes. Remember to add at least 5 uL to your desired aliquot volume to account for loss of liquid from pipetting. 
  11. Enter details in Stockyard V2 under "Create Mix".
  12. Place aliquots into an appropriately sized container (e.g. cryobox, 500 mL sterile pot) and stick Stockyard label on the container. Add a note of the volume per aliquot for future users. 
  13. Store in - 20 degrees C freezer.
