Equilibrate microcarriers in culture medium before use

  1.  
  2. Prior to use, aliquotted | 13.5 | mL of sterilized microcarriers ( 20 g/L stock) suspended in dPBS into | 1  |  x |  E250 | tubes/containers/flasks
  3. Rinsed microcarriers in | 13.5 | mL culture medium (50 mL/g Cytodex). (this rinse reduces dilution of the culture medium by PBS trapped between and within the microcarriers, which is particularly important when using small culture volumes or cells with low plating efficiencies).
  4. The microcarriers were then allowed to settle and as much supernatant as possible was removed.
  5. The microcarriers were resuspended to the desired volume of culture medium ( | 60 | mL ). 
  6. The culture vessel was transferred to the incubator for at least 1 hour or overnight so that the microcarriers and culture medium could equilibrate. |   12:10pm   am/pm | 
    * 37 degrees, 5% CO2, Incubator #  | 68  |  

NOTE: One E250 had been previously equilibrated on the 13-May for EPIC16072.

## Trypan blue staining post harvest

  1. [15:35]: outside of the BSC harvested microcarriers in dPBS were swirled vigorously by hand to resuspend carriers and any free floating cells.
  2. 20uL of the media inside the flask was transferred to a 1.5mL tube and mixed 1:1 with trypan blue
  3. Performed a cell count using the haemocytometer and recorded the cell count data in the Google Doc spreadsheet called 'Cell Count Spreadsheet' (see link https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1DPzKubYxfHmWogVPihC-SSIBtIylyrBQE5kRX5Z8NtI/edit#gid=0&range=1102:1102) 
  4. The total volume of harvested microcarriers remaining in dPBS in the flask was measured using a P50 serological. (34mL) 
  5. The total number of estimated cells remaining in the free floating dPBS after harvest was roughly 680,000 cells.

Observations/Summary:

  * 1% w/v poloxamer 188 was used during trypsin detachment 
  * 0.22W/kg energy dissipation rate was used for the harvest. 
  * 1% w/v poloxamer was used during the neutralization media and washes post harvest.
  * Increased shaking time to 10 minutes instead of 7 based on previous harvesting observations from EPIC16072
  * Trypan blue staining of cells remaining in dPBS supernatant post harvest revealed that were was still a large population of cells remaining in the dPBS solution. It is possible that during microcarrier sedimentation, this population of cells is becoming trapped in the carrier pellet and therefore is repeadily inaccessible during supernatant collection at all points during post trypsinisation.

Stained and imaged cells adhered to microcarriers

  1. Removed culture(s) from the incubator and placed them in the BSC .
  2. Swirled culture(s) by hand on the flat surface of the BSC for 5 seconds, the lid was quickly removed and 5 x 20uL samples of the suspension were taken while the liquid was still in motion. This ensures the carriers were evenly mixed at time of sampling.
  3. Transferred the aliquot(s) to 5 wells on a 96 well plate and mixed it with 80uL of dPBS.
  4. Returned cultures to the incubator.
  5. Added 2uL of Hoechst 33342 to each of the 5 wells.
  6. Left the 96 well plate to incubate at room temperature, in the dark (away from light), for 15 minutes.  
  7. After incubation the wells were inspected under the Axio microscope, 5x objective.
  8. Using https://mia-capture.vow.tools/#/, 3 sets of same frame images using the DAPI and PHASE channels were captured for each well 
    1. Manually set the exposure time for DAPI channel to the exposure time seen when carriers are viewed using the automatic exposure adjustment. (i.e if automatic exposure adjustment reads 0.002ms, set manual adjustment exposure time to be 0.002ms. 
    2. Fluorescence intensity of the UV lamp was adjusted until the centre of each microcarrier was barely visible compared to the space between microcarriers.
