Protocol

  1. Remove vessels from box. Keep the optical patch data on the sheet insert. Note which sheet pertains to which reactor if using x3 or more reactors. 
  2. Wipe vessels with EtOH and bring into BSC. Remove outer plastic wrapping and seal all clamps and reservoir lids
  3. Prepare media with antifoam but without growth factors and add to vessels via the liquid handler port
  4. Typically use 200mL total in each vessel with inoculum as 20% -> equal to 180mL in vessel for hydration and 20mL inoculum added to bring to 200mL total
  5. Ensure all ports and clamps are sealed and remove from BSC
  6. Store in hardware overnight or over weekend

  
Deviations & notesAF has not been added to the media and base has not been
added to the second liquid chamber.

Base (sodium carbonate)  
  
  
  
  

Added 180 mL of GM to each of the main chambers in 4 x AMBR vessels (720 mL
total)

Added 20 mL of GM to the first reservoir of each vessel (80 mL total)

Did not add AF or base to the chamber / reservoirs.

Cell requirements for Monday (27/06/22)

4 x 200 mL (4 x BRs) + 2 x 30 mL (2 x SFs)

= 860 mL total cell suspension volume @ 200k c/mL

= 172M cells needed

  

Chose the best performing flask from Stock A (A1) and Stock B (B1). Discarded
~70 mL of cell suspension from each selected flask and added 70 mL of fresh
1:1 RPMI:CHOin1 supplemented with IGF and EGF. Final seeding density of each
flask = ~250-300k c/mL (total number of flasks after the passage = 2).

Total volume of each E500 = ~140 mL
