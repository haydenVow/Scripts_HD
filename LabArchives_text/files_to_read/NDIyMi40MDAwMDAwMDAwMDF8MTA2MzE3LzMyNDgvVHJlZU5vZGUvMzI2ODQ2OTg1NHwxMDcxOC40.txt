Observations/Summary:

- Chris pointed out that one of the Condition 14 wells were low and hence Condition 14 was made up from scratch using the quantities of working stocks outlined in the spreadsheet. Working stocks were made up from scratch for factors 1, 2, 6, 8, 9, 11 and 12. Working stocks were mixed manually as per the spreadsheet to make Condition 14 which was then sterile filtered and then added the well B5 of Block 2 of the media.
