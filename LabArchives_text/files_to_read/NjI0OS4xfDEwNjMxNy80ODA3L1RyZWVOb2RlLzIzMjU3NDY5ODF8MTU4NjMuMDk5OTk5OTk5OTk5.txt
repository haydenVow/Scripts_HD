Process:

  1. Warm up pre-aliquotted  E6 Media  in 24w plate ( 2 mL per well approx) and the additional 10mL aliquot for plate 2 (with 4 cups inserts only)
  2. Placed tube in waterbath and plate in incubator for > 30min at   12:08     

  3. Removed sample plates from the incubator and place in BSC (lights off)
  4. transferred feed aplate and additional aliquot into BSC.
  5. Remove parafilm from feed and sample plate. 
  6. For main inserts plate: Transferred all inserts and buckets to fresh media plate using sterile tweezers
  7. For 4 "buckets of meatballs": 
    1. prefill an available set of 4 wells on same plate with 2 mL fresh E6 each 
    2.  transfer buckets to new well
    3.  removed old media to waste
  8. Parafilmed sample plates and returned vessel to incubate at:      13: 10  

  * [X]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (avian cells)

  

  * Incubator ( XXX ), Lab [Main/Library/Production]




### Observations/Summary:

 100 % media changed on vessel(s)

media yellow in all cell-containing samples, but clear graduation scaling with
cell density from 30M to 10M. Meatballs also yellow (some images taken also
with Hoechst Stain and some cells light up, however, imaging hard through
thick scaffolds
