1\. Weigh out RPMI:CHO-in-1 powder according to this spreadsheet.

2\. Store at 4'C until required for hydration.




Hydrating the growth medium:

1\. Cleaned the mixing tank first by pumping in 30L of ID water and 2% m(w/v)
of adcip.

2\. Turn on the recirc pump and leave it running for a minimum of 10 mins.
Pump the waste into the waste drain.

3\. Add 180L worth of ID water into the tank.

4\. Add all the powders directly into the tank with the stirrer on.

5\. Switch on the recirc pump to circulate the medium for at least 20 mins.

6\. Periodically sample the media from the sample port for any undissolved
reagents. Continue recirculating until all the powders are dissolved.

7\. Once dissolved switch off the recirc pump and leave the stirrer running.

8\. The media can now be added to the bag or palletank bag.




Filtering the growth media into a 200L palletank bag for storage

1\. Install a 200L palletank into one of the stainless steel housing units.

2\. Autoclave a length of tubing in the following configuration:

a. A length of 3/8" \- 5/8" advantaflex tubing with a male MPC connector on
one end. Include a male NPC cap in the autoclave bag, but do not connect it to
the ending.

b. Autoclave at 121'C for 20 minutes

3\. Transfer a 6-inch filter (Cat #: KMP-SG9206HH, ranger ID: STK-6739), and
the autoclaved tubing into a BSC

4\. Connect the sterile filter side to the autoclaved tubing (the non MPC end)
and secured into place with a cable tie

5\. Weld the sterile filter tubing to the palletank bag inlet line using the
Biowelder

6\. Attach the mixing tank outlet to the non-sterile end of the filter and
connect the tubing into a peristaltic pump

7\. Turn on the pump at 195.4 RPM to begin filtering the media into the
palletank bag

8\. Once all the media has been filtered, seal the tubing on the sterile end
of the filter and discard the filter

9\. Clean the mixing tank by pumping in 30L of ID water and 2% adcip (w/v)

10\. Turn on the recirc pump and leave it running for a minimum of 10 mins.
Pump the waste into the waste drain.

11\. Repeat the two previous steps, this time with the sanitiser

12\. Wash the tank with a final wash of just ID water and discard down the
waste line
