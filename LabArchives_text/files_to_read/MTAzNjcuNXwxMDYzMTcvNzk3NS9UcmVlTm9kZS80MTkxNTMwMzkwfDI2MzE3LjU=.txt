Aim/Purpose


To adapt Nuvonis suspension cells to grow in medium containing 100% HEK/CHO HD
media or 90:10 RPMI:HEK/CHO HD media.


Hypothesis


Given HEK and CHO are high density media, we hypothesise that Nuvonis
suspension cells will reach a comparable growth rate to that obtained in 100%
Freestyle 293 media and/or 90:10 RPMI:Hycell CHO.
