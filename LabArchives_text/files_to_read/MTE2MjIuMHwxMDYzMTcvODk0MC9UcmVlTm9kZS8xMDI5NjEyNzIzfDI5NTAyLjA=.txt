Took samples

  1. Unscrewed the "BENCHMARK" sample tube cover.
  2. Sprayed down the tube end with 70% ethanol.
  3. Connected a 5 mL sterile syringe.
  4. Withdrew slightly more than 3 mL (to purge the line).
  5. Discarded the 5 mL syringe.
  6. Connected a fresh sterile syringe and withdrew 3.5 - 4.0 mL of sample.
  7. Disconnected sample syringe and transferred 1 mL of sample each to 3 x 1.5 mL Eppendorf tubes for subsequent analysis:
    * Performed ViCell count:
    * Performed manual cell count: 
    * Tested pH offline: 
    * Prepared sample for offline biochemistry analyses: 
      * 250uL taken from sample
      * diluted 1:2 with equal volume of dH2O (not PBS) 
      * Quick spin for 1 minute
      * Reserve supernatant in new 1.5mL tube and discarded pellet. Input sample info into datasheet here for later analysis offsite. Stored in sample box at -20degC
  8. Sprayed sample tube end and cap with 70% ethanol, re-attached cap.

NotesRecorded relevant offline data measurements here  
  
Claudia cell performed manual cell count only. No additional
monitoring/measurements taken.  
  
VP taken x2 manual cell counts (see cell counting spreadsheet):

  * 104k/mL average total with 86k/mL dead -> 17% viability. Note, these samples were on the bench for ~20 mins before manual cell count
  * 79 300/mL 80% viability by ViCell count
  * 7.66 pH offline (Hanna instruments bench pH meter, calibrated before use)

  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  




Troubleshooting

Green indicates parameter is OK and ruled out.

Red indicates parameter out of spec or potential source of fault  

  

is the pH in spec?

  * Does online pH measurement match offline?
    * pH offline: 7.66 
    * pH online: 7.50
  * if not a match, could be problem with new probe
    * pH offline matches online pH +- ~0.1
  * check to see if there is enough base available in bottle. Make more and autoclave as back up (42g in 500mL)
    * ~200mL base remaining
  * check base addition over time in data logger
    * not able to visualise in 2L STR data logger
  * check pH online reading over time - does it look like dud data feeding into a base control loop?
    * can see logged changes in pH over the last 1h (changed the sparging rate in the last hour - this checks out)

  
Do the cells have enough oxygen?

  * current dO: 76% this is in spec (have seen cells proliferate between 50-100%, >70% ideal)
  * vvm should be 0.03-0.1 vvm = rate of 60-200 mL/min ~~~~
  * check gassing - cascade or fixed? Is cascade mode
  *  ~~If Fixed:~~
    *  ~~Current vvm and rate (if fixed):  ~~
  * If Cascade:
    * dO set point: 50%
    * Air for dO loop outputs:
      * 0% = 2 mL/min (far less than 0.03 vvm?)
      * 20 = 40
      * 40 = 80
      * 60 = 120
      * 80 = 160 
      * 100 = 200mL/min (0.1 vvm)  
  

Is the stirring speed too high?

  * Is this fixed or on dO loop?
    * on dO loop
  * 237 RPM current, is equivalent of ~0.68m/s tip speed. This should be within working range
  * STIRR for dO loop outputs are all within spec

Is there something added to or missing from the media?

  * is something missing from the media or too high?
  * mix components used for draw and fill given below. Nothing missing

  * growth factors, antifoam and L-glutamine added during draw and fill as per lab archives records and not double dosed   
  

Were the cells actually sick before now? Health of the cells during culture:

  * day 3:
    * 244k cells/mL, 97% viability by ViCell. No manual cell count taken
  * day 5:
    * 320k live cells/mL, 90.7% viability by ViCell
    * 280k live cells/mL, 62% viability by manual count
    * large discrepancy in viability here \- cells appear unhealthy here
    * 50% draw and fill performed 
  * day 7:
    * 79 300/mL 80% viability
    * 100k/mL ~60% viability manual count
  * Overall: cells may have been unhealthy at start of culture or at draw and fill.

  

Actions:

  *  increased the minimal sparging in dO control loop: 2 mL/min at 0% -> 20mL/min at 0%
  * watch and wait until Sunday
  * unlikely cells will be ready on Monday for draw and fill




### Observations/Summary:

  * 100kcells/mL cell count
  * Viability of ~60% 
  * the cells themselves also look quite swollen
  * Claudia is not point on this and insufficient time/hands in the lab to properly troubleshoot
  * Victoria P will visit lab later this evening to troubleshoot - see troubleshooting entry for details
    * Troubleshooting outcome: increased minimal air sparging. Watch and wait until next week. Next monitor on Sunday 18/07/22
