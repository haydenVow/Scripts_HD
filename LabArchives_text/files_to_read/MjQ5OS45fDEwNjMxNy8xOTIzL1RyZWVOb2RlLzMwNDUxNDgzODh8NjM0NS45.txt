Aim: To replicate/validate the equilibration time for pH and DO values in the
bioreactor vessel.

Preparation:

  1. Spare growth media from Production was used. This included 750mL of Phenol-red containing Growth Media (10% FBS) and 750mL of PRF Growth Media (20% FBS). It was decided that in order to mimic our growth conditions as much as possible, 750mL of media containing 20% FBS would be used first and then topped up with 10% FBS containing media until desired volume for probe submersion was achieved.
  2. 750mL of each media type was used to make up the 1.5L of media inside Wash-E.
  3. All 1.5L of media was used to make total working volume of 1.5L inside Wash-E
  4. Lid of Wash-E was closed and all probes attached.
  5. Medium was allowed to come to 37.4 degrees temperature.

Learnings:

Upon presenting data at science showcase, Tom pointed out that the relative
value of the rotameter for both gases DOES NOT correspond to the ratio of
respective gas molecules being sparged into the culture medium. Hence,
previous work is not characterising the intended ratios but rather unknown
ratios which will have to be calculated.
