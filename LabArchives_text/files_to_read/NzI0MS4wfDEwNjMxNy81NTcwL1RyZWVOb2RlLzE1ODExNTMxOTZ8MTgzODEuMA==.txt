Process

  1. Aliquoted 6mL of DMEM/F12 +15% FBS + 1 xP/S media and placed in the water bath 13:15
  2. Culture vessels removed from the incubator 13:20
  3. Each vessel was examined under the microscope and imaged at 10x and 20x magnifications. Observations were recorded in the table bellow.  

  4. Added an additional 1.5mL of pre-warmed media to the existing 3mL of media in each well (without discarding any of the spent media)  

  5. Culture vessels returned to library lab incubator #77 at 37C and 5% CO2 13:35

In all cultures, the isolate is clear with very little dibris and no signs of
contamination. While there are no cells with a the flattened, elongated
morphology typical of fibroblast cells, some rounded cells do appear to be
loosely attached to the vessel in all cultures.
