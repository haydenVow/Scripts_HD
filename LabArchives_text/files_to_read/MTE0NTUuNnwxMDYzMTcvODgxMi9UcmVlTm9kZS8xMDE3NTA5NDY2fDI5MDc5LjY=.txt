Decontaminated bioreactor

  1. Added 100 mL of 70% ethanol to the feed, seed, microcarrier and harvest bottles
  2. Pumped the 70% ethanol through the tubing and into the bioreactor
  3. Pumped the remaining base from the base bottle into the bioreactor
  4. Cut off the tip of the sampling tube and discarded.
  5. Pumped 50 mL of 70% ethanol back through the sample tube.
  6. Disconnected and removed the pH probe:
    1. Wiped with 70% ethanol
    2. Rinsed with water
    3. Wiped with a lint-free cloth
    4. Filled the storage cap with3.5 M KCl
    5. Replaced the storage cap and stored the probe upright
  7. Disconnected and removed the DO probe:
    1. Wiped with 70% ethanol
    2. Rinsed with water
    3. Wiped with a lint-free cloth
    4. Filled the storage cap with tap water
    5. Replaced the storage cap and stored the probe upright
  8. Disconnected and removed the level probe:
    1. Wiped with 70% ethanol
    2. Rinsed with water
    3. Wiped with a lint-free cloth
    4. Stored the probe in a thickly-padded foam box
  9. Pumped the contents of the bioreactor into the waste bottle.
  10. Clamped all of the dip-tube lines
  11. Added bleach to the wate bottle to a final concentration of 5 g/L sodium hypochlorite (0.5% w/v)

Cleaned the bioreactor vessel

  1. Added pH neutral, non-corrosive, bacteriostatic cleaning agent to the bioreactor, filling all the way to the headplate.
    1. Add 20 mL of Sonidet detergent to 4 L of tap water
    2. Open the headplate
    3. Pour the water-detergent mix into the bioreactor
    4. Replace the headplate
    5. The level should reach the bottom of the headplate
  2. Left the stirrer on at 360 RPM for 1 hour.
