Equilibrate microcarriers in culture medium before use

E125 equilibration

  1. Prior to use, aliquotted | 6.75 | mL of sterilized microcarriers ( 20 g/L stock) suspended in dPBS into |3   |  x | E125  | tubes/containers/flasks (135mg) 
  2. Rinsed microcarriers in | 6.75 | mL culture medium (50 mL/g Cytodex). (this rinse reduces dilution of the culture medium by PBS trapped between and within the microcarriers, which is particularly important when using small culture volumes or cells with low plating efficiencies).
  3. The microcarriers were then allowed to settle and as much supernatant as possible was removed.
  4. The microcarriers were resuspended to the desired volume of culture medium ( | 30 | mL ). 
  5. The culture vessel was transferred to the incubator for at least 1 hour or overnight so that the microcarriers and culture medium could equilibrate. |   13:32   am/pm | 
    * 37 degrees, 5% CO2, Incubator #  | Top sanyo, main lab)  | 

50mL bioreactor tube equilibration

  1. Prior to use, aliquotted | 2.25 | mL of sterilized microcarriers ( 20 g/L stock) suspended in dPBS into |  3  |  x | 50mL  | bioreactor tubes (45mg) 
  2. Rinsed microcarriers in | 2.25 | mL culture medium (50 mL/g Cytodex). (this rinse reduces dilution of the culture medium by PBS trapped between and within the microcarriers, which is particularly important when using small culture volumes or cells with low plating efficiencies).
  3. The microcarriers were then allowed to settle and as much supernatant as possible was removed.
  4. The microcarriers were resuspended to the desired volume of culture medium ( | 10 | mL ). 
  5. The culture vessel was transferred to the incubator for at least 1 hour or overnight so that the microcarriers and culture medium could equilibrate. |  13 32:   am/pm | 
    * 37 degrees, 5% CO2, Incubator #  |  Top sanyo, main lab |
