Perform thaw using below volumes:

  

  

  *  Growth media (for seeding):   30mL   
  

  * Growth Media:
    * [ ]  DMEM + 10% FBS + 1X P/S

1955-Culture-4713-Vial-1of6: Brew, Tower 3, Box 2.




## Thaw and seed vial:

1\. Pre-filled 1T175 flask with 30mL of growth media and placed in incubator
(to equilibrate media pH prior to seeding) 13:00

2\. Aliquoted 1mL growth media (for resuspension) and placed in water bath
14:00

3\. Collected the cryovial from Liquid Nitrogen storage & place in foam
floater in water bath for 5 min  14:10-14:15  

Vial details:   1  cryovial at   1M  cells each for a total of   1M cells

Brew

Tower/Bucket # 3  

Box/Cane # 2

Vial location: D1  

Vial ID(s): 1955  

`4. Ethanol sprayed & transferred the vial(s) to the BSC.`

``

`5.  Added  500µL of Growth Media (to generate a total volume of 1mL in the
cryovial) to the cryovial, resuspended the cell suspension gently to reduce
osmotic shock. `

`6. Collected the entire 1mL of cell suspension & transfer into the pre-warmed
T175 of Growth Media. `

`8. Using a 10mL serological pipette, resuspended & distributed the cells
evenly. ``  
`

`9. Transfered flask/plate(s) to incubate at: 14:19`

  1. [ x]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)

Making labels

Note - You will need to increase the passage number by one. (i.e. if your
thawed vial ID has a passage number of 3, when you make a culture ID for you
vessel you will need change the passage number to 4 on Airtable.)
