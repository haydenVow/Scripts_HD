1\. Prepared    1mL  PBST (0.2% Triton-X)

2\. Prepared    1mL  blocking buffer: PBST (0.1% Triton-X + PBS) + 3% bovine
serum albumin (BSA). (Kept in the fridge until needed in blocking step)

3\. Prepared Primary Antibody Mix: :  5 µL   MyoD (   (1:200  ) +  0.995  mL
Blocking Buffer

Pipette-mixed antibody mix and stored refrigerated away from light until
needed.

Process:

Permeabilise

1\. Removed plate from the fridge under the zaber in the library lab. Removed
PBS from each well.

2\. Added  100 µL PBST (0.2% Triton-X) to each well for 15 min:  10:34 - 10:49

3\. Aspirated PBST for each well.




Blocking

1\. Added  100 µL of blocking buffer (3% BSA in PBST [0.1% Triton-X]) and
incubate for 45 minutes:  10:51 - 11:36




Single/Simultaneous Primary Antibody staining

1\. Removed blocking buffer from each well.

2\. Incubated cells with primary antibody at 4ºC for 90 minutes at RT:   11:40
- 13:12  

3\. Parafilmed plates and stored at 4ºC in tissue culture lab Fridge.

After this step, all further task should be performed in a dark room. The
vessel should also be wrapped foil when not used.
