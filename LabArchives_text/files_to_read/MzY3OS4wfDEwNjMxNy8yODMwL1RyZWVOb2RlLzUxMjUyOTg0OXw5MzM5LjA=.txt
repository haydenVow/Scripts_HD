Prepare materials for thaw and seed:

1\. Gelatin coated  10  x  T175  flasks/plates with sterile filtered 0.1%
gelatin solution and then incubated all coated flasks at 37ºC

  * Time when all flasks placed into the incubator   15:28 pm 

2\. Aliquotted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then
placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath for a minimum of 20 minutes
prior to use:

  *  Growth media (for seeding):    300 mL in  500 mL  tubes 
  * p38i: 150 uL into growth media
  * Time that aliquot was placed in the water bath to warm before use:   15:43 pm 

  




## Thaw and seed vial:

  1. Collected the cryovial from Liquid Nitrogen storage & place in foam floater in water bath for 5 min  16:22 - 16:27 pm 
  2. Location where cryovial was collected from: 

Vial details:  3   x  DOLLY12  WCB cryovials at   540K  cells each for a total
of    1620K  cells

` `

  1. `Ethanol sprayed & transferred the vial(s) to the BSC.`
  2. `Added 500 µL of Growth media (to generate a total volume of 1 mL in the cyrovial) to the cyrovial, reuspended the cell suspension gently to reduce osmotic shock. `
  3. `Collected the entire 1 mL of cell suspension and transfer into the prewarmed tube of growth media. `
  4. `Using a serological pipette, resuspend and distribute the cells evenly in the   300 mL of pre-warmed Growth media. `
  5. `Transfered   30 mL to each pre-coated  T175 flask, allow to rest in the BSC at RT for 30 minutes  16:37 - 17:07 pm ```
  6. `Transfered flask/plate(s) to incubate at: `

  * [X]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells) THERMO
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (aviary cells)

  

Making labels

Note - You will need to increase the passage number by one. (i.e. if your
thawed vial ID has a passage number of 3, when you make a culture ID for you
vessel you will need change the passage number to 4 on Airtable.)
