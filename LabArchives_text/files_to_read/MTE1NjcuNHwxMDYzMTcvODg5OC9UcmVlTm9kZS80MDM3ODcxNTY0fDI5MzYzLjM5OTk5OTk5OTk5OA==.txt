## Performed by: Bonnie




Observations/Summary:

Due to the difference in morphology of the cells between cultures, they were
not combined.

Process:

Aliquoted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then
placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath 30 minutes prior to use

  1. Obsereved cultures under the microscope and recorded confluence in the table above. 
  2. Imaged cultures (captured in mia)
  3. TrypLE:   15    mL 
  4. dPBS (for washing & neutralising)   30   mL
  5. Growth media (for pellet resuspension and seeding):    200mL OptiPRO + 4mM Glutamax  
  6. Washed the flask(s) with dPBS.
  7. Added   10mL (T175) or 5mL (T75)  tryple to each vessel/well and incubated at 37˚C for   10     min.
  8. Neutralised with   10mL    dPBS (warmed) and combined cell suspension into a     50ml  tubes.
  9. Centrifuged at 500 x g for 10 min.
  10. Aspirated+ discarded supernatant
  11. Resuspended pellet(s) in      5 mL media.  
Performed a cell count using the haemocytometer and recorded the cell count
data in widget or the Google Doc spreadsheet called 'Cell Count Spreadsheet'
(see link below):

  12. Total cell number was:  
DUCKEYE CULTURE 12833 : 1,560,000  
DUCKEYE CULture 12768 : 1,340,000

  13. Re-seeded cells as per table above.

  14. Transferred flasks to incubate at 37ºC, 5% CO2, library lab incubator #77
