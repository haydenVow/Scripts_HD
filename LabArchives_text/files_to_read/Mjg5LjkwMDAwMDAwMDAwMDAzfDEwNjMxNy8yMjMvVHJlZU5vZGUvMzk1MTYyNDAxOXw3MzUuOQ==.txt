Thursday 22APR21:

Seed Fibroblasts on Zein scaffolds (800,000 cells / scaffold) (12 samples
total, 9.6M cells needed)

NOTE - When seeding make up at least 3 samples worth of excess cell sup, so as
not to run low and run out when seeding final scaffolds (common)  
Let's get a cell count and then see if there are enough cells to do this*

  

Harvest fibroblasts as per usual passaging technique until cell count.

Aliquot 10mL of Growth media with 50ug/mL L-ascorbic acid.

Aliquot 10mL of Growth media without L-ascorbic acid.

  1. Prepare 4.8M cells in 300uL Growth Media (without L-ascorbic acid) (Not sure if this is possible, prepare 5M cell pellet and measure volume). (16,000 cells / µL total)
  2. Prepare 4.8M cells in 300uL Growth Media (with 50ug/mL L-ascorbic acid) (Not sure if this is possible, prepare 5M cell pellet and measure volume) (16,000 cells / µL total)
  3. Seed 50uL/sample into wells C3-C8 (without L-ascorbic acid).
  4. Seed 50uL/sample into wells D3-D8 (with 50ug/mL L-ascorbic acid).
  5. Add 50uL/well of Growth Media (without L-ascorbic acid) to samples in wells E3-E8.
  6. Add 50uL/well of Growth Media (without L-ascorbic acid) to all cell-free samples in wells C9-F9.
  7. Add 50uL/well of Growth Media (with 50ug/mL L-ascorbic acid) to samples in wells F3-F8.
  8. Leave for 30 min post seeding.

  

After 30 mins (post-seeding fibroblasts), top up media up to 230uL by adding
180uL/well of Growth Media to all wells (with/without l-ascorbic acid
respectively).  

  




Friday 23APR21:

Sample 1 piece from each condition (see pieces in black boxes). - 4 samples
total.  

D1 Prolif samples- Fix, DAPI stain and Image 1 sample from each condition,
Note down whether there is a good cell coverage across the material/scaffold
surface.

  

1\. Fix with 4% PFA for 15 min.

2\. DAPI stain for 5 min.

3\. Wash 3 x with dPBS.

4\. Image on DAPI channel.

5\. Assess whether fibroblasts adhered. If so, continue with experiment. If
very few or no fibroblasts attached, abort experiment and retry.

  




Friday 23APR21:

D1 Prolif Move seeded scaffolds to a new plate (24-well plate with inserts)
and 100% feed biomaterials/scaffolds with prolif media (same media seeded in)

ORIGINAL PLATE: (Note scaffolds in wells with Black outlines would have been
used for Fix & DAPI)

  

  

  1. Set up 1 x 24-well plate with 3D-printed inserts:  
1 x 24-well plate with:  
\- 2mL/well Growth media (no L-ascorbic acid) in wells A1-A6 & C1-C6  
\- 2mL/well Growth media (50ug/mL L-ascorbic acid) in wells B1-B6 & D1-D6

  

  1. Place plate in the incubator at 37ºC, 5% CO2 for at least 30 mins.
  2. After media is warmed, transfer remaining scaffolds across from 96-well plate to 24-well plate with autoclavable inserts as per plate map above.  
Use sterile forceps for transfer, and change forceps between different
conditions to ensure cells are not moved between different samples.

  3. Return to incubate at 37ºC, 5% CO2.

  

Growth Media = DMEM/F12 + 20% FBS + 1X P/S (with and without) 50ug/mL
L-ascorbic acid




Friday 23APR21:

  

D1 calculate seeding efficiency (tryplisation and count from base of wells,
subtracted from initial seed density)

  

  1. Once 1 sample has been taken from each condition for Fix & DAPI staining, and the remaining samples have been moved to 24-well plate, proceed.

Note* Perform this on wells C3-C8 & D3-D8.

  

1\. Aspirate growth media.

2\. Wash each well with 100uL/well dPBS

3\. Aspirate dPBS.

4\. Add 50uL/well of 1X Tryple to wells C3-C8 & D3-D8.

5\. Incubate at 37ºC, 5% CO2 for 10-15 min or until all samples have detached.

6\. Combine all cell suspensions from each set of 6 x samples (2 mixtures
total).

(i.e. combine cells from wells in Row C into 1 sample. Combine all cell
suspension from wells in Row D into 1 sample.)

7\. Add 200uL of dPBS to THE FIRST well of each condition (C3 & D3) and use it
to wash all 6 wells horizontally and combine all cell suspensions from each
set of 6 x samples into the existing 2 mixtures total. (C3-C8 into sample
without LAA2P & D3-D8 into sample with LAA2P)

8\. You will have 2 x 500uL suspensions (1 from fibroblast cells with Vitamin
C and 1 from cells without Vitamin C)

9\. Collect 10uL samples from each condition and dilute 1:1 with trypan blue.

10\. Perform a cell count on the hemocytoemter for each cell sample and
discard remaining cells.

11\. Calculate the seeding efficiency from total cells seeded to cells
remaining on base of plate.

  

Based on Seeding 560K cells per scaffold.

  




Monday 26APR21:

1\. Mitomycin stunt Fibroblast growth

  

Mitomycin-c treatment

For all of the samples on Zein scaffolds add 0.5mg/ml of mitomycin-c for 4
hours (Diekmann et al., 2015).

Samples required:

Zein

n=5  \+ fibroblasts + MuSC (without L-ascorbic acid)

n=5  \+ fibroblasts + MuSC (with 50ug/mL L-ascorbic acid)

n=5 - MuSC only (without L-ascorbic acid)

n=5 - MuSC only (with 50ug/mL L-ascorbic acid)

n=4 - Empty Zein

= 24 total pieces

  

All samples will undergo a 0.5mg/ml of mitomycin-c, 4 hour treatment.

Prepare 0.5mg/ml of mitomycin-c solution by adding the mitomycin-c into pre-
warmed growth media (`DMEM/F12+20%FBS+1xPS [with and without 50ug/mL
L-ascorbic acid respectively]`), sterile filter the mix and then pipette 1mL
per well of the mix over the relevant samples (to completely cover samples).

0.5mg/ml mitomycin-c with l-ascorbic acid

  * aliquot 12 ml of `DMEM/F12+20%FBS+1xPS+50ug/mL L-ascorbic acid` into a 15 falcon tube and place in the water bath at 37'C `time`
  * weigh out 6mg of mitomycin-c
  * in a BSC add the 6mg of mitomycin-c to the 12ml of pre-warmed media and invert or pipette until homogeneous
  * using a syringe and filter sterile filter the solution into a new labelled 15ml falcon tube
  * pipette 1mL per well of the mix over the relevant samples (n = 5 fibroblasts + MuSCs, n=5 MuSCs only)
  * start timer for 4 hours
  * after 3 hrs 50min aliquot out 36mls of `DMEM/F12+20%FBS+1xPS+50ug/mL L-ascorbic acid` into a 15ml falcon tube and place in the water bath at 37'C `time` (for mitomycin wash steps)

  

0.5mg/ml mitomycin-c without l-ascorbic acid

  * aliquot 16 ml of `DMEM/F12+20%FBS+1xPS` into a 15 falcon tube and place in the water bath at 37'C `time`
  * weigh out 7.5mg of mitomycin-c
  * in a BSC add the 6mg of mitomycin-c to the 12ml of pre-warmed media and invert or pipette until homogeneous
  * using a syringe and filter sterile filter the solution into a new labelled 15ml falcon tube
  * pipette 1mL per well of the mix over the relevant samples (n = 5 fibroblasts + MuSCs, n=5 MuSCs only, n=3 empty Zein)
  * start timer for 4 hours
  * after 3 hrs 50min aliquot out 45mls of `DMEM/F12+20%FBS+1xPS` into a 15ml falcon tube and place in the water bath at 37'C `time` (for mitomycin wash steps)

  

After the 4 hour timepoint wash away the mitomycin-c with at least 3x 5 minute
sterile PBS washes (2mL/well/wash) followed by a growth media wash
(`DMEM/F12+20%FBS+1xPS with and without 50ug/mL L-ascorbic acid`)
1mL/well/wash, then leave in fresh growth media (2mL/well) for at least 1 hour
before taking off the media and seeding with MuSCs.

Harvest and seeding of MuSCs

  1. Harvest cells as per passaging SOP.
  2. Resuspend pellet in `8`mL `DMEM/F12+20%FBS+1xPS` media.
  3. Perform a cell count using a hemocytometer (1:1 dilution in Trypan blue):

Scaffold seeding (with cells) = 16M cells needed

Aim to seed at around 800K - 1M cells per piece

  1. Divide the cell count by number of samples (20) to work out how many cells we can achieve per piece.
  2. Re-suspend the cells in 70µL x 10 of DMEM/F12 + 20% FBS + 1x PS ( no vit C)
  3. Re-suspend the cells in 70µL x 10 of DMEM/F12 + 20% FBS + 1x PS ( + 50ug/mL L-ascorbic-acid )
  4. Aspirate Growth Media off scaffolds.
  5. Seed all cell-laden samples with 70ul of cell suspension per piece:
  6. Add 70uL of DMEM/F12 + 20% FBS + 1x PS ( no vit C) to each of the cell-free samples. (ZEIN ONLY - NO CELLS)

After 30minutes (to allow the cells to adhere) add 2mL of pre-warmed DMEM/F12
+ 20% FBS + 1x PS (with and without 50ug/mL L-ascorbic acid respectively) into
each well.

Place the plate in the incubator (37'C, 5% CO2)
