Process

1\. Each of the cultures listed in the table bellow has 1 well filled. Image
each culture on 10x magnification.




Observations  
Culture 8001 is still not confluent. While there are live, proliferating cells
in the culture, they have not progressed passed the single well of a 6-well
plate since isolation. As our other cultures have been performing far better,
this culture was terminated today.
