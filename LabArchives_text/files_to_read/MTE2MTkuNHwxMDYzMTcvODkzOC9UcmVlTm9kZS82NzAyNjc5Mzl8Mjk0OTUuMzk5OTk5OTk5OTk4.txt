Discussion:
  
  
The analysis of this experiment was done through a DAPI count by ImageJ
macros. This analysis tool while is fairly accurate for some images - can fail
when cell morphology deviates from normal fibroblast morphology. The
morphology of these fibroblasts in albumin containing media resembles cells
that form colonies and clump together. This does not fare particularly well
with the existing ImageJ macros we have on MIA analysis. With some tweaking by
Alex, the %Area identified serves as a good metric.

As seen from the Figures above, no difference in adherence between
concentrations of Albumin has been identified by the ImageJ macro.
Observationally, variable adherence was seen across all conditions when images
were captured and no concrete difference could be seen within Albumin
concentrations. A stark difference was seen between Albumin and Serum
conditions however.

This experiment will need to be repeated in a more controlled fashion to
obtain a more definitive answer regarding concentrations.
