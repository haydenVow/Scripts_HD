### Process:

1\. Aliquotted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then
placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath for a minimum of 20 minutes
prior to use:

  1. Growth media (for seeding):     120    mL 

Time that all aliquots were placed in the water bath the warm before use
15:36

Note: if aliquots were placed in water bath at different time, record the time
stamp for each individual solution.




2\. Removed vessel(s) from the incubator    15:50

3\. Transfer the entire contents into sterile 50 mL flacon tubes

4\. Centrifuged at 300 x g for 5 min.

  1. Start/Finish time for centrifugation was    15:56 - 16:01 




5\. Aspirated the supernatant(s).

6\. Resuspended pellet(s) in     60    mL     Growth     media each    16:11

7\. Transfer cell resuspensions into 2x E250 flasks and return to incubator.




7\. Transferred vessel(s) to incubate at:

  * [x]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (avian cells)
