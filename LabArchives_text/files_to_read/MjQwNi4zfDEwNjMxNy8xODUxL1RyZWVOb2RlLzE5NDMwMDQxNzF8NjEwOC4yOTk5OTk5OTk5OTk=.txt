  1. Prepared scaffolds by cutting with a biopsy punch and scalpel. Scaffolds were very moist and easy to break/deform. 
  2. Placed scaffold onto a sterile acetone washed glass petri dish
  3. Treat with UV sterilization. One side for one hour, and the next side for 30 minutes. 
  4. After UV treatment, the scaffold appeared dry and harder (loss of moisture), therefore decided to reduce UV treatment after flipping samples. 
  5. Autoclaved samples with the pressure cooker at 120 degrees for 100 minutes.
  6. Removed from autoclave. Scaffolds had a different color. More darker then before autoclaving.
