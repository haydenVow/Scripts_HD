Process
  
  
  1. Took 1 x 510 uL aliquot from E250 and performed count on ViCell
  2. Recorded counts in media results spreadsheet: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1cnmEz5amKSGmA9u3BJ-Dn0w-I7zFobBr6pG-UWCYaXM/edit#gid=595130609
  3. Transferred 36.8mL cell suspension containing about 35M cells into 1 x 50mL falcon tube for Second Product Cell Supply.
  4. Kept the remaining 8.2mL of cell suspension containing 7.85M cells in the E250 and added 41.8mL of fresh medium so that cell density was 157K cells/mL. 
  5. Returned flasks to incubator.
