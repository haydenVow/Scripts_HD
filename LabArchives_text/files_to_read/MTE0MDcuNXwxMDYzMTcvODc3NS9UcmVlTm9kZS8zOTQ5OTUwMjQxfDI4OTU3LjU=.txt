Clones were removed from incubator 82 and inspected under the microscope.
Clones that appeared <70% confluent were selected for passage where 50% of the
cells would be transferred to a new well on a 6 well plate containing fresh
growth media.

Clones selected:

ZIC1+DHSR3: B1 (culture: 12481 ), B4 (culture 12019 )

ZIC1: C3 (Culture 12486 ), D1 (culture 11829 )

Zic1+CDKN1A: G2 (culture 12225 ), G6 (culture 11827 )

CDKN1A+CDKN1B: F5 (culture 12222 )

PABPC1: 5D (culture 12168 )

Cells were passaged as follows. Briefly,

  1. Wells were washed with 1mL of dPBS
  2. dPBS was discarded and cells were incubated with 600uL of Tryple-EDTA at 30 degrees for 10 minutes shaking at 80rpm.
  3. After cells had been detached, 300uL of cell suspension was aspirated and transferred to a fresh well on a 6 well plate containing 3mL of growth media (DMEM/F12+20% FBS + 1xP/S)

Cell cultures seeded from these clones were cultures 12757-12764 (see Ranger
for respective clones)

Remaining clones were given a 100% media feed with fresh growth media before
being returned to the incubator
