### Process:

1\. Took image of vessel with microscope on phase setting.

2\. Collect a pre-Gelatin coated    1x 26 WP (first 18 wells) vessels that
were placed in the incubator for 45 minutes.

  1. Time when flask was placed into the incubator     15:38   

3\. Aliquotted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then
placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath for a minimum of 20 minutes
prior to use:

  1. TrypLE:   72  mL in   1x 120mL yellow urine pot  tubes - placed in incubator at 12:56  

  2.  dPBS (for neutralising):   70 mL
  3.  dPBS (for washing):   70   mL
  4. Growth media (for seeding):   1000 mL 

Time that all aliquots were placed in the water bath the warm before use
12:48

Make 20mL of Freeze Media (FBS+10% DMSO) and sterile filter, then place in
fridge prior to use  16:52

Note: if aliquots were placed in water bath at different time, record the time
stamp for each individual solution.




4\. Removed vessel(s) from the incubator  13:15 (MuSC_KUZCO20, and 13:20
(F_KUZCO20)  

5\. Washed the vessel(s) with dPBS (warmed).

6\. Added   10 mL tryple to each vessel/well and incubated at 37˚C.

  1. Start/Finish for TrypLE was   13:40  

7\. Neutralised with   10  dPBS and combined cell suspension into a    1 X
50mL   tube.

8\. Centrifuged at 650 x g for 5 min.

  1. Start/Finish time for centrifugation was  14:15 - 14:20     




9\. Aspirated the supernatant(s).

10\. Resuspended pellet(s) in  50 mL   Growth  media  

11\. Transferred cell suspension into 1 x un-coated T175 flask. Leave at 37C
in incubator for 45 mins  15:48  

12\. Harvest supernatant and collect into 1 x 50mL tube. 16:45

13\. Re-feed T175 flask with Growth Media (30mL) and return to incubator.
117:05

14\. Aspirate gelatin from 24-well plate. 17:05

15\. Combine 4.5mL of cell suspension (from supernatant) with 4.5mL fresh
Growth Media (with 10uM P38i) (total 9mL) 17:07

15.a. Seed 0.5mL of cell suspension into 18 x wells of the 24-well plate
(A1-C6). Allow to settle for 30 mins at RT. 17:45 - 18:15

16\. Centrifuge remaining 45.5mL of cell suspensoin at 650 x g for 5 min at
RT. 17:49 - 17:54

17\. After cells have pelleted, aspirate supernatant. 18:08

18\. Resuspend cells in 16mL Freeze Media 1

19\. Aliquot 500uL/vial into 32 x cryovials.

20\. Immediately place in Mr Frostys and transfer to -80 Freezer. 18:18

20\. Placed in the LN2 the next day  




13\. Transferred vessel(s) to incubate at:

  * [ X ]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (avian cells)




Observations/Summary:

KUZCO20 MuSCs successfully pre-plated in 2 x non-coated T175 flask and then
transferred into 4 x gelatin-coated T175 flask.
