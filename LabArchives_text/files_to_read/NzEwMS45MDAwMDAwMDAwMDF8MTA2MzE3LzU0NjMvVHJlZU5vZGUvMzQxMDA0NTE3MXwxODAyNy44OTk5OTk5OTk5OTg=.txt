Single cell cloning (SCC) is the process by which a single cell is isolated
from a multiclonal or heterogonous population of cells to generate a clonal
population that is genetically identical [1]. Traditional SCC protocols used
at Vow are characterised by FACS sorting individual cells into separate wells
of a 384-well plate, such that any population derived from those cells are
classified as "clonal". Wherein, each daughter cell originates from a single
parent cell and are thus genetically identical. However this attempt at SCC
intends to utilise the best performing DOLLY12 fibroblast cells that have been
in suspension culture > 40 days and sort individual cells into ULA 384 well
plates. ULA plates and coatings are designed to prevent cell adhesion onto
culture-ware surfaces. The rationale is that by utilising fibroblast cells
that have been growing
