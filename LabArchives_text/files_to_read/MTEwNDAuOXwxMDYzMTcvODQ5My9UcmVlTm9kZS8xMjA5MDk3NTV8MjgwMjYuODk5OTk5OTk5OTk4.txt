Process:

  1. Removed the pre existing 200uL of dPBS in each well for each plate.
  2. Added 100uL of PBST - 0.2% Triton-X to each well to permeabilise the cells (9:40am - 10:05am)
  3. Removed PBST and washed plates twice with 200uL of dPBS.
  4. Made up 1000X solution of Phalloidin iFlour488 by adding 30uL of DMSO (S4916) to the frozen pellet stock.
  5. Added 24uL of 1000X Phalloidin stock to 24mL of PBS and stored in dark at 4C.
  6. Added 24uL of DAPI 1000X stock to 24mL of PBS and stored in dark at 4C.
  7. Removed 200uL of PBS from each plate and added 50uL of 1X DAPI solution to each well and incubated (10:53am - 11:03am)
  8. Removed 50uL of DAPI from each well and added 50uL of 1X Phalloidin solution to each well and incubated for 1 hour. (11:10am - 12:30pm)
