PCR TESTING

On 9/2/2022 Wild type CHOMP07 DNA was extracted from 400,000 cells using the
HOTSHOT method and PCR was performed on this sample to amplify the region
between primer sets P5-P6, P7-P8, P9-P10 using the amplification protocol
below with a primer annealing temperature selected of 65 degrees C. This
amplification yeilded no obvious amplified region when compared with the DNA
ladder, only primer dimers were present (see reference images)

On 10/2/2022 - Wild type CHOMP07 DNA that had been previously extracted using
the HOTSHOT method was taken to to UNSW for nanodrop quantification. The DNA
concentration in the sample was found to be 169ng/uL. During our PCR
amplification we estimated at around 825ng of DNA was added to the PCR
reaction mixture, as a result we believe that we added too much DNA which
interfered with primer to template strand binding. We also suspect that
lowering the annealing temperature of primers to 61 degrees may improve our
chances of primer to template strand binding. Therefore the PCR of wild type
CHOMP will be repeated before proceeding with knockout samples.




PCR amplification

  * Reconstituted PTEN, PABPC1 and IGFBP4 primers to 10uM in (MilliQ) prior to beginning the process below.

* * *

  1. Remove DNA extractions from the -20 freezer   
  2. Made up a master mix for 1x reaction for each primer set (PABPC1, PTEN, IGFBP4). Volumes listed below are intended for 1 reaction, *multiply by the number of reactions you wish to do for each gene of interest + 1 for wild type controls). 
    * PTEN mastermix (
    * PABPC1 mastermix 
  3.   4.  Obtain 0.2 mL PCR tubes
  5. Add 25μl of respective MM to each tube 
  6.  Add 5μl DNA from the extracted DNA samples to each tube
  7. Take to the PCR machine and set the settings to:
  8.   9.   

  10. To visualize PCR products, make up a 1.5 % agarose gel in 0.5X TBE buffer. 
    1. See this tutorial for setting up the gel electrophoresis station on the BentoLab https://bento.bio/protocol/biotechnology-101/introduction-to-gel-electrophoresis/
  11.  Prepare DNA extractions suspected as good for sequencing through a third party. 

  




## Observations:

\- 11/2/22 - after running the PCR most of the sample in each tube had
evaporated, as a result the gel was not run and the tubes were kept at 4
degrees.
