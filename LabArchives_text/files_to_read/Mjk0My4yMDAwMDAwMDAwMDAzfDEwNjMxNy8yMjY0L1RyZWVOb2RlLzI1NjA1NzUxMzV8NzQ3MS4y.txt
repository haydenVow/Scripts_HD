Process:

1\. Aliquotted   1mL  mL of  both E6 and HS diff media into  separate
15mL/1.5mL   tube(s). Placed them in the water bath   11:17 am  

Note: E6 aliquot can be found in fridge 74 in the library lab in a 15mL tube.

2\. Inspected the E6 treated wells on the remaining plates for any evidence of
cell death, recorded observations.

Cells in E6 definitely dying, many cells detached and well is <50% confluent
compared to HS which is 100% confluent.

  

2.5. Removed  100 % of supernatant wells B2-B4 and C2-C4 on each 96 well
plate.   11:53 am  

3\. Added E6 diff media (200uL) to Wells B2-B4 on each plate and Horse serum
diff media to wells C2-C4 on each plate. Left wells D2-D4 untouched.

4\. Returned vessel to incubate at:   11:56 am  

  * [x]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (aviary cells)

  

  * Incubator (#78, Library Lab).




### Observations/Summary:

E6 cells lower confluence and some detached cells / strange morphology
compared to HS treated.
