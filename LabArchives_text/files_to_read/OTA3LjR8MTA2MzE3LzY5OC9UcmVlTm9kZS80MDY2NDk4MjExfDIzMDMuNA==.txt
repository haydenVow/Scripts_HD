1\. Gelatin coated  6  x  T175  flasks/plates with sterile filtered 0.1%
gelatin solution and then incubated all coated flasks at 37ºC

  * Time when all flasks placed into the incubator at 10:00    

2\. Aliquoted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then
placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath for a minimum of 20 minutes
prior to use:

  *  Growth media (for seeding):    2x90mL in  2x120mL  containers
  * Time that aliquots were placed in the water bath to warm before use:  14:30

  




## Thaw and seed vial:

3\. Collected the cryovial from Liquid Nitrogen storage & place in foam
floater in water bath for 5 min  : - : a/pm

Location where cryovial was collected from:

of    500K  cells per cell type.

`4. Ethanol sprayed & transferred the vial(s) to the BSC.`

`5.  Added  500µL of Growth Media (to generate a total volume of 1mL in the
cryovial) to each cryovial, resuspended the cell suspension gently to reduce
osmotic shock. `

`6. Collected the entire 1mL of cell suspension from each cryovial &
transferred to separte  pre-warmed 120mL Growth Media aliquots. One aliquot
per cell line.  `

`7. Using a 10mL serological pipette, resuspended & distributed the cells
evenly in each  90mL of pre-warmed Growth Media. `

`8. For each cell type, transfered  30 mL of cell suspension into each of 3
pre-coated  T175  flask after removing excess gelatin.`

`9. Allowed all flasks to rest in the BSC at RT for 30 min  15:15-15:45  
`

`9. Transferred flasks to incubate at: `

  * [x]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (aviary cells)

  

Making labels

Note - You will need to increase the passage number by one. (i.e. if your
thawed vial ID has a passage number of 3, when you make a culture ID for you
vessel you will need change the passage number to 4 on Airtable.)
