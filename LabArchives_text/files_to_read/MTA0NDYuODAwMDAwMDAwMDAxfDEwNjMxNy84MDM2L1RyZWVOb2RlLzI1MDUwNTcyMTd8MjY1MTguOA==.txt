There appear to be an increasing number of "normal"/healthy looking cells vs.
unhealthy looking cells - smaller, more intact/less rough looking membrane,
and less granular/senescent-looking

Process


  1. Removed flasks from incubator 
  2. Took 2 x 50 uL samples from each E-flask
  3. Performed cell counts and averaged for each flask and each condition (recorded in table below)
  4. Aliquoted following volumes of media with growth factors and warmed in water bath
    1. 100/0: 20 mL + 0.0005 mg/mL IGF + 0.0001 mg/mL EGF
    2. 100/0: 20 mL + 0.0005 mg/mL IGF + 0.0005 mg/mL FGF-B \+ 0.0001 mg/mL EGF
  5. Transferred cultures to 2 x 50 mL tubes
  6. Centrifuged at 500 x g for 5 min
  7. Aspirated 100% of supernatant and resuspended cells in respective media
  8. Strained cultures through 40 um cell strainer into 2 x new E-flask ~~  
~~

  9. Returned cultures to incubate at 37 'C, 5% CO2, 120 RPM
