Process:

 1\. Aliquotted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and
then placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath for a minimum of 20 minutes
prior to use:

  1.  TrypLE:  20 mL in 1 x 120 ml urine pot 
  2.  dPBS (for washing)  20 ml  in 1 x 120 ml urine pot
  3.  dPBS (for neutralising)  20 ml  in 1 x 120 ml urine pot

Note: if aliquots were placed in water bath at different times, record the
time stamp for each individual solution.




2\. Washed the flask(s) with dPBS.

3\. Added 10mL tryple to each vessel/well and incubated at 30ºC for 8 min

4\. Neutralised with 10mL dPBS (warmed) and introduced cell suspension into 3
x 50 ml tube & 1 x 15 ml tube T75).

5\. Centrifuged at 400 x g for 5 min  




14\. Aspirated supernatant carefully, taking care not to disturb the pellet.

15\. Performed a cell count:

PABPC1 + CDKN1A cell count:

Control count:

16\. Aliquotted (200k cells/condition) into an eppendorf, and spun down at
500g for 5 minutes:

PABPC1 + CDKN1A ml:

Control ml:

17\. Aspirated the supernatant and froze down in the -80C to use as RNA
extraction samples.

18\. Spun down the remaining cell suspension at 400g for 5 minutes.

19\. Aspirated the supernatant carefully, taking care not to disturb the
pellet.

15\. Resuspended the pellet in 1 mL freeze media (chilled, to reduce DMSO
toxicity).

16\. Aliquotted 1 mL into each cryovial (already labelled).

17\. Tightened the lids & transfer the cryovials to a Mr. Frosty immediately
into the -80ºC freezer.   17:11 pm

18\. Allow the cells to freeze for at least 18-24 hours before transferring to
Liquid Nitrogen storage.
