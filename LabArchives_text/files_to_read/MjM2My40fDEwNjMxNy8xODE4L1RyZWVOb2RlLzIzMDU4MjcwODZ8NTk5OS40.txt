## Performed by: Bonnie Tangey  




Weekend Feed info:

Media aliquot location: Media + gelatin fridge in main lab (under Biostat) in
blue tube rack. There are aliquots for each day, please take the aliquots
marked with the day you are feeding.

Plate location: 2 x 96 well plates in Thermo incubator

Feeding: There are two plates, one is testing gelatin as an ingredient and so
there are media aliquots each with different concentrations of gelatin to feed
this plate (see plate map below). The other is testing gelatin as a coating,
and hence this plate only needs to be fed with normal E6.

For plate testing gelatin as a coating:

  * [X]  E6 (all wells)

For plate testing gelatin as an ingredient:

  * [X]  E6 + 0 mg/mL Gelatin 
  * [X]  E6 + 1 mg/mL Gelatin
  * [X]  E6 + 5 mg/mL Gelatin
  * [X]  E6 + 10 mg/mL Gelatin
  * [X]  E6 + 20 mg/mL Gelatin

IMPORTANT: All aliquots will need to be put in the INCUBATOR not the water
bath as this is the best way to get the higher conc. gelatin aliquots back
into liquid form evenly.

Total media required: 150uL per well,

Only 2.4mL is required for E6 + Gelatin conditions (16 wells per condition)
however a large excess has been aliquotted (5.5mL) as a comfortable excess and
in case of spillage, mistakes etc.

Process:

1\. Placed pre-aliquotted    1 x 15mL (E6) 5 x 5.5mL (E6 + Gelatin)  mL of  E6
Media and E6 + Gelatin (X mg/mL) Media into incubator  10:30

2\. Imaged the top most wells of each plate (Row A) (excluding PBS wells on
the edges) under 5X or 4X magnification and linked MIA capture link below.

2\. Aspirated   150uL of growth media from each well.

3\. Replaced with  150uL  (per well/per vessel) of  Differentiation  media.

4\. Returned vessel to incubate at:   11:40 , incubator #  Thermo  

  * [X]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (aviary cells)
