# Procedure - Feed

# Note: Fibroblasts do NOT require Gelatin coated Flasks, and do NOT require
p38i.  

  1. Turn on the water bath and set to 37'C.
  2. Aliquot  required growth media into a sterile container/s and place into the water bath. 
  3. Place in the water bath and heat for at least 20 minutes.
  4. Observe the cell flasks for confluence under the microscope using 4 x magnification and take images as required. Note: The confluence of cells must be <50% to perform cell feeding in P1-P3 and <80% in P4 prior to the cell differentiation stage. 
  5. Transfer flasks to the BSC and remove required volume of media from each flask (according to the Table below).
  6. Replace the same volume into each flask with the prepared growth media.
  7. Return the flasks to the incubators

Sets 1,3 & 4: 50% Feed (Normal)


All T175's were imaged and observed for confluence. Annoyingly all of them are
seeded unevenly in that they all have higher confluence in the bottom half of
the flasks and less in the top half - the difference is alot more obvious now
with the bottom half being alot more confluent than the top (I think some have
a difference as high as 25% difference).

The Vit C seeded flasks are definitely growing faster. I would estimate an
overall confluence of 90-95%.  
The ones I treated with Vit C at pre-confluence (Set 2, yesterday) look more
confluent than the non-treated flasks. I estimate about an overall 75-90%
confluence.  
All untreated flasks I estimate an overall confluence of 60-70%.

It was decided that 'At confluence' treatment would not occur today as
originally planned. Instead all flasks (set 1,3 & 4) not fed or treated
yesterday will receive a 50% feed today (24/08/21).
