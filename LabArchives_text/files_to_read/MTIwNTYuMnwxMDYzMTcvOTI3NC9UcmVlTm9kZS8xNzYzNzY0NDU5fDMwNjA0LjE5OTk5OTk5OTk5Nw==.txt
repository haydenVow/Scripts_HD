Process:

  1. Placed the 2L of control media and 2L of MMC media in water bath at 9:10am. A 400mL aliquot of Ficoll PM 70 media was added in at 9:30am.
  2. Inspected 5CS under main lab Primo microscope. Inspected T175 cultures (13210, 13209) under the Primo microscope as well. See "Observations" below.
  3. To one 5CS, removed the pre exisiting 500mL of seed media and replaced it with 2L MMC media.
  4. To the other 5CS, removed the pre existing 500mL of seed media and replaced it with 2L Control media.
  5. To one T175, removed the pre exisiting 30mL of seed media and replaced it with 100mL MMC media.
  6. To the other T175, removed the pre existing 30mL of seed media and replaced it with 100mL Control media.
  7. At this point, James mentioned he had spare confluent 2 x T175s that I could use for my extra F70 and control media. The same feed process was performed on these flasks too.




Observations/Summary:

  

Inspection of 5CS cultures:

Only about 70% attachment was observed here and the over cell density
regardless of attachment is also low. This density is a little higher than the
4CF cultures earlier in the week hence these cultures will be taken forward in
the MMC treatment. Macroscopically it looks like it may be possible to have an
ECM sheet generated at this density (see image of 5CS above) - we will just
have to see.

Inspection of T175 flasks (13209 and 13210):

The cell density here is lower than the 5CS even, however it may be possible
to still generate sheets here.
