Aim/Purpose


  * To determine if addition of flocculants to cell suspension will reduce the number of cells in supernatant 


Hypothesis


It is expected that addition of flocculants will reduce the number of cells in
supernatant compared to control conditions where no flocculant has been added


Technical Gap


Efficient biomass recovery or harvesting of cells cultured in suspension
represents a critical bottleneck for large-scale bioprocess and manufacturing.
Vow's current method of cell harvest and previous experience has only been of
using bench-top centrifuges in combination with 250-500mL bottles to pellet
cells by centrifugation. This approach becomes more time consuming and less
practical as cell suspension broth volumes increased with increased bioreactor
capacity. Flocculation by chemical addition is a simple, easy method to
increase the efficiency of harvesting by inducing the aggregation of cells by
neutralising membrane charges. For review, please see Matter et al 2019.


Method/Procedure


See link to original workflow written by Tom Tarento

Conditions:

  * Control 1 (no additions)
  * Control 2 (vehicle addition only: 1% acetic acid solution)
  * Control 3: (alginate addition only)
  * Chitosan 10mg/L
  * Chitosan 40mg/L
  * Chitosan 120mg/L
  * Chitosan 10mg/L + 40mg/L alginate
  * Chitosan 40mg/L + 40mg/L alginate
  * Chitosan 120mg/L + 40mg/L alginate 
  * Prepare buffers:
    * prepare 100mL of 1% v/v acetic acid solution: 1mL acetic acid in 100mL dH2O
    * prepare buffers:
      * weigh out x2 lots of 240mg of chitosan
      * weigh out x2 lots of 80mg sodium alginate
      * prepare x4 tubes of 20mL of 1% acetic acid solution in 50mL falcon tubes and label "A" (nil), "B"(chitosan), "C" (chitosan+alginate) and "D" (alginate)
      * no additions to tube A
      * to tube B, add 240mg chitosan and mix by inversion
      * to tube C, add 80mg alginate and mix by inversion. If necessary, microwave in 20 sec lots (kitchen microwave). Allow to cool and add 240mg chitosan. Mix by inversion
      * to tube D, add 80mg alginate and mix by inversion. If necessary, microwave in 20 sec lots (kitchen microwave). 
    * prepare serial dilution series:
      * prepare x6 15mL falcon tubes. Label each 1.1, 1.2, 1.3 and 2.1, 2.2, and 2.3
      * add the following volumes to the following tubes:
        * 1.1 4mL from B
        * 1.2 3mL from A
        * 1.3 3mL from A
        * 2.1 4mL from C
        * 2.2 3mL from D
        * 2.3 3mL from D
      * perform 1:4 serial dilution for both series, taking 1mL from x.1 and adding/mixing consecutively to each dilution

  * Method:
    * prepare 200mL cell broth at a density of 1 million cells/mL
    * aliquot 20mL per tube into 50mL falcon tubes
    * use tablet to image tubes before flocculate addition
    * take 200uL of each condition and add to 96-well plate to image before flocculation
    * add flocculant at 1% of cell broth volume (i.e. add 200uL of buffer to each prescribed tube)
    * use tablet to image tubes at 0, 5, and 30 minutes after addition
    * at the above timepoints, sample 200ul from supernatant and add to 96-well plate for imaging
    * image under microscope
