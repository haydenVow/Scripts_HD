Prepare materials for thaw and seed:

1\. Gelatin coated   3 x  T175  flasks with sterile filtered 0.1% gelatin
solution and then incubated all coated flasks at 37ºC  (Note: 1 vial is seeded
into 3 x T175)

  * Time when all flasks placed into the incubator  12:05 pm 

2\. Aliquotted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then
placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath for a minimum of 20 minutes
prior to use:

  *  Growth media (for seeding):    90 mL growth media +      45 uL p38i 
  * Time that aliquot was placed in the water bath to warm before use:  13:00  

  




## Thaw and seed vial:

  1. Collected the cryovial from Liquid Nitrogen storage & place in foam floater in water bath for 5 min  13:40 - 13:45  
  2. Location where cryovial was collected from: T6-B6-A3

Vial details:  1   x  BUFFY6  WCB cryovials at   540K  cells each for a total
of   540K  cells

` `

  1. `Ethanol sprayed & transferred the vial(s) to the BSC.`
  2. `Added 500 µL of Growth media (to generate a total volume of 1 mL in the cyrovial) to the cyrovial, reuspended the cell suspension gently to reduce osmotic shock. `
  3. `Collected the entire 1 mL of cell suspension and transfer into the prewarmed tube of growth media. `
  4. `Using a serological pipette, resuspend and distribute the cells evenly in the  90 mL of pre-warmed Growth media. `
  5. `Transfered   30 mL to each pre-coated   T175 flask/well, allow to rest in the BSC at RT for 30 minutes  14:05 - 14:35  ```
  6. `Transfered flask/plate(s) to incubate at: 14:40`

  * [X]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells) - Incubator:  #118 (Top Sanyo)           

  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (aviary cells)

  

Making labels

Note - You will need to increase the passage number by one. (i.e. if your
thawed vial ID has a passage number of 3, when you make a culture ID for you
vessel you will need change the passage number to 4 on Airtable.)
