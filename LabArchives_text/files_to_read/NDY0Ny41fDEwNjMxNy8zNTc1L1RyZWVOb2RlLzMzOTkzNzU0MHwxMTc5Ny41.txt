Growth Media:

  * [x]  DMEM/F12 + 10% FBS + 1X P/S




### Process:  

3\. Aliquoted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then
placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath for a minimum of 20 minutes
prior to use: 13:57 pm

  1. TrypLE:    10    mL in     1 x 15mL Falcon Tube  tub
  2.  dPBS (for washing and neutralising):    10mL    mL 
  3. dPBS (for neutralising):    10mL    mL
  4. Growth media (for pellet resuspension):   5   mL 
  5. Growth media (for seeding):  240 mL.

Time that all aliquots were placed in the water bath the warm before use

Note: if aliquots were placed in water bath at different time, record the time
stamp for each individual solution.




4\. Removed vessel(s) from the incubator

5\. Washed the vessel(s) with dPBS (warmed).

6\. Added    10   mL tryple to each vessel/well and incubated at 37ËšC.

  1. Start/Finish for TrypLE was   14:21 pm   

7\. Neutralised with    10 mL   dPBS and combined cell suspension.

8\. Centrifuged at 650 x g for 5 min.

  1. Start/Finish time for centrifugation was   14:34 pm   




9\. Aspirated the supernatant(s).

10\. Resuspended pellet(s) in   5  mL   growth   media

11\. Aliquoted     10uL    of resuspended cells into a microcentrifuge tube
for cell count.

12\. Performed a cell count using the haemocytometer and recorded the cell
count data in the Google Doc spreadsheet called 'Cell Count Spreadsheet' (see
link below):

SSIBtIylyrBQE5kRX5Z8NtI/edit#gid=0  

  1. Volume of cell suspension required for subculture was:    used all    

  2. Cell density per vessel:   1,225,000 cells per flask   

13\. Added cell suspension into 180mL of growth media.

14\. Seeded 6 x T175 by adding 30 mL of resuspended cells in media into each
T175

15\. Placed in incubator at 15:50 pm (Library - bottom binder #68)




1\. Supernatant from original flask collected in 1 x 50mL tube was centrifuged
at 300 x g for 5 min at RT.

2\. 25mL aspirated and discarded into waste. Remaining 5mL of supernatant was
used to resuspend anything that pelleted in the centrifuge.

3\. 5mL transferred into 1 x T25 flask, and collected by LL to go to Main Lab.

### Observations/Summary:

6 x T175 flasks successfully seeded at 7,000 cells / cm2 with F_NANDO3 cells




### Results

  * Results were;
    * [ X ]  As Usual (this is a repetitive task)
    * [ ]  Unexpected because...
    * [ ]  Need to be further analysed
    * [ ]  Other (.......)
