Primary Culture of Lobster (Homarus americanus) Olfactory Sensory Neurons:

Ruben Stepanyan, Bettye Hollins, S. Erin Brock and Timothy S. McClintock

  * Temperature: 4 degrees
  * Media: L-15 + ALS + Antibiotics
  * ALS ingredients: (460 mM NaCl, 13 mM KCl, 13 mM CaCl2, 10 mM MgCl2, 1.7 mM D-glucose, 10 mM HEPES, pH 7.4)
  * The olfactory organ, which occupies the end of the lateral branch of the first antenna, was removed and submerged for 5 min in 10% Listerine in an antibiotic lobster saline (ALS).
  * Hemisections were gently agitated on a shaker (22 cycles/min) in ALS containing 1 mg/ml collagenase for 20 min and then in calcium free lobster saline (same as ALS but lacking the CaCl2) containing 1 mg/ml trypsin for 10 min.
  * Hemisections were then washed once with ALS and transferred to fresh ALS.
  * OSN somata clusters of the aesthetasc sensilla were collected from the hemisections by aspiration into a 5 ml syringe through a sterile 26-gauge needle and then injected into 35 mm Falcon culture dishes or 24-well plates containing culture medium. Passage twice through the 26-gauge needle was sufficient to separate many individual cells from the clusters.




Development and utilization of crustacean long-term primary cell cultures:
Ecdysteroid effects in vitro

MICHAEL D. BRODY AND ERNEST S. CHANG

  * Temperature: 20 degrees
  * Media: M199 + 10% FBS + NaCl
  * Collagenase Type II (200U/ml) for 2-3 days  used for enzymatic digestion
  * Healthy-appearing (no lesions or lethargy), intermolt animals were surface sterilized with 20% Wescodyne for 10 min or until the animals were no longer active. Animals were rinsed with 70% ethanol and air dried in a laminar flow hood for 5 min. Aseptic carapace removal was accomplished by splitting the dorsal seam towards the rostrum and pulling each half of the carapace free of the thorax. Hematopoietic and testicular tissues were carefully removed with thrice-flamed serrated mosquito forceps, avoiding contact with the gut and midgut gland and other sources of contamination. Tissues were placed in a drop of medium (see Table 1) in sterile pem dishes and minced 10-20 times with curved iris scissors or until tissue fragments were small cubes (0.1-1.0 mm3); excessive mincing of the tissue resulted in poor viability. To dissociate the tissue, fragments were incubated with 200 U/ml type I1 collagenase (Worthington) for 2-3 days at 20°C or until the tissue formed smears across the bottom of the flask.




Cell Culture from Tissues of Grass Prawn,Penaeus monodon

  * Prior to the experiment, the prawn was surface sterilized by immersion in freshly prepared 10•" sodium hypochloride for 10 minutes and then wiped with 70 % ethyl alcohol 5 times at interval of three minutes. Tissues including heart, gonad, gut, nerve, muscle and hepatopan creas, were removed using sterile forceps and scissors. The excised tissues were then washed in a buffeted solution containing 50% Hank's balanced salt solution,50 % sterile sea water, 1,000 IU/ml penicillin and 1,000 mg/ml streptomycin and cut into approximately 1 mm3 cubes. Sub sequently, the tissue fragments were used either for direct cultivation or for trypsinization ex periments a
