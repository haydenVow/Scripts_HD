### Process:

1\. Took image of vessel with microscope on phase setting.

2\. Moved plated zein to BSC. Aspirated media from scaffold pieces. Left lid
ajar for media to evaporate during passage. 12:05

3\. Aliquotted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then
placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath for a minimum of 20 minutes
prior to use:

  1. TrypLE:   270  mL
  2.  dPBS (for washing and neutralising):   340  mL
  3. Growth media (D/F for pellet resuspension):   7  mL 
  4. Growth media (9C for pellet resuspension):   10  mL 
  5. Growth media (9C for seeding):   3  mL 
  6. Growth media (10C for seeding):   3  mL 
  7. Growth media (11C for seeding):   3  mL 

Time that all aliquots were placed in the water bath the warm before use
11:40 am

Note: if aliquots were placed in water bath at different time, record the time
stamp for each individual solution.




4\. Removed vessel(s) from the incubator

5\. Washed the vessel(s) with dPBS (warmed).

6\. Added   200  mL tryple to 4CF and 10 mL tryple to each T175 and incubated
at 37˚C.

  1. Tryple 4CF timestamp: 12:22 - 12:35
  2. Tryple T175 timestamp: 12:29 - 12:52  (Cells taking unusually long time to detach - checked at 12:45 but not ready yet)

7\. Neutralised 4CF with   200 mL   dPBS and combined cell suspension into  8
x 50 mL tubes. Neutralised T175s with 10 mL dPBS and combined cell suspension
into 4 x 50 mL tubes.

8\. Centrifuged at 650 x g for 5 min.

  1. 4CF: 12:45 - 12:50
  2. T175: 13:02 - 13:07




9\. Aspirated the supernatant(s).

10\. Resuspended 4CF pellet in   10  mL  D/F growth media and resuspended T175
pellet in 7 mL 9C growth media

11\. Aliquoted   2 x 100 uL (4CF) & 1 x 20 uL (T175)  of resuspended cells
into a microcentrifuge tube for cell count.

12\. Performed a cell count using the haemocytometer and recorded the cell
count data in the Google Doc spreadsheet called 'Cell Count Spreadsheet' (see
link below):

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1DPzKubYxfHmWogVPihC-
SSIBtIylyrBQE5kRX5Z8NtI/edit#gid=0

  1. Total cell number (4CF) was: 14,680,000
  2. Total cell number (T175) was: 4,446,000  
These cell count numbers are a lot lower than expected. This may have been due
to uneven seeding of the 4CF (noted in this lab book entry: https://au-
mynotebook.labarchives.com/) and low confluence of T175s seen on Saturday
(noted in this lab book entry: https://au-mynotebook.labarchives.com/). Flasks
were checked after Tryplisation and showed minimal cells remaining attached.
Decided to do 0.7M cells/scaffold rather than 0.8, take out one media
condition (11E) and go down one rep from 4 to 3.




13\. Re-centrifuged tubes to achieve a higher concentration of cells/mL to
allow for scaffold seeding (2.5 mL for 9C pellet, 650 uL for D/F pellet)

14\. Transferred   119  µl/well of ACF cell suspension and   102  µl/well of
D/F cell suspension to the pre-plated zein scaffolds in the 96WP (700K cells
per scaffold piece)

16\. Left at RT in the BSC for 30 min to allow cells to settle   15:00  \-
15:30

17\. Added warmed 9C, 10C, 11C, and D/F media to zein scaffolds according to
plate map up to 230 uL of media per well.

18\. Transferred vessel(s) to incubate at:

  * [X]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (avian cells)

Observations/Summary:

Cells harvested from 1 x 4CF (in 9C medium) and 7 x T175s
(D/F+20%FBS+1xP/S+P38i) and seeded onto zein pieces.




### Results:

  * Results were;
    * [ ]  As Usual (this is a repetitive task)
    * [X]  Unexpected because...
      * Expected far higher cell counts. Had to adjust experimental design on the spot to work with the cell numbers we achieved
    * [ ]  Need to be further analysed
    * [ ]  Other (.......)
