Aim


To expand CAR Goldfish cells to a WCB.


Hypothesis


Continued culture of an initial population of ?M CAR Goldfish fibroblast cells
will allow for a bank of ~100 million cells within 3 passages.


Technical gap


We have not cultured CAR Goldfish fibroblasts before, therefore we do not know
how well they will grow in adherent culture or what their doubling times will
be. Information on CAR Goldfish cell source can be found here and here.


Method


Experimental Plan (Approximate timeline - we do not know how these cells will
grow so this is very prone to change, we will need to continually monitor for
confluence)  
D0: seed full vial into 1xT75 (at least 7500 cells/cm2)  
D1: 50% feed  
D3 (or when confluent): passage into 2xT175 (assuming flask is at least 80%
confluence, seed at 7500 cells/cm2 i.e. 1.3M per T175 flask)  
D5 (or 72hr after passage): 50% feed  
D7 (or when confluent):  passage 2xT175 into 1x 4CF (assuming flask is at
least 80% confluence, seed at 7500 cells/cm2, i.e. 1.9M per 4CF)  
D9 (or 72hr after passage): 50% feed  
D12: Harvest and freeze cells  
D13: Transfer to LN  
  
Note - media should be refreshed twice weekly, in a situation where cells are
taking more than 3 days to reach confluence following a passage the media
should be changed accordingly
