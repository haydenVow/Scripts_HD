Procedure


PASSAGING OF NUCLEOFECTED CELLS

1\. Took 1 x images of both the control 2CF and the ZIC1 2CF.

2\. Aliquoted the required volume of each reagent below, placed all aliquots
to warm in the bead bath for a minimum of 20 minutes prior to use:

  1. TrypLE (100 ml/vessel): 200 ml in 2 x 120 ml pots
  2. dPBS (100 ml for neutralising): 200 ml in 2 x 120 ml pots
  3. dPBS (100 ml for washing): 200 ml in 2 x 120 ml pots
  4. dPBS for resuspension/DNA extraction (10 ml/condition): 20 ml in total
  5. Hycell cho basal media + GFs: 35 ml in total (30 ml + excess)  
  

The following passaging protocol was followed for each knockout/control group.
The supernatant from the flask was also collected at all steps prior to
centrifugation. All conditions were kept in separate tubes.

3\.  Collected culture supernatant and washed each well GENTLY with 100 mL of
dPBS/flask (warmed).  

4\. Collected dPBS wash into the 250 ml centrifugation tubes containing
previously collected supernatant. Added   100  mL tryple to each flask, cells
were then incubated at 37˚C for 8 minutes.  

5\. Collected supernatants into 250mL tubes alongside previous supernatants
and washed flask with  100 ml  of dPBS. dPBS washes were then also collected.  

6\. Centrifuged collections at 400 x g for 5 min.  

7\. Aspirated and discarded the supernatant(s) from cell pellets.

8\. Using dPBS, resuspended and combined the pellets from the same condition
into one tube, taking care to rinse out tubes with a small aliquot of dPBS.  
  
Total volume of cell suspension at this step for each cell pellet was:  

9\. Aliquoted 10uL of cell suspension for counting using a hemocytometer,
mixing ____ with Trypan blue.

10\. Cell suspensions were counted and total cell number was determined for
each group in the document below.

13\. Estimated volume of cell suspension needed to take for DNA extraction and
subsequent PCR (3x10^4 cells) and estimated volume of cell suspension needed
to take for suspension cultures (5x10^6 cells).

14\. Aliquoted the volumes of cell suspension listed for DNA extraction above
into individual 1.5mL tubes. Aliquoted the volumes above for suspension
cultures into 15mL tubes.




SETTING UP SUSPENSION POOLED CULTURES

  1. 15mL tubes containing cell suspensions were centrifuged at 500g for 5 minutes.
  2. Supernatant was removed from each tube and replaced with Hycell Cho basal media + KSR + FGF-b + IGF1-LR3 to a maximum final concentration listed in the table above (Minimum volume in each tube was 5mL). 
  3. Cells from each condition were then resuspended and transferred to 3 x separate 50mL bioreactor tubes per condition.
  4. Tubes were placed in incubator (main lab), at 30 degrees C, 5% CO2, 3 x 50ml tube per condition shaking at 120 rpm.

  




FREEZING PELLETS FOR DNA EXTRACTION

  1. Added an additional 0.2mL of dPBS to each aliquot of cells taken for DNA extraction. 
  2. Centrifuged tubes at 500g for 5 minutes to pellet cells. 
  3. Removed supernatant from each tube then added all tubes to a yellow lid pot labelled with the epic number and date. 
  4. Stored cell pellets at −20°C in the bottom shelf of the freezer in library lab (63)
