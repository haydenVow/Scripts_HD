Process:

1\. Aliquotted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then
placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath for a minimum of 20 minutes
prior to use:

  1.  TrypLE: 200 mL in | 1 | tubes 
  2.  dPBS (for neutralising & washing)  400  mL in | 1 | tubes 
  3.  Growth media (for pellet resuspension):   40 mL in | 1 | tubes 
  4.  Time that all aliquots were placed in the water bath to warm before use:    13:57 pm 

Note: if aliquots were placed in water bath at different times, record the
time stamp for each individual solution.




2\. Washed the flask(s) with dPBS.

3\. Added | 200 |mL tryple to each vessel/well and incubated at 37ºC for |
10-15 | min

  1.  Start/Finish time for TrypLE was:   14:21 - 14:26 pm 
  2.  Note that fibroblasts typically require 15-18 minutes of tryple incubation. 

4\. Neutralised with | 200mL | dPBS (warmed) and combined cell suspension into
a | 8 x 50mL | tubes.

5\. Centrifuged at 650 x g for 5 min

  1.  Start/Finish time for centrifugation was:   14:46 - 14:51 pm 




6\. Aspirated the supernatant(s).

7\. Resuspend pellet(s) in | 40 |mL | Growth | media.

8\. Performed a cell count using the haemocytometer and recorded the cell
count data in the Google Doc spreadsheet called 'Cell Count Spreadsheet' (see
link below):

SSIBtIylyrBQE5kRX5Z8NtI/edit#gid=0

9\. Total cell number was: | 135M cells |

10. Calculate the required volume cell suspension & freeze medium to generate a concentration of ~2E6 (2M) cells/mL. ~1 million fibroblasts per cryovial should be frozen. 




11\. Prepared  70 mL Freeze Medium: (FBS + 10% DMSO). ID # 10476  

Stored at 4ºC until use to keep chilled.

12\. Centrifuged cells at 650 x g for 5 min.  16:46 - 16:51 pm

Whilst centrifuge is spinning, prepared & printed vial labels, labelled
cryovials.




13\. Aspirated supernatant carefully, taking care not to disturb the pellet.

14\. Resuspended the pellet in | 68 |mL freeze media (chilled, to reduce DMSO
toxicity).

15\. Aliquotted | 1000 |µL into | 68 | x cryovials (already labelled). (NOTE*
ENDED UP BEING 67 vials)

16\. Tightened the lids & transfer the cryovials to a Mr. Frosty immediately
into the -80ºC freezer.   17:07  pm

  * [ X ]  With foam (all)
  * [ ]  Without foam
  * [ X ]  1st Freeze (3)
  * [ X ]  2nd Freeze (1)
  * [ ]  3rd Freeze
  * [ ]  4th Freeze
  * [ ]  5th Freeze

17\. Allow the cells to freeze for at least 18-24 hours before transferring to
Liquid Nitrogen storage.




Observations/Summary:

  * 135M Aklpaca fibroblasts frozen in 67 x vials total.
