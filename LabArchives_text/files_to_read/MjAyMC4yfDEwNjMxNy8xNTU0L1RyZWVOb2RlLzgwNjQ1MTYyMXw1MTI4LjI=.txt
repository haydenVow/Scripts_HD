Key Findings:

The cells in ACF media died within 3 weeks and did not stay alive beyond 2
passages. Our fibrolife media and the E8+goodies media were not capable of
sustaining fibroblast growth, even when albumin was added. Our control cells
in DMEM/F12 + 20% FBS grew and thus there were no issues with the cells
themselves, only with the cell culture media.

It appears that a key ingredient or several key ingredients for fibroblast
growth may be missing from our cell culture media. These key ingredients must
be present in serum, and thus allowed our control cells to proliferate, but
are not present in the ACF media formulations as they currently stand.

Limitations & Future Directions:

In the future, we will undoubtedly return to our efforts to focus on growing
primary fibroblasts in ACF media, though in the short term we will focus on
adapting adherent fibrolasts to suspension culture using FBS.  
  
In the long run, fibroblast do grow well when knock-out serum replacement
(KSR) is used in place of FBS. KSR contains the following ingredients:

1\. Amino Acids: Glycine, L-histidine, L-isoleucine, L-methionine,
L-phenylalanine, L-proline, L-hydroxyproline, L-serine, L-threonine,
L-tryptophan, L-tyrosine, L-valine (essential aa)  
2\. Vitamins/Antioxidants: Thiamine, reduced glutathione, ascorbic acid
2-PO43.

3\. Trace Elements: Ag+, Al3+, Ba2+, Cd2+, Co2+, Cr3+, Ge4+, Se4+, Br−, I−,
F−, Mn2+, Si4+, V5+, Mo6+, Ni2+, Rb+, Sn2+, Zr4+  
4\. Proteins: Transferrin (iron-saturated), insulin, lipid-rich albumin
(AlbuMAX)  
  
The fibrolife media contained the following ingredients:

50ug/mL LAA2P (100mg/mL) 1:2000 dilution (0.02mL = 20µL)  
5ng/mL FGF (25ug/mL stock)  1:5000 dilution) (0.008mL = 8µL)  
5ug/mL Insulin  
5ng/mL EGF (0.1mg in 1mL dPBS (14.28uM conc.)  1:2000 dilution) (0.02mL =
20µL)  
30pg/mL TGFb (2ug/mL) 1:66,666 dilution (0.0006mL = 0.6µL)  
500ug/mL albumin (ID 1803) (200000ug/mL 1:4 dilution)  
0.6uM Linolic acid L1376-5G      stock 0.92g/mL (fatty acid)  
L-glutamine (7.5mM)  
1X P/S Antibiotics

  
KSR does however lead to formation of fibroblast sheets and cells do not make
it past the passaging steps, perhaps due to the concentration of vitamin C in
KSR. Thus, 50ug/mL Vit C found in the fibrolife formulation may be a more
effective concetration.  
  
Our current ACF formulations may be missing some lipids found in KSR (e.g.
lipid-rick albumax, compared to linolic acid). Reduced glutathione or thymine
may also be important, and we could try supplementing our media with trace
elements in the future as well. D/F should contain most of the trace elements
