### Process:

1\. Took image of vessel with microscope on phase setting.

3\. Aliquotted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then
placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath for a minimum of 20 minutes
prior to use:

  1. TrypLE:     10    mL in     1    tubes
  2.  dPBS (for neutralising):    10     mL
  3.  dPBS (for washing):     10    mL
  4. Growth media (for pellet resuspension):     3.5    mL
  5. Growth media (for seeding):     15    mL 

Time that all aliquots were placed in the water bath the warm before use    15
: 24  

Note: if aliquots were placed in water bath at different time, record the time
stamp for each individual solution.




4\. Removed vessel(s) from the incubator    15 :38  

5\. Washed the vessel(s) with dPBS (warmed).

6\. Added    3    mL tryple to each vessel/well and incubated at 37˚C.

  1. Start/Finish for TrypLE was    15 : 49 - 16:09     

7\. Neutralised with    3 mL      dPBS and combined cell suspension into a
1     tube for each clone.

8\. Centrifuged at 650 x g for 5 min.

  1. Start/Finish time for centrifugation was    16 : 17 - 16:22  a/pm 




9\. Aspirated the supernatant(s).

10\. Resuspended pellet(s) in     1    mL      growth    media    16 : 40
a/pm

11\. Aliquoted      10 uL    of resuspended cells into a microcentrifuge tube
for cell count.

12\. Performed a cell count using the haemocytometer and recorded the cell
count data in the Google Doc spreadsheet: Cell Count Spreadsheet or cell count
widget below

  1. Total cell number was:   
    1.  flask 7760: 220 000  

    2. flask 7741: 716 000  

    3. flask 7823: 404 000         

  2. Volume of cell suspension required for subculture was: 
    1. 7760: 795 uL  

    2. 7741: 244 uL  

    3. 7823: 433 uL        

  3. Cell density per vessel:    7000 cells/cm^2 (175 000 cells/flask)     
  4. Cells were placed in fridge because I had a meeting (16:55 - 17:20)  




13\. Transferred       (see above)    µl of cell suspension to the pre-warmed
5     mL Growth media:     time not recorded

14\. Transferred cell suspension into T25 flasks.

16\. Transferred vessel(s) to incubate at: 17:49

  * [X]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (avian cells)




Observations/Summary:

Passaged 3 clones from T25 flasks back into T25 flasks
