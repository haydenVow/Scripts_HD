Continuous Culture Results


The Continuous culture was started 3 times because of 2 contaminated cultures.
The third attempt was also terminated early due to very slow growth of the
cells in IH-003. Over the 2 passages the cell number reduced by almost 50%
despite more proliferation days. It was therefore decided that IH-003 was not
satisfactory for use in production. A number of things could have contributed
to this outcome, these include:

  * 50L worth of powder was weighed out and kept in yellow sample jars for 1 month before the media production day
  * Reconstituted reagents were made 1 month before the media production day and kept in the -20 Freezer (these were used in the previous batch of IH-media, IH-002). Instead of making these fresh most were just thawed and used as required. 
  * The pH of IH-003 was adjusted with NaOH. This adjustment may have been too much and resulted in a slightly alkaline solution which effected cell health/growth.

To further investigate the effects of the pH adjustment on the performance of
IH-003, IH-003 will be included in the next proliferation assay where a number
of pH readjustments will be performed.

Detail for the new proliferation assay can be found in the "Corning Media &
IH-003 retest" folder: https://au-
