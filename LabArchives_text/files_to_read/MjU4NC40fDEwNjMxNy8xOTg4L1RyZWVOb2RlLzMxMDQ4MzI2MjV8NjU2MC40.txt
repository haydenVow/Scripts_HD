## Reagent preparation:

  1. Aliquot reagents following the table below: 

Note: Tryple needs to be completely warm before using otherwise cells will not
detach

## Image flask

  1. Observed flask under the microscope at 4x or 5x objective for even cell distribution and < 50% confluency. Refer to VSOP006_0
  2. Took at least 3 images per flask and returned flask back to incubator.

  




## Harvest

  1. Transfer flask and aliquots into BSC, ensuring to wipe down containers with 70% EtOH during the transfer.   
  2. Discarded growth media from each flask (for cell factory, carefully poured growth media ideally into a >500 mL waste bottle).
  3. Washed with warmed dPBS, then discarded. (for cell factory equalised and gently swirled flask

  




  1. Added TrypLE to each of the flasks. Swirled flask thoroughly to ensure coverage of the surface area.
  2. Placed in the incubator at 37C.
  3. After 5 minutes, swirled flask again to ensure all surfaces are covered.
  4. After 10 minute, removed flasks and observed for 95-100% dissociation of cells. Incubated further if needed until maximum dissociation level is reached.
    1. Flask 1 `Time stamp`: 14:43 -14:55 (SS)- Serum
    2. Flask 2 `Time stamp`: 14:46-15:28 (SS)- ACF
    3. Flask 3 `Time stamp`: 14:46-15:30 (BT)- ACF
    4. Flask 3 `Time stamp`: 14:46-15:33 (BT)- ACF

  




  1. Collected TrypLE solution into 50mL centrifuge tubes (labelled *).
  2. Wash flask with ambient temperature dPBS and transferred into 50 mL centrifuge tube.  (for cell factories, preform the wash twice with 100 mL of dPBS each time)
  3. Centrifuged at 650 x g for 5 minutes. `Time stamp` : 15:25, 15:40, 15:46

  




  1. Gently removed centrifuge tubes from the machine, ensuring not to disturb the suspended pellets. Aspirated the supernatant from the tubes, prioritising tubes labeled with *. Discarded supernatant. Removed remaining supernatant with a 1mL pipette.
  2. Resuspend the pellet in 1 mL of growth media at a time. Pooled into one tube. Washed tubes labeled with * with reamaining growth media by transferring media from one tube to the next.
  3. Measure the total volume of the cell resuspension using a serological. 
  4. Using the same serological, pipette mix cell suspension to ensure a homegenous cell suspension is obtained. 
  5. Immediately aliquot 2 x    100uL  of cell resuspension into cell count tubes. Volume of cell suspension is below:

Cell count

  1. For ACF: Cell count performed using Stanleys automated cell counting in Mia. See spreadsheet here: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1DPzKubYxfHmWogVPihC-SSIBtIylyrBQE5kRX5Z8NtI/edit#gid=0  
2\. For Serum:  Counts performed using widget below.

  




  1. Triturated the obtained cell suspension 10 times (careful not to make bubbles) and transfer into trypan blue.
  2. Triturated the cells suspended in trypan blue at least 10 times (careful not to make bubbles) and transfer 10 uL onto haemocytometer.
  3. Performed cell count and enter details into Cell Count Calculator: 
  4. Repeat process to the second aliquot of cell resuspension to get the second cell count.     
Note: if the cell counts differ more than 10% of each other, perform a third
cell count.

  5. Average total cells in suspension : 19.965M (ACF) 17.928M (serum)
