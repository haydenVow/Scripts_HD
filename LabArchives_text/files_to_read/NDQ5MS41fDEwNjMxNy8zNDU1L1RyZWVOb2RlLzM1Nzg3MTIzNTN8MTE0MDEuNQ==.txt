Prepare scaffold:

  1. Transfer sterile scaffold from the biomaterial fridge into BSC.
  2. With sterile tweezers, remove one sample of the DaNaGreen scaffold and transfer onto a 100mm dish 
  3. Using the sterile tweezers and scalpel, cut into pieces - 3 pieces to fit into a 24 wp, and 5 pieces for a non - tissue culture treated 96wp. 




Phase imaging:

  1. Observe samples under phase microscope at 5x and 10x objective. Take images of each sample and include into lab book below:

Test with media:

  1. Add 1 mL of DMEM/F12 media into the 3 pieces of scaffold in the 24 wp. 
  2. Place scaffolds in the incubator: TIMESTAMP
  3. Observe scaffold over the next 5 days. Write any observations and the time below:
