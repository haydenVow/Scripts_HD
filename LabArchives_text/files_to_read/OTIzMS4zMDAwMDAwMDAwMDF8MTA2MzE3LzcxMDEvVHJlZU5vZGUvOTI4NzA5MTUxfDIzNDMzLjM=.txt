Took samples

  1. Sprayed down the sample line end with 70% ethanol.
  2. Connected a 5 mL sterile syringe.
  3. Withdrew 1 mL (first-draw)
  4. Disconnected sample syringe and transferred 1 mL of sample each to 1.5 mL Eppendorf tubes for cell count
  5. Connected a fresh sterile syringe and withdrew 1 mL of sample (second-draw).
  6. Disconnected sample syringe and transferred 1 mL of sample each to 1.5 mL Eppendorf tubes for cell count
  7. Sprayed sample line with 70% ethanol.
  8. Performed cell count:
    * 1st draw: discarded
    * 2nd draw: 308 000 cells/mL (739 200 000 total)

### Observations/Summary:

  * Navigated to https://192.168.0.250/ from a web browser window
  * Logged into the Biostat web app using the details in the operating manual (see reference).
    1. Username: "admin" (all lower case)

  * stirring speed: 70
  * pH: 7.60
  * dissolved oxygen: 44.4%
  * temperature: 37

Approximate cell count after seeding 50L RM bag:

~400 mL (left) / 2400 mL (original) * 2.2848B = 380.8M

Change in cell count:

380.8M -> 739.2M

  

Absorbance / Optical Density / Turbidity:

Volume used = 100 uL per well  

  * 3 reps of a blank (milliQ / dPBS)
  * 3 rep of draw 1
  * 3 reps of draw 2
