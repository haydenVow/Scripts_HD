50/50 RPMI/CHO + 1 mg/mL yeast + 0.02 mg/mL L-Ornithine monohydrochloride &
Putrescine dihydrochloride + 1 g/L poloxamer-188 + 0.0005 mg/mL IGF + 0.0001
mg/mL EGF (with 4 mM L-Glutamine & 6 g/L glucose final conc.)  
Main lab, incubator #86


Process
  
  
  1. Took 1 x 550 uL aliquot from E250 and performed count on ViCell
  2. Recorded counts in media results spreadsheet: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1cnmEz5amKSGmA9u3BJ-Dn0w-I7zFobBr6pG-UWCYaXM/edit#gid=595130609
    1. Cell count: 89,187,000 (959K cells/mL) 
  3. Removed 32 mL of cell suspension containing about 30M cells and dispensed into a new E250, leaing 61mL behind.
  4. Removed 29 mL of cell suspension from the remaining 61 mL, leaving about 32 mL behind containing about 30M cells.
  5. Added 64 mL of warmed 50/50 RPMI/CHO Nuvonis suspension medium + GFs (with glucose and L-glut) to flask to bring volume up to 100 mL in each E250 and cell seeding density to ~300K cells/mL 
  6. Returned flasks to incubator
