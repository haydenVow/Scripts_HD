NOTE: C2C12 media has previously not contains P38i however Bec suggested that
it would be a good idea to add it moving forward. P38i was added to the feed
media today and will be used hereafter.

Growth Media:

  * [x]  DMEM/F12 + 20% FBS + 1X P/S + P38i (10uM)

Total media required: 180ml

Total p38i required: 90ul




Reagent preperation

1\. Aliquotted   180mL  mL of  Growth Media into  1     tube(s). Placed in
water bath   10:45-11:05




T175 Process

2\. Removed  50  % of supernatant from vessel.

3\. Replaced with  15 mL (per well/per vessel) of  growth   media.

4\. Returned vessel to incubate at:

  * [x]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * [ ]  Bottom Binder Incubator

  




Cell factory Process

  1. Unscrew white cap and remove blue cap and place aside.
  2. Removed  `50`  % of supernatant (300 mL) from 1 x 2CF by carefully pouring into a waste container with 300mL marked.
  3. Replaced with  150 mL (per flask) of  `growth`   media by carefully pouring media through the white cap opening (alternatively you may use a 50mL serological to add media.)
  4. Place caps back and equalise 4CF by placing it on its side (blue cap on the bottom and white cap on the top, see image below:)  
  

4\. Returned vessel to incubate at:

  * [x]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * [ ]  Bottom Binder Incubator
