Procedure
  
  
Prepare plates

  1. Prepare plate with Anti-adherence coating and fill will fresh growth media according to experimental plan.
  2. Parafilm plates before closing the lid (sterile-side down, facing wells, as demonstrated in image below) & then parafilm lids and plates together (same fashion as is done for fix and stained plates in fridge) for transport to Garvan 12:30

  




Prepare FACS buffer

  1. Prepare 20mL of FACS buffer (PRF DMEM/F12 + 2% FBS).
    1. 400uL FBS + 19.6mL PRF DMEM/F12
  2. Sterile filter through a 0.2 µm filter.
  3. Store at 4ºC until needed. 10:50




1.Harvest CHOMP fibroblasts (2x T175 flasks)

2\. Pellet CHO-S and retrieve a sample of cells (2M)

19 of the plates will be sorted with CHOMP_09 cells whilst the remaining plate
will be filled with CHO-S cells, so when performing the FACS the first 19
plates will be filled and then the cell sample switched to the CHO-S cells to
fill the final plate.

3\. Once cell pellet was generated after being retrieved from the E125 culture
flask:

  1. Re-suspended each pellet in 2 mL Growth Medium (can go up to 4 - 5mL if necessary, just keep in mind Hoechst is 100 X so if cell suspension is 5 mL, add 50 uL of Hoechst in the next step, etc.)
  2. Placed the FACS tube cell suspension on ice. 13:30




Prepare 2 styrofoam boxes to transfer to the Garvan

2 Box with:

  * Pre-filled (medium) multi-well plates, parafilmed (20 total)
  * An ice pack
  * Hoechst (ddH20) - vial is located in large new fridge in library lab, top shelf of door in 70 mL urine container
  * Extra FACS Buffer
  * Tube containing cells




Hoechst - m8144

FACS buffer - m9169
