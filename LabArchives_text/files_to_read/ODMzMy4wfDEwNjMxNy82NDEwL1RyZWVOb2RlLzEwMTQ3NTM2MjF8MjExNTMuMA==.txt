Procedure


PREPARE DESTINATION VESSELS

  1. Removed adherent and suspension media mixes from the fridge (See FACS preparation lab book entry for this EPIC) 
  2. 8 x 384 well ultra low attachment plates were filled with 50uL of Hycell Cho growth media. 
  3. 2x 384 well adherent plates were filled with 50uL of DMEM/F12 + 20% FBS + 1xP/S growth media. 
  4. 5mL of Hycell Cho growth media was added to 3 x 50mL bioreactor tubes. 
  5. 12mL of DMEM/F12 + 20% FBS + 1xP/S growth media was added to 3 x T75 flasks. 
  6. 384 well plates were parafilmed before closing the lid (sterile-side down, facing wells, as demonstrated in image below) & then lids and plates were parafilmed together (same fashion as is done for fix and stained plates in fridge) for transport to FACS sorting facility. 
  7. Media for bioreactor tubes and flasks were placed in the water bath at 30 degrees to warm.




Passaging of PTEN and PABPC1 knockouts  
  
Cultures 10303 and 10305 were removed from the incubator for passage around
10:50am.  
Plates were transported from the Library lab into the Main lab for passage
since there was no available hood space




PASSAGING OF NUCLEOFECTED CELLS

1\. Took 2 x images of each vessel with microscope on phase setting (4X to
assess confluence)

2\. Aliquoted the required volume of each reagent below, placed all aliquots
to warm in the bead bath for a minimum of 20 minutes prior to use:

  1. TrypLE:   72   mL across   1 x 120 ml  container.
  2.  dPBS (for neutralising & washing):   140   mL across 2x 120mL containers (70mL each) 
  3. Growth medium (DMEM/F12 + 20% FBS + 1xP/S) (for cell counting after passage):   9 mL

3\. Time that all aliquots were placed in the water bath the warm before use
10:50 am  

Note: if aliquots were placed in water bath at different time, record the time
stamp for each individual solution.

The cells meant to go into suspension cultures were passaged before lunch- the
passage started at around 11 am- whereas the cells meant to go into adherent
culture or FACS sorting were passaged after lunch- the passage started at
around 13:00.  

  * Group 1 (suspension cultures): PABPC1/PTEN knockout & wild type
  * Group 2 (adherent cultures): PABPC1/PTEN knockout & wild type 
  * Group 3 (FACS sorting): PABPC1/PTEN knockout 

* * *

4\. Washed each well GENTLY with 2mL of dPBS (warmed).

5\. Added   2  mL tryple to each well and incubated at 37˚C.

  1. Start/Finish for TrypLE was
    1. Group 1 (suspension cultures): PABPC1/PTEN knockouts  11:14-11:20 & wild type  11:17-11:23 & ; 13:21-13:26  

    2. Group 2 (Adherent cultures): PABPC1 knockout   13:21-13:26 ; PTEN knockout  13:18-13:23 ; wild type  13:20-13:25  

    3. Group 3 (FACS sorting):  PABPC1 knockout   13:21-13:26 ; PTEN knockout  13:18-13:23 ; wild type  13:20-13:25

6\. Empty wells were neutralised with  2 ml  of dPBS.

7. Used growth media, dPBS, tryple used to detach the cells and dPBS to neutralise the tryple, as well as the cells themselves were pooled into a 50mL tube in their respective groups (three different tubes per group).

7\. Centrifuged at 300 x g for 5 min.

  1. Group 1 (suspension cultures): PABPC1/PTEN knockouts & wild type  11:25 - 11:30   

  2. Group 2 (Adherent cultures): PABPC1/PTEN knockouts & wild type   13:33-13:38   

  3. Group 3 (FACS sorting):  PABPC1/PTEN knockouts & wild type   13:33-13:38  

8\. Aspirated the supernatant(s).

9\. Resuspended pellet(s) in  Group 1: Hycell Cho media; Group 2: DMEM/F12 +
20% FBS + 1X P/S; Group 3: FACS sorting media   medium. If medium is really
cloudy/we have lots of cells/cells are pelleting themselves by gravity, go
with 4 mL. If less cells, clearer cell suspension etc., go with 2 mL.  

10\. Aliquoted 10uL of cell suspension for counting using a hemocytometer, and
performed the necessary dilution with Trypan blue (see Cell Count
Spreadsheet).

11\. Cell suspension was counted and the cell concentration and total cell
number was determined for each group

  1. Group 1 (suspension cultures): PABPC1 knockout  4 M ; PTEN knockout  4.5 M & wild type  2.1 M   

  2. Group 2 (Adherent cultures): PABPC1 knockout  1.76 M ; PTEN knockout  2.2 M & wild type  2.4 M  

  3. Group 3 (FACS sorting):  Did not perform counts
