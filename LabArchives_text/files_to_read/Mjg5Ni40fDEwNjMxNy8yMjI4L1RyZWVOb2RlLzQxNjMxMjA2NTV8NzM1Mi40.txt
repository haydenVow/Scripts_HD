# Procedure

Preparation

Collected:

  1. 1 x 15 mL black tube of dPBS labelled "dPBS for DAPI LL" (from "Biomaterials" fridge - this is pre-measured for the final DAPI-stain step) 
  2. 1 x 70 mL pot of 4% PFA labelled "LL PFA 1-July" (from "Biomaterials" fridge - this is leftover from last week, I think there is enough left for this task because you'll need <3 mL) 

Collected from incubator

  1. Culture plate (Plate ID: 7213-C2C12-Mouse P3-1of1) 

dPBS washes

  1. Poured non-sterile dPBS into trough. Using multichannel pipette, aspirated media from scaffolds (used caution to not stab or scrape scaffolds while pipetting) 
  2. Added 200 uL per well of dPBS to each scaffold and incubated for 5 min. Repeat twice. 
    1. Timestamp wash 1: 12:09 - 12:14
    2. Timestamp wash 2: 12:15 - 12:20
    3. Timestamp wash 3 12:20 - 12:25 
  3. Poured thawed PFA into trough. Aspirated PBS from scaffolds and replaced with 200 uL per well of PFA. Incubated for 15 minutes. Timestamp 12:28 - 12:43
  4. Additional wash with 200 uL PBS 12:45 - 12:53
  5. While scaffolds were incubating in PFA, added 4 uL of DAPI to black 15 mL tube containing dPBS. Pipette-mixed thoroughly to ensure even distribution through dPBS. 
  6. Aspirated PFA from scaffolds. Replaced with 200 uL DAPI solution and incubated for 5 min in the dark. Timestamp 12:54 - 12:59
  7. Aspirated DAPI solution from scaffolds. Replaced with dPBS and incubated for 5 min. Repeat once. 
    1. Timestamp wash 1 13:00 - 13:05
    2. Timestamp wash 2 13:07 - 13:12 
  8. Re-filled wells with 200 uL of dPBS. Parafilmed plate, wrapped with foil and stored in "Biomaterials" fridge.
