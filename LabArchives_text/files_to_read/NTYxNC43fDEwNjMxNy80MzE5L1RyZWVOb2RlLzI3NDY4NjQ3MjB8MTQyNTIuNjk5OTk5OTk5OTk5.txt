Aim/Purpose


To determine what the optimal rate of feeding is to maximise cell survival in
sheep MuSC differentiation, using both E6 media and 2% HS media. This aims to
troubleshoot the cell death that has been observed in Q3 of 2021.


Hypothesis


If 100% of the feed is changed everyday, then cell growth may be impaired.


Technical Gap


The issue of cell death needs investigation because we don't have definitive
evidence of the optimal feeding schedule that will promote survival. This is
imperative for successful cell differentiation and eventually, maturation.


Method/Procedure


  1. [Experiment Plan]
    * Get cells ready

Tuesday:

      * Coat 3x T flasks with gelatin (1 hr @37 deg)
      * Thaw cells (3 hrs) - in the BSC
        * Make up growth media (~500 mL) and warm in water bath
        * Warm cell vial in water bath
        * Add 0.5 mL growth media to vial
        * Allow to equilibrate
        * Add total vial volume (1 mL) to 90 mL aliquot of growth media that was made up earlier
        * Transfer ~30 mL of cell + media into each of the three gelatin coated T175 flasks
        * Incubate

Wednesday:

      * Make more growth media (at least 50 mL) and add p38i
      * Replace 50% feed from 3x T flasks

Friday:

      * Gelatin coat the 4x 96-WP (1 hr @37 deg)
      * Make growth media
      * Passage cells (add detatchment reagent, aspirate cells + feed, centrifuge and discard supernatant, resuspend cells in growth media) and seed onto 4x 96-WP
      * Seeding density = 640 cells / well

Sunday:

      * 50% feed, which Bec will take care of :)

Tuesday:

      * Cells should be confluent and ready for differentiation media
    * Differentiation assay

Tuesday (Day 0)

      * Change to differentiation media (E6 vs Basal Media + 2% HS control)
      * Lots of feeds (100% vs 50% vs 0%; changing daily vs every second day)
      * Refer to: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1DPzKubYxfHmWogVPihC-SSIBtIylyrBQE5kRX5Z8NtI/edit#gid=426699954&range=1:1)
      * Fix and stain plate "Day 0" plate and feed remaining three plates

Wednesday (Day 1)

      * Feed the "everyday" wells (3 plates)

Thursday (Day 2)

      * Feed all the wells (3 plates)

Friday (Day 3)

      * Feed "everyday" wells (3 plates)

Saturday (Day 4)

      * Fix and stain "Day 4" plate
      * Feed all the wells (2 plates)

Sunday (Day 5)

      * Feed "everyday" wells (2 plates)

Monday (Day 6)

      * Feed all the wells (2 plates)

Tuesday (Day 7)

      * Fix and stain "Day 7" plate
      * Feed "everyday" wells (1 plate)

Wednesday (Day 8)

      * Feed all the wells (1 plate)

Thursday (Day 9)

      * Feed "everyday" wells (1 plate)

Friday (Day 10)

      * Fix plate

Extra Info

Thought process: Thaw cells -> grow them up to sufficient numbers in the T
flask -> passage onto the assay plate -> grow them up till confluent ->
differentiate -> analyse

The aim of the experiment is to analyse the effect of the rate (and volume) of
diff media feeding on cell survival.

Each vial (0.5 mL) has 500,000 cells - dividing by the surface area of the T
flask (175 cm2) and then by the optimal seeding density (1000 cells / cm2)
gives us ~3 flasks. As such, if we use 3 flasks in the beginning, the seeding
density should be 948 cells / cm2  or roughly 166,666 cells per flask.

Regarding the growth media (90 mL of DMEM + F12 + 20% FBS + 1X P/S + 10mM
p38i) - the inhibitor needs to be added fresh, for every feed.

While growing, MuSCs take about 3 days to reach 60-70% confluence.
Differentiation of DOLLY12 takes about 14 days.

    * Staining Procedure

      1. Remove diff media
      2. Wash twice with PBS
      3. Fix with PFA -> (an "out" if required)
      4. Wash twice with PBS
      5. Permeabilise with PBS + TritonX (a detergent)
      6. Block non-specific binding sites
      7. IF stain - primary stain for MyoG (anti-MyoG) and anti-MF20 (for Myosin Heavy Chain; MHC) and then secondary stain
    * Image and Analyse

      1. Zaber imaging
      2. Analysis (ImageJ macros)
    * Write a report with conclusions
