### Process:

1\. Took image of vessel with microscope on phase setting.

3\. Aliquotted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then
placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath for a minimum of 20 minutes
prior to use:

  1. TrypLE:    10     mL in     1    tubes
  2.  dPBS (for neutralising):    10     mL
  3.  dPBS (for washing):      10   mL
  4. Growth media (for pellet resuspension):     4    mL

Time that all aliquots were placed in the water bath the warm before use
8:42 am

Note: if aliquots were placed in water bath at different time, record the time
stamp for each individual solution.




4\. Removed vessel(s) from the incubator     9:23   am

5\. Washed the vessel(s) with dPBS (warmed).

6\. Added     10    mL tryple to each vessel/well and incubated at 37ËšC.

  1. Start/Finish for TrypLE was     9:26   am 

7\. Neutralised with      10mL    dPBS and combined cell suspension into a
1    tube.

8\. Centrifuged at 650 x g for 5 min.

  1. Start/Finish time for centrifugation was    9 :45 am 




9\. Aspirated the supernatant(s).

10\. Resuspended pellet(s) in   4  mL   Growth   media    : am

11\. Aliquoted    10uL      of resuspended cells into a microcentrifuge tube
for cell count.

12\. Performed a cell count using the haemocytometer and recorded the cell
count data in the Google Doc spreadsheet: Cell Count Spreadsheet or cell count
widget below

  

  1. Total cell number was:       2,656,000    
  2. Volume of cell suspension required for subculture was:       all      




13\. Transferred       2mL    of cell suspension to 2 x 15mL tubes

Transport to Garvan 10:05 am
