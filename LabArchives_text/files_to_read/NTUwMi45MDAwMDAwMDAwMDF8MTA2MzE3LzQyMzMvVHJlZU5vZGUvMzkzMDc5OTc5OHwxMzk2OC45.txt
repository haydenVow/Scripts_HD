## Objective: Develop a scalable process to produce mature muscle.

(scalable refers to transferring findings to a bioreactor format to obtain
mature muscle fiber at tasteable proportions, maturation pertains to both
protein content per cell as well as mature striated muscle potentially
influencing product taste/texture)

### KR1: Build infrastructure to streamline maturation studies and accurately
analyse maturation markers

  * 0.1: Identified 3 opportunities to automate and increase the throughput of our pipeline
  * 0.2: Designed infrastructure. Protocols and consumables ready for implementation
  * 0.3: built first iteration and characterized prototype (dry test)
  * 0.5: first tested with cells, potential redesigned and rebuilt
  * 0.8: Optimized pipeline for robustness, operator time savings and accuracy
  * 1.0 Pipeline works every time with minimal standard deviation

### KR2: Increase late stage maturation markers by 10x compared to non-
stimulated baseline

starting with myosin or total protein, this could open up to other maturation
markers, such as striation, fusion index, myotube alignment or size)

  * 0.2 Action all items from the (possible causes of cell death) table to achieve cell survival
  * 0.4 Have a primary cell line capable of surviving the maturation process
  * 0.5 Tested above cell line in stimulation infrastructure with minimal effect on viability
  * 0.7 Significant improvement in maturation markers observed
  * 0.9 final target improvement in markers observed (e.g. 10x protein expression)
  * 1.0 maturation marker content increased by 10x in 3D matrix

### KR3: Investigate the (nutritional/culinary) benefits of mature muscle

what is the benefit of a mature muscle product? nutrient profile for mature
muscle vs myoblast/fibroblast? B12, carnithine, creatine, myoglobin.

targets-for-a-mature-muscle-product-at-Vow-0fc304c611254e6cbbf01c5bd5f16bbf

for next quarter: how can we improve the myoglobin content

  * 0.25 Identify metabolites present in mature muscle (add to existing data)
  * 0.5 Source and Implement suitable assays
  * 0.75 Measure baseline of metabolites in mature muscle vs myoblasts
  * 1.0 Measure baseline of metabolites in difference cell types/lines (myo vs fibro or DOLLY vs CHOMP)

THE MYOBLAST SONG

So many of us work on cells and DNA and protein gels

and western blots and cloning genes and RT-PCR.

But out of all I've seen in lab--both in the present and the past,

there's none I like as much as the ingenious myoblast.

A myoblast, a myoblast, the most amazing myoblast;

that's in the present or the past, the most ingenious myoblast.

A myoblast, a myoblast,  
it's what we all should try a blast;  
it's theirs or yours or his or hers  
or my-o-blast.

Their myogenic phenotype turns myoblasts into a pipe  
that's long and multinucleate and later turns to meat.  
You let them fuse, you let them bake--and then you've got a sirloin steak!  
We'd all be vegetarian if not for myoblasts.  
A myoblast, a myoblast, there's meat because there's myoblasts;  
and so we'd starve (at least we'd fast) if it were not for myoblasts.

A myoblast, a myoblast,  
it hasn't got a chloroplast  
because you never see in plants  
a my-o-blast.

They grow and die and die and grow and when they grow they grow so slow,  
but oh do I just love them so, primary myoblasts.  
You grow them in a culture dish--and then you hope and then you wish,  
and wonder why the cells all die, those evil myoblasts.  
The myoblasts, the myoblasts, those little evil myoblasts,  
that's in the present or the past, they die because they're myoblasts.

A myoblast, a myoblast,  
without them we would be harassed;  
oh what a useful object is  
a my-o-blast.

I'd love to stay and chat awhile, to run away is not my style;  
unfortunately I must go and babysit my cells.  
The cells will look like they're alright--and then they'll all die overnight.  
I haven't got a life because I'm growing myoblasts!  
Those myoblasts, those myoblasts, frustrating little myoblasts.  
I have no life; I am aghast, because I'm growing myoblasts.

A myoblast, a myoblast  
I promise this will be the last  
time that I sing to you about  
a my-o-blast!
