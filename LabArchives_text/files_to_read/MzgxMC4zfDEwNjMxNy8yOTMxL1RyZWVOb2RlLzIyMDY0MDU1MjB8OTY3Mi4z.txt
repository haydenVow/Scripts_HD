Aim/Purpose: To verify promising results seen with NANDO fibroblasts thawed directly into suspension culture
Hypothesis: NANDO fibroblasts thawed directly into suspension culture will have higher survival rates than those passaged from adherent culture
Technical Gap: We have only one replicate of fibroblasts thawed directly into suspension culture and so cannot be certain of the results
Method/Procedure


  1. [Experiment Plan]
  2. [Peer Review]
  3. [Make amendments and Sign off] 
  4. [Day 0 Monday July 26th] Thaw 1 x vial of chicken fibroblasts directly into 25mL of DMEM + 10% FBS + 1x PS + 1:100 anti-clumping agent in 1 x E125 flask and set to shake at 130rpm.
  5. [Day 2 Wednesday July 28th] 100% feed and count culture. Repeat every 48hrs for ~30 days or until the cells appear adapted, whichever comes first.
  6. If fibroblast viability is high but proliferation rates are non-existent or low, 100 ng/mL of IGF-LR3 and 100 ng/mL of FGF can be added to kick-start fibroblast proliferation.

After the lab work is complete:

  1. [Report writing (Draft)]
  2. [Review & fill out Report (Full)]
  3. [Ensure all lab books are complete & assign for review]
  4. [Review Lab Books, results, report]
  5. [Make necessary amendments and confirm with reviewer that experiment is complete
  6. [Release note on Project Updates]
