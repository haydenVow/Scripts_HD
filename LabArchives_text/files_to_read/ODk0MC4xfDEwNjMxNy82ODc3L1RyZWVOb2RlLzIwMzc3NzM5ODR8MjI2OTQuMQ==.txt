Process:

  

  1. Placed aliquots water bath  at 37C 16:45
  2. Removed   100 % of supernatant (140 uL) from vessel
  3. Replaced with   140L (per well) of  differentiation  media. 
  4. Imaged plate with phase on the Zaber
  5. Returned vessel to incubate at: 17:45

  * [X]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (aviary cells)

  

  * Incubator (119 ), Lab [Main/Library/Production]




  

  

Figure 1. Plate map of media conditions. Small molecules will be added to E6
media in 5 different concentrations (C1-C5) with an additional treatment using
C3 including FBS to ensure cell viability. Media conditions will be run in
duplicate. E6 media + horse serum will be used as a control and will be run in
triplicate




### Observations/Summary:

 100 % media changed on vessel(s)
