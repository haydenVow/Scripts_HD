  4. Removed    % of supernatant from vessel. 
  5. Replaced with    (per well/per vessel) of   media. Each well is a different condition. Make sure to change tips for every aspirate and dispense with your multichannel.
  6. Foil sealed media block (foil seals located on the shelf above the Primo)  \- and placed back in Biomaterials fridge for future feeds. Alternatively, you can seal the plates with sterile rubber mats and parafilm.
