AIM/PURPOSE: The overarching goal is to expand the Vows existing cell library
to include a broader range of cell types and species. Here, we aim to isolate
a plastic adherent populations of cells derived from avian embryonic tissue,
and to adapt these cells to growth in animal component free media where
possible.
