Experiments for data generation to train ML model

  

If attempting to achieve better 'counts' for wells with the ML model:

Experiment #1 (Perform on 6-10 x 384-well plates)

  

  * Add 25uL/well of Growth media to each well of the 384-well plates
  * Zaber scan (cell-free wells)
  * Harvest continuous culture cells; seed 25uL/well;
    * Cell suspension at conc 400 cells/mL will provide 10 cells per well
    * Cell suspension at conc 800 cells/mL will provide 20 cells per well
    * Cell suspension at conc 1600 cells/mL will provide 40 cells per well
    * Cell suspension at conc 3200 cells/mL will provide 80 cells per well
  * Leave overnight/or for few days depending on when it's seeded
  * Hoechst stain all wells (no need to remove Hoechst as plates will be discarded)
  * Zaber scan for Hoechst & Phase for all wells

  

Train model on Phase images (using Hoechst to label the cells).

  * This may contain errors in high confluence wells but worth a shot

  

Experiment #2 (Perform on multiple x 96-well plates)

  

  * Add 100uL/well of Growth media to each well of the 96-well plates
  * Zaber scan (cell-free wells)
  * Harvest continuous culture cells; seed 100uL/well;
    * Cell suspension at conc 100 cells/mL will provide 10 cells per well
    * Cell suspension at conc 400 cells/mL will provide 40 cells per well
    * Cell suspension at conc 1600 cells/mL will provide 160 cells per well
    * Cell suspension at conc 4800 cells/mL will provide 480 cells per well
  * Leave overnight/or for few days depending on when it's seeded
  * Hoechst stain all wells (no need to remove Hoechst as plates will be discarded)
  * Zaber scan for Hoechst & Phase for all wells

  

  

Experiment #3 (Perform on multiple x 24-well plates)

  

  * Add 250uL/well of Growth media to each well of the 96-well plates
  * Zaber scan (cell-free wells)
  * Harvest continuous culture cells; seed 250uL/well;
    * Cell suspension at conc 200 cells/mL will provide 50 cells per well
    * Cell suspension at conc 1000 cells/mL will provide 250 cells per well
    * Cell suspension at conc 2000 cells/mL will provide 500 cells per well
    * Cell suspension at conc 8000 cells/mL will provide 4000 cells per well
  * Leave overnight/or for few days depending on when it's seeded
  * Hoechst stain all wells (no need to remove Hoechst as plates will be discarded)
  * Zaber scan for Hoechst & Phase for all wells

  

Experiment #4 (Perform on multiple x 6-well plates)

  

  * Add 3mL/well of Growth media to each well of the 96-well plates
  * Zaber scan (cell-free wells)
  * Harvest continuous culture cells; seed 500uL/well;
    * Cell suspension at conc 100 cells/mL will provide 50 cells per well
    * Cell suspension at conc 1000 cells/mL will provide 500 cells per well
    * Cell suspension at conc 2000 cells/mL will provide 1000 cells per well
    * Cell suspension at conc 4000 cells/mL will provide 2000 cells per well
  * Leave overnight/or for few days depending on when it's seeded
  * Hoechst stain all wells (no need to remove Hoechst as plates will be discarded)
  * Zaber scan for Hoechst & Phase for all wells

  

  

  

If attempting to achieve 'confluence' reading for wells:

  

Experiment #1 (Perform on 4-6 x 384-well plates)

  * Add 25uL/well of Growth media to each well of the 384-well plates
  * Zaber scan (cell-free wells)
  * Harvest continuous culture cells; seed 25uL/well;
    * Cell suspension at conc 400 cells/mL will provide 10 cells per well
    * Cell suspension at conc 800 cells/mL will provide 20 cells per well
    * Cell suspension at conc 1600 cells/mL will provide 40 cells per well
    * Cell suspension at conc 3200 cells/mL will provide 80 cells per well
  * Leave overnight/or for few days depending on when it's seeded
  * CMFDA stain all wells (will require removing CMFDA to minimise background)
  * Maintain cultures for 3 days;
    * Day 1: Zaber scan for AF488 (cell cytoplasm) & Phase for all wells
    * Day 2: Zaber scan for AF488 (cell cytoplasm) & Phase for all wells
    * Day 3: Zaber scan for AF488 (cell cytoplasm) & Phase for all wells

  

Train model on Phase images (using AF488 (CMFDA) overlap to label the cells
fluorescently).

  * This may contain errors in high confluence wells but worth a shot
