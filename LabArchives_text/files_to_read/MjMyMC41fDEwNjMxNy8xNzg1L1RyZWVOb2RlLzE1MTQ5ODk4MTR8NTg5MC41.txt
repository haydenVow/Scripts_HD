Process:

1\. Aliquotted   7.5 mL  mL of  E6, 1mM creatine E6, 5mM creatine E6, 10mM
creatine E6   into   70 mL   sterile container. Placed in water bath   9:23 -
9:37  

2\. Using a multichannel pipette, removed   100 % of supernatant from vessel.
(you can use the same tips for the same conditions)

3\. Using a multichannel pipette with four tips attached, replaced with  140
uL  (per well) of  E6  media. (Four tips can fit into the 70 mL sterile
container). Repeat with remaining media in the correct columns. (Refer to
plate map)  

4\. Returned vessel to incubate at: 10:08

  * [x]  37ÂºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * Incubator (# Thermo ), Lab [Main]
