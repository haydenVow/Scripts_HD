Aim/Purpose


To adapt F_DOLLY12 cells to suspension

To test the effect of BDNF, EGF, and HGF on suspension adaptation of F_DOLLY12


Hypothesis


The addition of either BDNF, EGF, or HGF to CD-CHO + KSR + 10G media will
allow better suspension adaptation of F_DOLLY12 cells (as measured by cells/mL
throughout the process)


Technical Gap


We have so far been unable to successfully adapt cells to suspension culture.
Our previous results suggest that adapting DOLLY12 cells in CD-CHO + 10% KSR +
6G may be a promising approach. However, we have not tested the effect of
adding growth factors such as EGF, HGF, and BDNF in media when adapting cells
to suspension.


Method/Procedure


Things to note

  * Cells will be harvested when the flasks reach ~100% confluence, hence being unable to assign a specific day for seeding
  * The base/control medium for the DOLLY experiment is CD CHO + 10% KSR + 1:100 ACA + 1:100 glutamax +  1xP/S + 100 ng/mL IGF + 100 ng/mL FGF  and Hycell CHO + 10% KSR + 1:100 ACA + 1:100 glutamax  \+ 1xP/S + 100 ng/mL IGF + 100 ng/mL FGF    
The base/control medium for the CHOMP experiment is CD CHO + 20% KSR + 1:100
ACA + 1:100 glutamax + 1xP/S + 100 ng/mL FGF + 100 ng/mL 100 ng/mL IGF + 100
ng/mL FGF and Hycell CHO+ 20% KSR + 1:100 ACA + 1:100 glutamax + 1xP/S + 100
ng/mL IGF and 100 ng/mL  FGF

    * The medium can be prepared ahead of time without the KSR and growth factors. When preparing the medium for the experiment, leave 10% or 20% of volume free for KSR addition. 
    * The KSR and 100 ng/mL FGF/IGF as well as the designated growth factors (EGF, HGF, BDNF) will be added on the day of feeding directly to media aliquots
