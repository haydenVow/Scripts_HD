Gibco: Set 4 (2x10CS) 50% Feed with VitC ONLY & Set 5 (2x10CS) 100% Treatment with TGFb + VitC


Observations:  
long thick worm like aggregates have formed in the flasks. They are too long
and thick to come out when pouring out media. But when pouring in new media,
cell sheets come off the surface. For aggregates that did come out when
pouring out media, they were sucked back up with a strippette and put back
into the flask after media change. For aggregates that got stuck in the neck
when pouring out, a stripette was used to push them down into the bottom layer
of the flask after equalibriation following media change. Cell aggregates kept
their shape and did not break apart from the force of the pipette.

Procedure - Set 4 50% Feed (ONLY VitC) & Set 5 100% Treatment (TGFb + VitC)

  1. Turn on the water bath and set to 37'C.
  2. Aliquot required growth media into a sterile container/s and add:
    1. Set 4: ONLY Vitamin C (aka LAA2P) at a working concentration of 50ug/mL 
    2. Set 5:  Vitamin C (aka LAA2P) at a working concentration of 50ug/mL + TGFb at a working concentration of 10ng/mL
  3. Place in the water bath and heat for at least 20 minutes. 
  4. Transfer flasks to the BSC, wiping with 70% EtOH. Discard media from the flask. 
  5. Replace the required amount of the media in selected flasks (Sets 4 and 5) with the correct treated media. Return to incubator and note the Flask ID.
