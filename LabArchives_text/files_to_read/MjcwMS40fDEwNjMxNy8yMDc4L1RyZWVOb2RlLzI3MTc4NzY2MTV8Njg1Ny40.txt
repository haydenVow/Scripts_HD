Reactor: Yoghurt maker with perfusion ports, gas sparging and stir bar, dish
rack to hold samples (WASH-E)

Start date: 23/06/21

Operator: CO, SS

Dish seeding:

  1. C2C12 cells were seeded at XXXX cells/mL (total cells per dish) into 60 mm cell culture dishes
  2. After remaining in growth media for 4h to 1day to grow to confluence, cells were transferred into the BSC and media removed
  3. Dishes were inserted into the dish rack at various heights, see below)

Reactor preparation:

  1. assembly and all relevant tubing and connectors were wrapped in aluminum foil and dry-autoclaved at 120C for 15 min
  2.  Afterwards, the assembly was placed on the lab bench to dry (still wrapped in foil)
  3.  Assembly was ethanol-sprayed, transferred into the BSC and unwrapped
  4. The lid was assembled with all ports connected to the relevant tubing. 
    1. Tubing facing outward were capped with 0.22um luer lock syringe filters to maintain sterility. This applies to the gas inlet and gas outlet ports
    2. the 3rd port was blocked by inserting a 500 uL sterile tube
  5. The reactor volume was filled with 2.5 L of fresh E6 media, equilibrated to 37C in the waterbath for 2h
  6. The dish rack was unwrapped and loaded with the previously seeded cells in 60 mm dishes (see culture IDs and positions below)
  7. once loaded the dishrack was submerged in the E6 towards the glass wall and away from the gas sparging tube
  8. a stir bar was carefully added on the gas sparging side, taking caution not to magnetically attach the bar to the dishrack
  9. the entire assmebly was sealed with parafilm after applying the lid
  10. Assembly was transferred into a prewarmed waterbath with sous-vide to maintain 37C
  11. Gas tubing was connected and sparging started at normoxic conditions
  12. the waterbath was wrapped in alufoil for light protection and the stir bar activated slowly, again avoiding magnetic attachment to the dishrack
