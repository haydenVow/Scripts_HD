Process:

1\. Aliquotted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then
placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath for a minimum of 20 minutes
prior to use:

  1. TrypLE:    30   mL in   1x 50 mL    tube
  2. dPBS (for neutralising)    60   mL in    1x 70 mL    pot
  3. Growth media (for pellet resuspension):    5  mL 
  4. Growth media (for seeding):    300   mL in    1x 500 mL    pot
  5. Times that all aliquots were placed in the water bath to warm before use    10:10  

Note: if aliquots were placed in water bath at different times, record the
time stamp for each individual solution.




2\. Washed the flask(s) with dPBS.

3\. Added    10   mL tryple to each vessel/well and incubated at 37˚C for
16    min.

Note: Fibroblasts typically require 15-18 minutes of incubation with tryple,
slightly longer than MuSCs.

  1. Start/Finish time for tryple was    10:29    \-    10:45     

4\. Neutralised with    10 mL   dPBS (warmed) and combined cell suspension
into a    2x 50 mL   tubes.

5\. Centrifuged at 650 x g for 5 min

  1. Start/Finish time for centrifugation was  10:54 - 10:59




6\. Aspirated the supernatant(s)

7\. Resuspended pellet(s) in      5  mL     growth  media.

8\. Performed a cell count using the haemocytometer and recorded the cell
count data in the Google Doc spreadsheet called 'Cell Count Spreadsheet' (see
link below):

SSIBtIylyrBQE5kRX5Z8NtI/edit#gid=0

9\. Total cell number was:    10,782,400  




10\. Seeded ~7k cells per cm2 of the flasks/plates. Note that fibroblasts
prefer to be subcultured closely together.

11\. Volume of cell suspension required for subculture was:    5000 uL  

12\. Transfer   5000 µL of cell suspension to the pre-warmed  300 mL Growth
Media.

13\. Transfer cell suspension into (non-gelatin coated)     1x 2CF
flasks/plates.

14\. Transfer flask/plate(s) to incubate at:

  * [x]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (aviary cells)
