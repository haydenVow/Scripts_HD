### Process:

1\. Took image of vessel with microscope on phase setting.

2\. Gelatin coated      2    x    2cf      vessel with sterile filtered 0.1%
gelatin solution and then incubated all coated flasks at 37˚C.

  1. Time when all vessels(s) placed into the incubator     18  :  50 pm 

3\. Aliquotted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then
placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath for a minimum of 20 minutes
prior to use:

  1. TrypLE:   200      mL in    1     tubes
  2.  dPBS (for neutralising):     200    mL
  3.  dPBS (for washing):    200     mL
  4. Growth media (for pellet resuspension):      100   mL
  5. Growth media (for seeding):    500    mL 

Time that all aliquots were placed in the water bath the warm before use   19
: 10  pm

Note: if aliquots were placed in water bath at different time, record the time
stamp for each individual solution.




4\. Removed vessel(s) from the incubator    19 : 40  a/pm

5\. Washed the vessel(s) with dPBS (warmed).

6\. Added     200    mL tryple to each vessel/well and incubated at 37˚C.

  1. Start/Finish for TrypLE was   19  : 42  pm 

7\. Neutralised with    200      dPBS and combined cell suspension into a
8x50ml    tube.

8\. Centrifuged at 650 x g for 5 min.

  1. Start/Finish time for centrifugation was   19  : 52  pm 




9\. Aspirated the supernatant(s).

10\. Resuspended pellet(s) in     10    mL    Growth      media   19  : 59
pm

11\. Aliquoted    10ul      of resuspended cells into a microcentrifuge tube
for cell count.

12\. Performed a cell count using the haemocytometer and recorded the cell
count data in the Google Doc spreadsheet: Cell Count Spreadsheet or cell count
widget below

  1. Total cell number was:           
  2. Volume of cell suspension required for subculture was:           
  3. Cell density per vessel:          




13\. Transferred           µl of cell suspension to the pre-warmed
mL Growth media:      :    a/pm

14\. Transferred cell suspension into the pre-gelatin coated
vessel.

15\. Left at RT in the BSC for 30 min to allow cells to settle      :  \-  :
a/pm  

16\. Transferred vessel(s) to incubate at:

  * [ ]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (avian cells)

Version Change Log

NameChange Details  
V1 (original)N/A  
V2Changed all sentences to past tense to better reflect a hand-written lab
book entry.  
Various formatting changes.  
Addition of more detail to step 2, removal of step 3. Replaced volume
requirements table with updated volumes @Sep 22, 2020  
Updated temperature selection for mammalian/aviary cells @Sep 23, 2020  
V3Included a section for 'vessel type' in passage ID table Replace
'flask/plate' with 'vessel' throughout lab book Include at step 1 to take
image of vessel on the microscope  
Mentioned that dPBS for washing should be warm - step 3(2) and 5.  
Added timepoint at step 4 for when vessel is removed from incubator  
Include at step 11 to aliquot cell resuspension into microcentrifuge tube  
Included at step 10 and 13 time point for when cell pellet is resuspended and
when resuspended cells is moved into growth media.  
Included p38i in table of regent used  
Combined two dPBS entries in 'Media/reagents' table Added 'cell density per
vessel'
