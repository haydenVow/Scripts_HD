Process:

1\. Manually scan through each plate and note down any observations and take
images of any viable cultures

  




Observations/Summary:

None of the cultures appear to contain any cell populations - leading
assumption is that the state of these sorted cells was unclear prior to
sorting (wherein it was unclear if it was in fact cells that were sorted or
just hoechst stained cellular debris)
