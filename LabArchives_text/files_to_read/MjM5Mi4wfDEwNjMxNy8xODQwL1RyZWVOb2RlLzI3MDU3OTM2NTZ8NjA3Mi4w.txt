Process:

1\. These cells were passaged yesterday and seeded in 500uL of media per well.
Conditions 4, 5 and 6 (ID 7123, 7124, 7125) need 800ug/mL of albumin added to
them. So, add 2uL of albumin (stock 1803) to each of these wells. Use a
separate tip for each well.

2\. Returned vessel to incubate at: 17:05
