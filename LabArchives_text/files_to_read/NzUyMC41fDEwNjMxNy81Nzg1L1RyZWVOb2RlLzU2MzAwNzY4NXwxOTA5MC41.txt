Process:

1\. Aliquotted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then
placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath for a minimum of 20 minutes
prior to use:

  1. Growth media (for seeding):    5   mL in    1x 15 mL   tube
  2. Times that all aliquots were placed in the water bath to warm before use   14:20 

Note: if aliquots were placed in water bath at different times, record the
time stamp for each individual solution.




2\. Centrifuge plates at 300 x g for 1 minute to pellet the cells

3\. Remove 70 uL of media from each well from the 384 ULA plate that needs to
be passaged.

4\. Add 70 uL of fresh growth media to the remaining 30 uL of cell/media
suspension into a new 384 ULA plate according to the table below (i.e., A4
will move into position A1 of the new plate)

5\. Repeat this process for the remaining wells
