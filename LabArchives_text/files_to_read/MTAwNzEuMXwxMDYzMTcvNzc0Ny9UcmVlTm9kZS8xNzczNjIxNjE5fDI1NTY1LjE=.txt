Observations

In all cultures except the RDG only culture, there appeared to be a large
number of non-viable cells in all cultures. The majority of the cells in
Nuvonis media + FGF2, initially appeared alive, but after 2 minutes in the
trypan stain, they began to take up the dye, indicating compromised cell
membranes. The cell counts listed bellow reflect the live cell counts after
approx 2 min in stain.

Process:  

  1. Place media in water bath >15min prior to use
  2. Collected vessels from shaker, wiped with ethanol-sprayed Rediwipe, and brought into BSC 
  3. Centrifuged 50 mL tubes at 400 x g for 5 mins 
  4. Aspirated  80% (8mL) of supernatant, taking extra care to not disrupt or aspirate pellet.
  5. Resuspended each pellet in the remaining 5mL of media, and took 2x 10ul samples from each culture for hemocytometer counts 
  6. Performed  hemocytometer counts (see below for counts).
  7. Topped up each 50 mL centrifuge tube with 8 mL of fresh pre-warmed media and mix
  8. Returned to incubator
