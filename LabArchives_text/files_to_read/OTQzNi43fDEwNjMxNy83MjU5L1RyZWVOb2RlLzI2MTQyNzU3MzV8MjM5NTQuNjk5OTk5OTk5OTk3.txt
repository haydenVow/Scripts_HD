Overview


BUFFY6 myoblasts in 2CFs (ID: ) are growing very slowly, seems to be due to
low levels of confluence during initial seeding phase. 10x T175s, previously
thawed for Sylvester (EPIC31107), are being repurposed for 'semi-scaled'
differentiation to compare methods at larger scale than well plate.
