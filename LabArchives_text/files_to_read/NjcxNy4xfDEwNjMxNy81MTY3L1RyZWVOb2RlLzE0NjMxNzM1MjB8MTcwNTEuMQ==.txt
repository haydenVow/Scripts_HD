### Process:

1\. Took image of vessel with microscope on phase setting.

2\. Aliquotted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then
placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath for a minimum of 20 minutes
prior to use:

  1. TrypLE:   dispensed directly from container  
  2.  dPBS (for neutralising & washing):   dispensed directly from container 
  3. Growth media (for pellet resuspension & seeding):   1  mL

Time that all aliquots were placed in the water bath the warm before use
12:02  

Note: if aliquots were placed in water bath at different time, record the time
stamp for each individual solution.




4\. Removed vessel(s) from the incubator     12:04  

5\. Washed the vessel(s) with dPBS (warmed).

6\. Added   0.05   mL tryple to each vessel/well and incubated at 37˚C.

  1. Start/Finish for TrypLE was    12:21 - 12:32    

7\. Neutralised with   200 uL    dPBS and combined cell suspension into     1
x 15 mL    tube.

8\. Centrifuged at 650 x g for 5 min.

  1. Start/Finish time for centrifugation was    12:38 - 12:43    




9\. Aspirated the supernatant(s).

10\. Resuspended pellet(s) in   0.1   mL     growth     medium     12:45  

11\. Aliquoted    10 uL   of resuspended cells into a microcentrifuge tube for
cell count.

12\. Performed a cell count using the haemocytometer and recorded the cell
count data in the Google Doc spreadsheet: Cell Count Spreadsheet or cell count
widget below

  1. Total cell number was:    3000   
  2. Volume of cell suspension required for subculture was:    100 uL (total suspension)   
  3. Cell density per vessel:   9375 cells/cm2   




13\. Transferred    100  µL of cell suspension to the pre-warmed   100 uL
Growth medium

14\. Transferred cell suspension into   well A2 of same 96-well plate  

15\. Transferred vessel(s) to incubate at:

  * [ ]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (avian cells)
  * [x]  30ºC, 5% CO2 (reptilian cells), incubator #68




Observations/Summary:

Cells moved from well A1 of 96-WP to well A2 of same plate
