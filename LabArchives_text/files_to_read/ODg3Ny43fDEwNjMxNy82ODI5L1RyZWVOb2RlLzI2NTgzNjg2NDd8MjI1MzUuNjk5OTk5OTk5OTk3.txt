### Process:

1\. Aliquotted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then
placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath for a minimum of 20 minutes
prior to use:

  1. TrypLE:     15    mL in     1 x 15 ml    tube
  2.  dPBS (for neutralising):      15   mL
  3.  dPBS (for washing):    15     mL
  4. dPBS (for pellet resuspension and wash off serum):     9    mL

Time that all aliquots were placed in the water bath the warm before use
15:32 - 16:01    pm

Note: if aliquots were placed in water bath at different time, record the time
stamp for each individual solution.




4\. Removed vessel(s) from the incubator     16:02  pm

5\. Washed the vessel(s) with dPBS (warmed).

6\. Added     5    mL tryple to each vessel/well and incubated at 37ËšC.

  1. Start/Finish for TrypLE was     16:12 - 16:20 pm 

7\. Neutralised with     5     dPBS and combined cell suspension into a     15
ml    tube.

8\. Centrifuged at 300 x g for 5 min.

  1. Start/Finish time for centrifugation was     16:32 - 16:3 pm 




9\. Aspirated the supernatant(s).

10\. Resuspended pellet(s) in     2    mL   dPBS for each target gene.  

11\. Separated cell suspension of each gene target into 2 x 1.5 ml tubes.

12\. Centrifuged and aspirated the supernatant.

13\. Froze down DNA extraction sample in the -20 freezer and the RNA
extraction sample in the -80 freezer.
