Growth Media:

  * [X]  DMEM/F12 + 20% FBS + 1X P/S + P38i (10uM)

  

Prepare materials for thaw and seed:

1\. Gelatin coated 1   x  96 well plate  flasks/plates with sterile filtered
0, 1, 5, 10, 20 mg/mL gelatin solution and then incubated all coated flasks at
37ºC

  * Time when all flasks placed into the incubator  N/A (Previously incubated) a/pm 

2\. Aliquotted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then
placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath for a minimum of 20 minutes
prior to use:

  *  Growth media (for seeding):    24mL in  Small Sample Container  tubes 
  * Time that aliquot was placed in the water bath to warm before use:   15:07 a/pm

## Thaw and seed vial:

3\. Collected the cryovial from Liquid Nitrogen storage & place in foam
floater in water bath for 5 min  15:04 - 15:09 a/pm

Location where cryovial was collected from:

Vial details:  2   x  500K  cryovials at  500K  cells each for a total of
1M  cells

Brew

Tower/Bucket #1  

Box/Cane #6  

Vial location:F1 F2  

Vial ID(s): #2907 #2908  

`4. Ethanol sprayed & transferred the vial(s) to the BSC.`

`5.  Added  500µL of Growth Media (to generate a total volume of 1mL in the
cryovial) to the cryovial, resuspended the cell suspension gently to reduce
osmotic shock. `

`6. Collected the entire 1mL of cell suspension & transfer into the pre-warmed
tube of Growth Media. `

`7. Using a 10mL serological pipette, resuspended & distributed the cells
evenly in the   24mL of pre-warmed Growth Media (prepared in Step 2). `

`8. Transfered   150uL to each pre-coated  well  and transferred plates to
incubator 15:39 a/pm `

`9. Transfered flask/plate(s) to incubate at: `

  * [X]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (aviary cells)

  

Making labels

Note - You will need to increase the passage number by one. (i.e. if your
thawed vial ID has a passage number of 3, when you make a culture ID for you
vessel you will need change the passage number to 4 on Airtable.)

  




SOPs used:

  * Thaw/Revival Template_V3

  

Summary:

Thawed C2C12 cells into 2 x 96 well plates (1 x ingredient, 1 x  coating)

  

***Condition 0 mg/mL may have less growth media and cells in the coating
plate***




### Results:

  * Results were;
    * [X]  As Usual (this is a repetitive task)
    * [ ]  Unexpected because...
    * [ ]  Need to be further analysed
    * [ ]  Other (.......)
