Cells look very similar (morphologically) in both conditions, the main visible
difference is that cells in 75/25 are a little clumpier than those in 50/50.
Both conditions doubling every ~24H

Process
  
  
  1. Took 1 x 50 uL sample from each flask
  2. Performed manual cell count (ViCell required tinkering with). Recorded counts in table.
  3. Transferred 2M cells from each culture to 6 x 50 mL centrifuge tube
  4. Centrifuged at 500 x g for 5 min
  5. Aspirated 100% of supernatant
  6. Added 20 mL respective medium to each tube and re-suspended pellets
  7. Strained cell suspensions using 40 um strainer into 6 x new E-125s 
    * Note: had to use old strainers with higher contamination risk, as we are still waiting on more of the new strainers 
  8. Replaced E125 in incubator at 37'C, 5% CO2, 120 RPM
