0) Locate all reagents and stock solutions and have them ready for use (see
previous entry for exact locations, allow reagents from the fridge to reach
room temperature before adding so as not to add cold solutions to your cells,
but do not leave fibrinogen or thrombin out on the bench for > ~1hr):

\- Proliferation media + ACA (fridge)  
\- 20mM CaCl2 in Proliferation media (fridge)  
\- Bovine concentrated plasma fibrinogen stock (8mg/ml) (fridge)  
\- ACA stock solution (room temp)  
\- Thrombin stock solution (10mg/ml) (fridge)

  

Preparation of fibrin gel with cells:

Method based on the work by Kaplan & Simsa et al., 2019:

Combine MuSCs at a minimum seeding density of 6 x 10^6 ** cells/well with the
prolif media + 20 mM CaCl2. (Also prepare n=3 cell free controls, i.e. add
media + 20mM CaCl2 only to 3 wells):

METHOD:

1) Pre-warm CaCl2 + Proliferation media mix (NO P38I) in the water bath at
37'c for at least 15min before use  14:19 - 14:37

2) Centrifuge down 27M cells 14:21 - 14:26pm. Resuspend 27 x 10^6 cells (6 x
10^6 cells/ml) in 1.85 mls of CaCl2 + Proliferation media (205ul x 9 cell-
laden samples)

3) Prepare 615ul of just proliferation media + 20mM CaCl2 (205ul x 3 cell free
samples)  
  
**NOTE - Kaplan & Simsa seeded their fibrin gels at 3.5 × 10^6 cells/well (per
sample). However, a higher density within the gel could improve cell-cell
contact and the likelihood of fusion and so I would suggest 6x10^6 cells per
well. The alternative would be to screen multiple seeding densities, however,
due to the high cost of the animal proteins, and the time required to culture
this many cells perhaps it is best to pick one density for this first
experiment.  
  

Add thrombin from bovine plasma (Sigma) with a total enzyme activity of 0.6 U
into each well (for all 12 samples):

4) Add 405ul of the 10mg/ml stock thrombin solution (45ul per 9 cell-laden
wells) to a 15ml falcon tube (tube 1) and 135ul of the 10mg/ml stock thrombin
solution to a separate 15ml falcon tube (45ul per 3 cell-free wells, tube
2)timestamp 15:10  

Note - our thrombin has ≥60 NIH units/mg protein (biuret), from a search
online one "NIH" unit is equivalent to 1.1 U of thrombin, so we would need to
add in around 0.09 mg per well (our scales are not sensitive enough for this).
So we have made up a stock conc and will add a small amount of this per well.
We made up a stock conc of 10mg of thrombin/ml of H2O, then we add 90ul per
well = 0.6U per well.

5) Add cell laden media CaCl2 mixture (or cell free CaCl2 media) to the
relevant tubes (see above plate map) with pre-added thrombin

\- to the first falcon tube (tube 1 containing 405ul of thrombin) add 1.85ml
of the cell/CaCl2 media suspension (cell-laden samples) timestamp 15:12  

\-  to the second falcon tube (tube 2 containing 135ul of thrombin) add 615ul
of the CaCl2-media only (D1-D3 cell free samples) timestamp 15:13  
  

Add the fibrinogen stock (8mg/ml) to the wells to make up a final
concentration of 3 mg/mL, so that each well has a total volume of 800 µL
(cell-reagent mix):

5) NOTE - ADD FIBRINOGEN TO THE CELL FREE TUBE (TWO) FIRST INCASE INSTANT
GELATION OCCURS  
  
To tube two add 450ul of the 8mg/ml fibronogen stock solution (150ul per cell-
free sample) timestamp 15:15  
  
To tube one add 1.35ml of the 8mg/ml fibronogen stock solution (150ul per
cell-laden sample)

6) Mix the solution quickly in each tube by pipetting up and down multiple
times.

Add the fibrinolytic inhibitor aminocaproic acid (ACA) (Sigma), at a
concentration of 1 mg/mL to the cell-Fibrin mix, to prevent rapid hydrogel
degradation:

7) Add 189ul of the 20mg/ml stock ACA to tube 1 (21ul per cell-laden sample)
and mix, then add 63ul of the 20mg/ml stock ACA to tube 2 (21ul per cell-free
sample)  

Each tube should now contain the following:

8) Place the anchor point inserts and conical inserts into the relevant wells
(see plate map below) timestamp 1  

Note - it is important that the inserts are added before the gels set!

9) Seed the plate/inserts:

For the anchor point inserts seed with 300ul per of gel-cell mix per insert
(seed around legs and between legs, see diagram below) n=4

For the conical inserts seed with 150ul gel-cell mix per insert, by pipetting
into the conical reservoir, n=4 (enough for n=9 if we have extra inserts!)

For insert free wells seed 300ul of gel into the middle of the well, n=4 cell
laden, n=3 for cell-free.

  

  

9) Once seeded, incubate the plates for at least 30 min, at 37 °C, to initiate
hydrogel polymerization. 15:04 -15:43pm

10) After 30 minutes, add ~1 mL (or enough to fully immerse samples but not
overflow - i.e. leave some headspace) of prewarmed proliferation media
(containing 1mg/ml ACA) to each well and return plates to the incubator (37
°C, 5% CO2).  timestamp 15:45  

Note - add media gently to the side of the wells, so as not to detach gels
from inserts

Observations:

When preparing fibrinogen controls, it was observed that upon adition of
fibrinogen (to the Mastermix of other 3 components) almost immediate gelation
occured. Onkly 2 control gel could be seeded out before the rtest of the stock
became a solid gel blob.

Therefore, the cell containing samples were processed in a different manner:

1\. cells in Calcium-sontaining media were mixed with fibrinogen and ACA

2\. these mixes were then aliquotted out into the intended wells and inserts
on the plate, followed by addition of the respective volume of thrombin

Most samples could be dispensed this way except 1 each of the cell-laden
controls and 1 anchor point insert before gelation of the mastermix (no
thrombin added!) occured.

all samples which had already undergone some gelation, most likely due to the
addition of calcium, were then treated withy Thrombin to finalize gelation in
the incubator.

After 30 min, all gels had set and were covered with ACA-containing media

  

Seeded according to plate map below:
