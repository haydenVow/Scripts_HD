50/50 RPMI/CHO + 1 mg/mL yeast + 0.02 mg/mL L-Ornithine monohydrochloride &
Putrescine dihydrochloride + 1 g/L poloxamer-188 + 0.0005 mg/mL IGF + 0.0001

Main lab, top shaking incubator #159


Process
  
  
  1. Took 1 x 550 uL aliquot from E250 and performed count on ViCell
  2. Recorded counts in media results spreadsheet: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1cnmEz5amKSGmA9u3BJ-Dn0w-I7zFobBr6pG-UWCYaXM/edit#gid=595130609
  3. Transferred 50 mL of cell suspension from each E250 into 2 x E500s (~60M per flask) 
  4. Added 150 mL of warmed 50/50 RPMI/CHO Nuvonis suspension medium + GFs (with 6g/L glucose and 4 mM L-glut) to flask to bring volume up to 200 mL in each E550 and cell seeding density to ~300K cells/mL 
  5. Returned flasks to incubator
