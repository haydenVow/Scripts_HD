Process

  1. Made up 0.1% PFA in PBS in a 50mL urine pot and leave at 4 degrees. Placed in fridge 14:22
  2. Removed the plunger from a 5-10ml syringe and trimmed either side of the top circular piece (opposite end of the rubber plunger) leaving a rectangular strip of plastic 3-5mm in width and 1-2cm in length.
  3. Cut a piece of 1-2g off the largest biopsy collected (Note: ideally this should be rectangular in shape with the long side running with the grain of the muscle so, muscle fibres should run down the long side. The piece should be no more than 10mm X 5mm X 5mm (at most, it needs to be small enough to fit on the end of a syringe). 
  4. Placed the piece of muscle into 0.1% PFA and put into the refrigerator for 60mins. 14:45   

  5. Washed the muscle piece 3x5min in PBS

  6. Transferred liquid nitrogen from the transport dewar to a styrofoam esky to a depth of ~3cm
  7. Filled a urine container with 20-30mL of isopropanol.
  8. Punched a hole in the lid of all 1.5mL tubes required to store samples using a pair of sterile scissors.
  9. Placed the isopropanol container into the liquid nitrogen (do not allow liquid nitrogen to spill and mix with isopropanol).
  10. Once the isopropanol began to visually freeze, (it should visually turn white) proceeded with O.C.T mounting.
  11. Placed a biopsy piece onto the face of the trimmed plunger and covered with O.C.T mounting medium.
  12. When 10% of isopropanol had frozen dipped the biopsy piece into the isopropanol for 5 seconds.
  13. Used forceps to transfer the frozen sample in OCT to one of the 1.5mL tubes and placed immediately into liquid nitrogen surrounding the urine container.
    1. Time the vial was transferred into -80C freezer 16:12

\- NOTE 1: If using posiclick tubes (ie. with click lids) PLEASE punch a small
hole in the top of the lid, this will prevent the tube from exploding when it
is removed from the -80C freezer.

\- NOTE 2: If possible, please use certified DNase/RNase free tubes for the
genomic samples
