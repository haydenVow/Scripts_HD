Process:

  1. Mixed culture with p1000
  2. Took 100 uL sample and performed cell count:
    1. Count 1: 10.0 cells per square x 10,000 squares/mL x 10 (dilution factor) = 1 million cells/mL x 20 mL = 20 million cells
    2. Count 2: 13.4 cells per square x 10,000 squares/mL x 10 (dilution factor) = 1.34 million cells/mL x 20 mL = 26.8 million cells
    3. Average = 23.4 million cells
  3. Aliquotted  180 mL  mL of  __ Media 
  4. Placed in water bath   12:35
  5. Transferred culture to E500 flask
  6. Added with   180mL of warm growth medium
  7. Returned vessel to incubate at: 12:55

  * [X]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (aviary cells)

  

  * Incubator (# 116 ), Lab [Main/Library/Production]




### Observations/Summary:

Cells had not grown appreciably over 3 days

Macroscopic aggregates had formed

Trituration with p1000 did not break up aggregates
