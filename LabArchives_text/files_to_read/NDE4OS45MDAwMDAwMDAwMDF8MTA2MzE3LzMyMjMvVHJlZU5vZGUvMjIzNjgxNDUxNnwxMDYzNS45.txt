Animal Source

The limbs of a male Salt Water Crocodile limbs have been sourced from Koorana
Crocodile Farm, 65 Savages Rd, Coowonga QLD 4702 and will be transported to
the Vowse in a chilled Esky.




Experimental plan  
Overview  
  
1 biopsy of approx. 4-6g each should be taken for digestion types. A total of
7 biopsies will therefore be needed (additional three to be stored for genomic
/ proteomic and histological analyses).

Biopsies should be taken from the superficial muscles of the quadriceps
equivalent on the two hindlimbs. This will be at the front of the top of the
leg (above the knee, blue muscles in top left image below).  If possible,
please list as either left or right leg.  
  

Digestion type 1. Standard collagenase + dispase isolation as previously
performed at Vow.  
Digestion type 2. As above but all steps normally performed at 37C are
performed at 30C.  
Digestion type 3. Trypsin digestion- Wash tissue, macerate and incubate with
0.1% trypsin-EDTA solution in PBS at 30 C with agitation. Collect supernatant
and add fresh trypsin at 30 minute intervals (for up to 1.5hrs). Pass
supernatant through a cell strainer and collect cells by centrifuging at
400xg. Combine cells.  
Digestion type 4. Outgrowth - Macerated tissue plated immediately.  
  
Digestion 1. Should then be further processed as follows.  
A. 1x Immediately culture at 37C w/ 5% CO2 in [DMEM/F12 + 20% FBS + P/S]  
B. 4 x Frozen as crude homogenate (in cryoprotectant media)  
  
Digestion 2 & 3 Should then be further processed as follows.  
A. 1x Immediately pre-plate and culture at 37C w/ 5% CO2 in [DMEM/F12 + 20%
FBS + P/S]  
B. 1x Immediately pre-plate and culture at 30C w/ 5% CO2 in [DMEM/F12 + 20%
FBS + P/S]  
C. 1x Immediately pre-plate and culture at 30C w/ 5% CO2 in [M199 + 20% FBS +
P/S]  
D. 2 x Frozen as crude homogenate

Digestion 4 Should then be further processed as follows.  
A. 1x Immediately plate and culture at 37C w/ 5% CO2 in [DMEM/F12 + 20% FBS +
P/S]  
B. 1x Immediately plate and culture at 30C w/ 5% CO2 in [DMEM/F12 + 20% FBS +
P/S]  
C. 1x Immediately plate and culture at 30C w/ 5% CO2 in [M199 + 20% FBS + P/S]
