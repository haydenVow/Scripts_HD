Notes  

After isolation, please split the crude homogenate into 4 equal portions and
freeze 3/4 of them.  1 portion from each biopsy should be placed into
immediate culture. See lab book here: https://au-

Cut off any adherent fat/connective tissue (don't spend ages doing this, just
anything large clearly hanging off). Get the biopsy into a dish sooner rather
later to prevent it from drying out.

  

179: 4.7g

Transfer small pieces of the tissue to the lid and using forceps to hold the
tissue at one end and two scalpels, mince each muscle piece until it is
slushed sufficiently. Then proceed to transfer the next piece, repeat until
all are homogeneously slushed.

Transfer the minced muscle to a 50 mL conical tube up to 10mL of MDB (freshly
prepared and filtered).

  

  

  

  
  
  
Seal the tube well with Parafilm and incubate in a 37°C water bath with
agitation (60rpm) for 1 hour.  Tubes should be positioned horizontally along
the shaking path and completely submerged in water. Use weights to keep the
tubes submerged.

Turn on centrifuge Remove frozen aliquot Stock dispase solution to thaw Remove
an aliquot of freshly prepared Stock Collagenase solution from -20ºC. Prepare
in hood: waste container/tube, 5mL serological pipettes

  

13:33

Fill each tube to 50 ml with cold WM. Gently invert a few times to mix.  

  

  

  
  
Centrifuge in a swinging bucket rotor at 500 x g for 5 min  

13:36-13:41

  

13:36-13:41

  
  
  
Aspirate supernatant down to about 8 mL.

CRITICAL STEP: The pellet at the bottom after centrifugation is loose and can
be easily disturbed. Control the aspiration strength and always aspirate only
from the surface of the supernatant

  
  
  
Add 1 mL stock Collagenase II solution and 1 mL stock Dispase solution to the
tube and Resuspend the pellet with a 5-mL serological pipette. Triturate
(pipette up & down) 10-15 times or until the suspension travels up and down
the pipette smoothly without clogging.  

  
  
  
 Seal the tube well with Parafilm and incubate in a 37°C water bath with
agitation (60-70 rpm on the recommended model of shaking water bath) for 30
min.    ` `

If the muscle is well digested, triturate through a 10mL serological pipette.

If there are still muscle chunks, `using a 10 mL syringe and 20-gauge needle,
aspirate and eject the muscle suspension in and out of the syringe 10 times.`

CRITICAL STEP: The needle may be clogged by small pieces of tendon or
undigested muscle during the first few attempts. If clogging occurs during
trituration, remove the clog from the tip of the needle. If clogging occurs
during ejection, pull the plunger up and down to move the clog out of
position. Eject towards the wall of the tube (as opposed to the bottom) to
avoid foaming.

14:25-14:35

14:25-14:35  
  
Fill tube to 50 ml with WM. Gently invert a few times to mix.

  
  
  
Centrifuge at 500 x g for 5 min.    `  
`

14:35-14:40, dropped and re-centrifuged 14:43-14:48

14:35-14:40  
  
Aspirate supernatant down to about 10 mL.

  
  
  
Place a 40-μm Nylon cell strainer on a fresh 50 mL conical tube.

  
  
  
Re-suspend the pellet with a 10 mL pipette. Transfer to the cell strainer and
allow to filter by gravity.

  
  
  
Add 10 mL WM to the original tube. Swirl to rinse, and transfer to the same
cell strainer.

14:55

14:45  
  
Rinse the cell strainer with another 10 mL WM. Use a 20-200 μl pipet to
collect any remaining liquid on the underside of the strainer. CRITICAL STEP:
Make sure to collect everything that remains associated with the outside and
underside of the strainer after filtration to maximize yield.

  
  
  
  

  
  
  
Fill each tube to 50 mL with WM. Gently invert a few times to mix.

  
  
  
  
Transfer 3/4 of the mixture to 1x falcon tube and 1/4 to another tube (1/4 for
immediate culture and the remaining for freezing as homogenate) 15:10  
15:10  
  
  
Centrifuge both tubes at 500 x g for 5 min.        `  
`

15:12

15:12  
  
Remove all supernatant by aspiration immediately after centrifugation as the
pellet will loosen over time! Be very careful not to aspirate cells from the
pellet!

  
  
  
  
  




Culture of the isolate

Note: The homogenate from each biopsy should be split into 4 equal portions. 3
of the portions should be frozen immediately as raw homogenate, while the 4th
potion is placed into immediate culture.  

  1. Place 6mL of DMEM/F12 + 10% FBS + 1x PS (phenol-red containing)media in the water bath at 37C and warm for at least 20min  15:34 pm   

  2. Take the falcon tubes containing 1/4 of the crude homogenate from each biopsy from the centrifuge (see section above) and resuspend in 3mL of pre-warmed growth media per tube. 
  3. Transfer to 1x well of a 6-well plate (use a separate plate for each biopsy) 
  4. Parafilm plates to avoid possible contamination leak into the incubator
  5. Incubate at 37C and 50% CO2, Library Lab incubator 18:26

Freezing isolates  
  
After isolation, Freeze the remaining homogenate portions.  

  1. Aspirate supernatant from each pellet
  2. Resuspend each pellet in 1.5mL Freeze Media (FBS + 10% DMSO)
  3. Aliquot 3 x 500uL aliquots into pre-labelled cryovials.
  4. Transfer vials immediately to a Mr Frosty and into the -80C freezer     :   pm
