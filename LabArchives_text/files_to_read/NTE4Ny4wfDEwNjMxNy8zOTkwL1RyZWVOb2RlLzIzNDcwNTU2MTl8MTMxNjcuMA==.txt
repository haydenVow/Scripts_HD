Background

In order to asses variations in cell viability after freezing and thawing
cells in different freeze medias. 4.5M P3 F_CHOMP09 cells were previously
frozen in either FBS +20% DMSO, Standard Cryostor or DMSO free Cryostor. See

Cryostor is a complete freeze medium which has the advantages of being
chemically defined and animal component free. The additional benefit of DMSO
free Cryostor is obvious in that it does not contain the cytotoxic
cryoprotectant, DMSO. Chemically defined, animal component and DMSO free media
is desirable for the use with cells in terms of QMS tracking. This mini-
experiment was therefore designed to assess if there are any variations in
CHOMP cell viability and proliferative capacity after being preserved in these
freeze medias.
