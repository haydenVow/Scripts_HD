F_DOLLY12 and F_CHOMP cells were passaged into a 4CF each in another
experiment https://au-
mynotebook.labarchives.com/share/Vow%2520-%2520Team%2520Science/NTg5NS41fDEwNjMxNy80NTM1L1RyZWVOb2RlLzc1NTQ2NjE5fDE0OTY1LjU=.
These cells will be fed and maintained for harvest and transport to UTS on
21-Oct-2021.




DOLLY12 Process:

  1. Aliquotted   300 mL of  DMEM/F12 + 10% FBS + 1xP/S 
  2. Placed in 37° C water bath 15:50
  3. Take 3 images per flask at 10x magnification
  4. Removed 50% of supernatant from vessel. 
  5. Replaced with 300mL of Growth media from the 4CF. 
  6. Returned vessel to incubate at: 15:10
    * [X]  Incubator 120, 37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)

CHOMP Process:

  1. Aliquotted  300 mL of  DMEM/F12 + 20% FBS + 1xP/S 
  2. Placed in 30° C incubator 15:50
  3. Take 3 images per flask at 10x magnification 
  4. Removed 50% of supernatant from vessel. 
  5. Replaced with 300mL of Growth media from the 4CF. 
  6. Returned vessel to incubate at: 17:13

  * [X]  Incubator 77, 30ºC, 5% CO2 (crocodile cells)




### Observations/Summary:

 50 % media changed on all vessels  

Limited proliferation and some cell death of CHOMP cells due to 37 degree
incubation. Moved to 30 degrees to promote proliferation.
