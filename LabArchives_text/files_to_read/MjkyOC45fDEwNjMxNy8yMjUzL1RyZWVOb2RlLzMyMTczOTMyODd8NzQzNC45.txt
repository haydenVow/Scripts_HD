Fridge #102 (Biomaterials fridge) wrapped in tin foil.  
Thermo (#13)Fibroblast ECM scaffolds seeded with MuSC  
  
Cell FreeThe media will be pre-aliquoted in a 48-well plate wrapped in foil
labelled as THURS FEED AK EPIC 20128 01 JULY. Place this plate in the
incubator to be pre-warmed. Once warmed transfer the tray and inserts from the
culture vessel into the new plate containing the fresh E6 media. Please
remember to use the old lid which contains all the IDs and scaffold conditions
as the lid for the new plate and please parafilm the plate in the BSC before
returning to the incubator.  
  
  




Process:

1\. Retrieve the pre-aliquoted 48-well plate from the biomaterials fridge
(#102) and place in the incubator for at least 30 minutes to be pre-warmed.
Timestamp: 12:14  \- 13:10 pm  

  1. The plate is wrapped in foil and labelled as THURS FEED AK EPIC 20128 01 JULY

2\. Retrieve the culture plate from incubator.

3\. Using sterile tweezers or hands (sprayed with ethanol), move the tray
containing the well inserts into the new 48WP containing fresh, warm media.

  1. Please use the old lid that contains the culture ID's as the lid for the new plate
  2. Please parafilm the plate containing the inserts and scaffolds in the BSC before returning to the incubator. 

4\. Returned new plate to incubate at:   13:16 pm

### Observations/Summary:

### Observation: When inserts were moved to the plate with fresh media, the
liquid very quickly overflowed and media from all wells started mixing
together (and likely cells too).  
It appears the inserts take up a majority of well volume, so any liquid is
displaced and starts spilling out of the selected wells.

Results:

  * Results were;
    * [ ]  As Usual (this is a repetitive task)
    * [ X]  Unexpected because the media was displaced from the wells and overflowed out of the wells.
    * [ ]  Need to be further analysed
    * [ ]  Other (.......)
