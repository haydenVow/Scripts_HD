1 hour prior to seeding:

-Remove 3x96wp from the biomaterials fridge and place in the BSC  
\- Remove 100% media supernatent from all wells containing media (WG or WZG)
on all 3 plates, LEAVE LIDS AJAR IN BSC UNTIL SEEDING

Cell harvest:

Harvest of cells was documented in the following lab book entry: https://au-
mynotebook.labarchives.com/share/Vow%2520-%2520Team%2520Science/MTA0My45fDEwNjMxNy84MDMvVHJlZU5vZGUvMzM0NDU5Mjc3OXwyNjQ5Ljg5OTk5OTk5OTk5OTY=  
  
NOTE -

Did not attain the expected 36-40M cells from 4x2CFs so to adjust for this we
had to reduce replicates from n=4 to n=3 and seeded at 0.5, 0.7 and 1.3M
cells/scaffold instead of 0.7, 1 and 2M cells/scaffold.

Cell seeding:

Seed 3x 96 well plates with 50ul of cell suspension + respective media (10C
ACF or D/F + 20% FBS + 1X P/S). Leave for 30min then add 200ul of respective
media and place in incubator.  
  
Seed plates using the following plate maps:

Plate 1 - Zein only + cells

Plate 2 - Zein only, cell free controls (add 50ul of respective media only -
10C ACF or D/F 20% FBS + 1X P/S serum media)  

Plate 3 - Black 96wp, Zein/gluten samples (cell-laden and cell-free controls!)
Cannot be lifted from the plate - too fragile.

Seeding of cells:  
  
Plate 1 seeding time: 14:04

Plate 2 seeding time: 14:04

Plate 3 seeding time: 14:04

Addition of 180ul respective media:

Plate 1: 14:31

Plate 2: 14:31

Plate 3: 14:31

Time plates went into the incubator (37'C, 5% CO2):
