Process: CHOMP MMC analysis after 7 days  

  * Media was removed from roller bottles and collected. 3x 10ml samples collected in 15ml falcon tubes for collagen (media) assay
  * Roller bottles were fixed in 10ml 4% PFA for 20m, then this was removed and washed with 2x 50ml PBS
  *  25ml 1ml/ml sirius red was added to each bottle and coated with rotation for 40m
  * meanwhile 4ml siius red was added to media samples and incubated at RT for 30m
  * unbound/excess dye in roller bottles was removed and washed 3x 25ml PBS, then inverted and left to dry
  * media samples were centrifuged at 4000G for 10m, then supernatant discarded.
  * media samples were washed in 10ml PBS for 20m, the recentrifuged, supernatant discarded and left to dry inverted
  * 10ml 1M NAOH was added to the roller bottles and 1ml NaOH to each media sample. The pellets/stain was left to destain overnight (roller bottles replaced on the roller)
  * 200ul of each condition was pipetted into a 96 well plate and collagen quantified in the plate reader at ABS540nm
  *   




Observations/Summary: FICOLL groups have a more confluent cell layer than
control.  

Due to unlevel surface for the second set of experiments (right, cell pellets
were inadvertently formed), therefore these data are less reliable. The
process for running the experiments and analysis via collagen quantification
is shown to be robust. Cell sheets were visible in the roller bottles, and not
fully confluent, so more than 100M cell/bottle can be used
