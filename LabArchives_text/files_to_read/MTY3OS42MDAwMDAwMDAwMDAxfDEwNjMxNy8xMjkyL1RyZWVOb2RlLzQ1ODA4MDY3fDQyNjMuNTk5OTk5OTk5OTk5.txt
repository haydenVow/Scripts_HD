Process:

1\. Aliquotted   3 mL  mL of  E6 Media, 1mM, 3mM, 5mM, 7mM, 9mM creatine + E6
media into  15 mL     tube(s). Aliquots of media too small to stay stable in
water bath, hence placed incubator at    07:14 am

2\. Removed  100  % of supernatant from vessel.

3\. Replaced with  0.5 mL (per well/per vessel) of  respective media   media.

4\. Returned vessel to incubate at 07:58am :

  * [x]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (aviary cells)

  

  * Incubator (#THERMO  ), Lab [Main]
