6719-DOLLY12_11E7-Sheep P11-1of1 (E250)  

Process:

  1. Removed cultures from incubator 11:11 
  2. Sampled 20uL of culture microcarrier suspension into a blank well in a non tissue culture treated 96 well plate. Ensured that sample was taken after swirling on the flat surface of the BSC, while liquid was still in motion.
  3. Transferred cultures back into incubator #68 shaking at 110 RPM. 11:19
  4. Added 80uL of dPBS to the well to make up a total volume of 100uL in the well.
  5. Added 2uL of Hoescht stain to well and mixed gently with a P200 pipette, mixing the microcarriers to create an even and spread monolayer but ensuring no bubbles were formed in the process.
  6. Incubated plate in the dark at RT for 15 mins. 11:30 - 12:00
  7. Imaged Phase and DAPI channels at 5x on the Axio microscope in main lab.

Observations/Summary:

Images seem to be really bright, not clear on how to fix on Axio microscope -
to follow up with Nathan and Tom.

Results:

  * Results were;
    * [ ]  As Usual (this is a repetitive task)
    * [X]  Unexpected because images were too bright
    * [ ]  Need to be further analysed
    * [ ]  Other (.......)
