## Reagent Prep

Live staining with CMFDA: SEE GUIDE ON CMFDA STAINING HERE  

Preparation of stock and and working solutions for CMFDA Cell Tracker

1\. Remove the CMFDA powder from the freezer (main lab) and allow it to warm
to room temperature. Each aliquot is 50 ug.

  1.  Briefly centrifuge the tube to pellet the CMFDA powder

2\. Add 50 uL high-quality, anhydrous DMSO to the powder and pipette up and
down until well suspended. This will yield a 1 mM CFDA stock solution.

  1. NOTE - Once prepared, the DMSO stock solution should be stored at -20'C in a 70 mL pot submerged in silica-gel desiccant beads for a short period for one series of experiments. If a large amount of stock solution is left, then any remaining solution should be aliquoted and frozen at < \- 20Â°C. Avoid repeated freeze-thaw cycles, and protect from light. 




## Sample Selection

  1. Using sterile tweezers or acupuncture needles, select 1 "meatball" from each cup or
    1. slice off part of samples if only bigger constructs are found, sterile spatula works well for this
  2. transfer into a new well on a 96w or 24w plate prefilled with warm PBS (to remove media and serum if any)
  3. Proceed with CMFDA protocol as below




## CMFDA protocol

  1. Aliquot    1     mL PBS for washing the samples and place in waterbath   12:45  . (This is only necessary for samples containing serum as serum interferes with the CMFDA stain)
  2. Transfer    8    uL of the 1mM CMFDA stock solution to    4     mL of prepared PBS in a light safe falcon tube to protect it from light. 
  3. Vortex to ensure thorough mixing with the resulting solution being approximately 2 uM CMFDA working solution. (2uL of 1mM CMFDA stock solution: 1mL of D/F media.)
  4. Place in the water bath to be pre-warmed   12:45am    

  5. Aspirate the rinsing media 
  6. Add    1     mL of pre-warmed CMFDA working solution to the samples and incubate for 30 minutes at 37'C covered in foil to protect samples from light.
    1. Start/Finish time was:      13:30  pm   

    2. If the CMFDA working solution is no longer required dispose of solution as aqueous waste as aqueous solutions of CMFDA are susceptible to hydrolysis and should be used within one day.
  7. Remove    1000     uL of staining solution from each well and replace with PBS
  8. Image all wells from plates on the Zaber fluorescence microscope or AXIO (channel AF488 for CMFDA [Live cells]). Remember to image both sides or use z-stacking (200 uM slices for 3mm meatballs)




### Observations/Summary:

some cells dead in 1% gel, but most alive and mostly round

in some cases radial adhesion (or cell death and shedding of cytoplasm) could
be observed but not imaged

  

Victoria suspects structures resemble blebbing and recommends adding further
binding sites push cells to full adhesion.

Blebs are protrusions of the cell membrane. They are the result of actomyosin
contractions of the cortex, which cause either transient detachment of the
cell membrane from the actin cortex or a rupture in the actin cortex. Then,
cytosol streams out of the cell body and inflates the newly formed bleb.
