Process
  
  
  1. Made up 1L of 50/50 RPMI/CHO Nuvonis suspension medium without IGF & EGF (base medium) 
  2. Added respective volume of MilliQ water to each powder and stirred on stir plate until fully dissolved. 
    1. Sodium pyruvate (11g/L or 100mM): 1.1g in 100mL or 0.22g in 20 mL
      1. Actual mass measured: 0.2213g  
*Note: This provides 8.803 g/L of pyruvate
    2. L-Alanyl-L-Glutamine (43.4g/L): 4.34g in 100 mL 
      1. Actual mass measured: 4.3436
  3. Ala-Gln is acidic, so adjusted pH from 6 to 7.1 using 1.1+mL of 1M NaOH 
  4. Transferred specimen jars to BSC
  5. Sterile filtered each stock solution using 50 mL syringe filters 
  6. Added glucose, L-glutamine, L-Alanyl-L-Glutamine, hypoxanthine and thymidine to 300 mL of media (Flasks 1-9) as shown in calculated table attached below   
  
  
  

  7. Added glucose, L-glutamine and L-alanyl-glutamine to 120 mL of media (no hypoxanthine or thymidine) (Flasks 10-12 + resuspension media) as shown in calculated table attached below  
  
  

  8. Added glucose, L-glutamine, L-alanyl-L-glutamine, hypoxanthine, thymidine and pyruvate to 100 mL of media (Flasks 13-15) as shown in calculated table attached below  
  
  

  9. Added IGF and EGF to the three aliquots 
  10. Placed in fridge at 4'C overnight 


Notes


Amount of pyruvate in 50/50 RPMI/CHO + Nuvonis was determined based on the NMR
data for RPMI + Nuvonis and CHO + Nuvonis (0.5*average(pyruvate contained in
RPMI) + 0.5*average(pyruvate contained in CHO)). We used this data instead of
the NMR data obtained for the 50/50 RPMI/CHO + Nuvonis + GFs + 2g/L glucose +
0.435g/L L-glutamine sample because we thought it would be more accurate given
we had analysed several replicates of RPMI + Nuvonis and CHO + Nuvonis and
only one replicate of 50/50 RPMI/CHO + Nuvonis + GFs + 2g/L glucose + 0.435g/L
L-glutamine. The values are not too different (0.03171554283 g/L vs.
0.02844338 g/L)  however, I have made up two different tables on the E8
calculator in case we want to add pyruvate to our medium based on the actual
amount of pyruvate (0.02844338 g/L) obtained from the NMR analysis of 50/50
RPMI/CHO + Nuvonis + GFs + 2g/L glucose + 0.435g/L L-glutamine.
