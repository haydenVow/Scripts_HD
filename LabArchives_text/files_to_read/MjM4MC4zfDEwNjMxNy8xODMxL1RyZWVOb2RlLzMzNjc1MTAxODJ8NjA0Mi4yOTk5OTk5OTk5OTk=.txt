Process:

1\. These cells were passaged yesterday and seeded in 500uL of media per well.
Conditions 4, 5 and 6 (ID 7101, 7102, 7103) need 800ug/mL of albumin added to
them. So, add 2uL of albumin (stock 1803) to each of these wells. Use a
separate tip for each well.

2\. Returned vessel to incubate at:

  * [X]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (aviary cells)

  

  * [X]  Thermo Incubator (ID #13)
  * [ ]  Top Sanyo Incubator (ID #25)
  * [ ]  Bottom Sanyo Incubator
  * [ ]  Top Binder Incubator
  * [ ]  Bottom Binder Incubator
