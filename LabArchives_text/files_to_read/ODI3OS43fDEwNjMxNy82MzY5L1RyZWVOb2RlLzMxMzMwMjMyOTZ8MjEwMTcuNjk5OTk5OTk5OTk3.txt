White fungal contamination was identified in the 6 well plates, These plates
were bleached and discarded.  
White fungal contamination was also identified in the bioreactor tube cultures
10269, 10270 and 10271. An aliquot of 10270 was placed into a well on a 96
well plate and fungal contamination was evident when observing the culture
down the 10x objective. These cultures were bleached and then discarded.

All 384 well plate cultures were then discarded. While contamination was not
apparent in wells on these plates, cultures in the same incubator appeared
contaminated. It was deemed to high a risk to continue these cultures as they
posed a potential recontamination risk if not discarded.
