### Process:

1\. Took image of vessel with microscope on phase setting.

2\. Gelatin coated     5     x    T175      vessels with sterile filtered 0.1%
gelatin solution and then incubated all coated flasks at 37˚C.

  1. Time when all vessels(s) placed into the incubator       14:55   a/pm 

3\. Aliquotted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then
placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath for a minimum of 20 minutes
prior to use:

  1. TrypLE:     30    mL in     1x50mL    tubes
  2.  dPBS (for washing and neutralising):     30    mL in    1x50mL    tubes
  3. Growth media (for pellet resuspension):    90     mL in    1x120mL     container
  4. Growth media (for seeding):     5    mL in      1x15   tubes

Time that all aliquots were placed in the water bath the warm before use
14:30 (growth media)   a/pm    14:59 (all other reagents)   a/pm

Note: if aliquots were placed in water bath at different time, record the time
stamp for each individual solution.




4\. Removed vessel(s) from the incubator     15:05   a/pm , Imaged one flask
under the primovert microscope, 4x objective to track confluence before
passage. Cells appeared about 65-70% confluent.

5\. Washed the vessel(s) with dPBS (warmed).

6\. Added     15    mL tryple to each vessel/well and incubated at 37˚C.

  1. Start/Finish for TrypLE was     15:10 - 15:25   a/pm 

7\.  Gelatin coated 6 wells on 3x96 well plates (B2-B4, C2-C4) using 0.1%
sterile filtered gelatin (0.1um filtered). Placed the plates in the incubator
at 15:19.  

8.Neutralised with     10     dPBS and combined cell suspension into    2x50mL
tubes (30mL each).

9\. Centrifuged at 650 x g for 5 min.

  1. Start/Finish time for centrifugation was     15:34-15:39   a/pm 




9\. Aspirated the supernatant(s).

10\. Resuspended pellet(s) in     1    mL    growth      media     15:45
a/pm

Combined pellet resuspensions into 1 50mL tube, washed out the empty tube
using 500uL of extra growth media, this was then pooled with the total volume
bringing the volume of cell resuspension to 2.5mL.

11\. Aliquoted     10uL     of resuspended cells into a microcentrifuge tube
for cell count.

12\. Performed a cell count using the haemocytometer and recorded the cell
count data in the Google Doc spreadsheet called 'Cell Count Spreadsheet' (see
link below):

SSIBtIylyrBQE5kRX5Z8NtI/edit#gid=0&range=1066:1066

  1.  Total cell number was:      3,480,000         




Seeding SUSPENSION (E125 flask) (3/4 of counted cell suspension).

  1.  ~~Transferred       1.875    mL of cell suspension (2610000cells total) to the pre-warmed E125 flask containing     30     mL  growth media and ~135mg of Cytodex 1 microcarriers ( 4394 cells/cm^2):      :    a/pm ~~
  2.  ~~Transferred vessel(s) to incubate at:  ~~

  *  ~~[x]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells), incubator 68.~~
  *  ~~[ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (avian cells)~~ ~~~~




Seeding DIFF cultures (3x96wp)

  1. Transferred       71    µl of cell suspension (100,000 cells) to the pre-warmed      4     mL Growth media:      :    a/pm 
  2. Transferred cell suspension into the pre-gelatin coated       6 wells across 3x96 well plates, B2-B4 + C2-C4       

  3. Transferred vessel(s) to incubate at: 16:45 

  * [x]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells), incubaotr #67. 
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (avian cells)




Seeding PLANAR + SUSPENSION cultures (T175 flasks)  

  1. Aliquoted out an additional 60mL of growth media into a 250mL container, combined this with the 90mL of pre warmed growth media to make 150mL of growth media.  
  2. Transferred 0.875mL of cell suspension into the 150mL of growth media. (1218000 cells, 8120 cells/mL). 
  3. Realised this was too much cell suspension to aliquot across 5xT175 flasks.   

  4. Removed the E125 flask containing 30mL of equilibrated carriers from the incubator.   

  5. Waited 4 minutes for the microcarriers to settle, then aspirated and discarded the supernatant.   

  6. Aliquoted 55mL of the growth media suspension from Step 2 above into the E125 (447999 cells), cells remaining in the 95mL of cell suspension = 770000 cells.   

  7. Added 55mL of additonal growth media back to the 250mL container to bring the volume back up to 150mL and cell concentration to 5133cells/mL.   

  8. Aliuqoted the 150mL of cell suspension across 5 gelatin coated T175 flasks, 30mL per flask (153999 cells/flask).  

  9. Left at RT in the BSC for 30 min to allow cells to settle      16:45  \-  17:15 a/pm  
  10. Added the remaining cells from the counted cell suspension to the E125 flask. Cell total in E flask =   ~~~~2610000 ~~~~cells  

  11. Tansferred vessel(s) to incubate and shake at 110rpm continuously to seed microcarriers. [16:45], incubator #68.   

  12. Removed the E125 from the incubator [16:55], decided to transfer the total flask volume to an E250. This was to ensure the carriers could be easily suspended at a shake speed at 110 given that the shaker was being shared with an additional E250 and E500 flask from a separate experiment. (EPIC16072).
  13. Transferred the T175 flasks to incubator #67.
