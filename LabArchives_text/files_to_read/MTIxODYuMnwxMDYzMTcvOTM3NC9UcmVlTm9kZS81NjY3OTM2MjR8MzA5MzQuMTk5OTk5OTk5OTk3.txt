Concisely state the key results without your interpretations behind it.  
  
For example: 'molecule x increased glucose uptake of myoblasts', rather than
'molecule x increased glucose uptake of myoblasts indicating that glucose
uptake is controlled by pathway y'.  
  
Results should be directly relevant to the aims of the experiment.  
  
* Refers to what statistical analysis was performed (e.g. T-test, ANOVA) see guidance page on statistics for help  
** and *** See the following writeup on communicating your data to calculate
variance (sdtdev = standard deviation) and effect size  
  

Why? This format allows the reader to quickly to see and digest the results
and their significance in an impartial way. Interpretations to the results
will be added in the Report/discussion.

  
  


Figures


Add all figures (graphs, tables, images) into this section with respective
captions (captions are written below figures for graphs and above for tables).

The figure caption should include the following information: What data is
being shown and what time point it relates to, how many replicates were used
n=?, abbreviation meanings, significance threshold e.g. P ≤ 0.05 (if
relevant), what the error bars represent e.g. std dev, microscope
magnifications, wavelengths measured at, and dyes used (if relevant), you can
also put the statistical tests employed here. See example caption here.

For graphs include axis titles with units of measurement, a key, and error
bars (stdev).  
  
Where any conditions significantly different from each other? One way to make
this quickly apparent on a graph is the use of asterisks and significance
lines. Wherein if 0 was significantly higher than 300 there would be lines
linking the two with asterisks above, number of asterisks denote the
significance threshold i.e.  
P ≤ 0.05 *  
 P ≤ 0.01 **  
P ≤ 0.001 ***  

The following youtube video shows you how to do this.

Why? Visual aids present data more clearly, detailed captions are necessary to
fully understand what is being shown.
