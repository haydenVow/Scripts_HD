Process:

1\. Aliquotted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then
placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath for a minimum of 20 minutes
prior to use:

  1. TrypLE:    10   mL in   1x 15 mL   tubes 09:51
  2. dPBS (for neutralising)    20   mL in    1x 50 mL   tubes 09:51
  3. Growth media (for pellet resuspension):    3   mL in    1x 15 mL   tubes 10:00
  4. Times that all aliquots were placed in the water bath to warm before use 

Note: if aliquots were placed in water bath at different times, record the
time stamp for each individual solution.




2\. Washed the flask(s) with dPBS.

3\. Added    10   mL tryple to each vessel/well and incubated at 37˚C for
20    min.

Note: Fibroblasts typically require 15-18 minutes of incubation with tryple,
slightly longer than MuSCs.

  1. Start/Finish time for centrifugation was    10:05    \-    10:25   a/pm

4\. Neutralised with    10 mL   dPBS (warmed) and combined cell suspension
into a    2x 15 mL   tubes.

5\. Centrifuged at 650 x g for 5 min

  1. Start/Finish time for centrifugation was    10:28    \-    10:33  a/pm 




6\. Aspirated the supernatant(s)

7\. Resuspended pellet(s) in      3  mL    Growth   media.

8\. Performed a cell count using the haemocytometer and recorded the cell
count data in the Google Doc spreadsheet called 'Cell Count Spreadsheet' (see
link below):

SSIBtIylyrBQE5kRX5Z8NtI/edit#gid=0

9\. Total cell number was:  6.75 M cells  (510,000 cells per scaffold)

10\. Divided cell suspension into 2 x tubes of 1.5mL each and centriduged
10:57 - 11:02 am  




  1. Moved tubes to Main lab where growth media is warming up and zein scaffolds drying out.
  2. Aspirate supernatant from each pellet.
  3. Resuspend 1 pellet in 250uL of Growth Media + 50ug/mL LAA2P - ASSESS WHETHER THERE IS A TOTAL VOLUME OF 300uL. (assuming volume of cells = ~50uL)  
Note* not enough. Added the additional 50uL and it was easily 300uL total.

  4. Resuspend 1 pellet in 300uL of Growth Media (no LAA2P)
  5. Seed 50uL/well of cell suspension into each scaffold in wells C3-C8 ( no LAA2P) `11:20 - 11:24 am`
  6. Seed 50uL/well of cell suspension into each scaffold in wells D3-D8 ( + 50ug/mL LAA2P) `11:24 - 11:26 am`
  7. Set timer for 30 min.  `11:25 - 11:55 am`
  8. Add 50uL/well of Growth Media (no LAA2P) to scaffolds in wells E3-E8 & C9-F9 `11:27 - 11:28 am`
  9. Add 50uL/well of Growth Media (+ 50ug/mL LAA2P) to scaffolds in wells F3-F8 `11:28 - 11:30 am`

  

  

14\. Transfer flask/plate(s) to incubate at:

  * [X ]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
