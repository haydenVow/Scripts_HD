### Process:

1\. Took image of vessel with microscope on phase setting.

1\. Aliquotted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then
placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath for a minimum of 20 minutes
prior to use:

  1. TrypLE:   13   mL
  2.  dPBS (for washing & neutralising):    27   mL 
  3. Growth media (for pellet resuspension):   4  mL 
  4. Growth media (for seeding):   11   mL 

Time that all aliquots were placed in the water bath the warm before use
11:41  

Note: if aliquots were placed in water bath at different time, record the time
stamp for each individual solution.




3\. Removed vessel(s) from the incubator  

4\. Washed the vessel(s) with dPBS (warmed).

5\. Added    1,20.5 & 0.2  mL tryple/well and incubated at 37˚C.

  1. Start/Finish for TrypLE was    11:55 - 12:06   

6\. Neutralised with    2, 1 & 0.5 mL    dPBS/vessel and combined cell
suspensions into   8 x 15 mL  tubes.

7\. Centrifuged at 650 x g for 5 min.

  1. Start/Finish time for centrifugation was    12:19 - 12:24  




9\. Aspirated the supernatant(s).

10\. Resuspended pellet(s) in    0.2  mL    growth    medium

11\. Aliquoted    10 uL  of resuspended cells into a microcentrifuge tube for
cell count.

12\. Performed a cell count using the haemocytometer and recorded the cell
count data in the Google Doc spreadsheet: Cell Count Spreadsheet or cell count
widget below

12\. Transferred   200   µL of cell suspensions (from C1-C4 & CTRL2-CTRL3) to
the pre-warmed  11  mL Growth medium.

13\. Transferred cell suspension into the  1 x T75   vessel

14\. Transferred vessel(s) to incubate at:   13:12  

  * [ ]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (avian cells)
  * [x]  30ºC, 5% CO2 (reptilian cells)

Observations/Summary:

All cells passaged and counted in their separate conditions. Conditions 1-4
and controls 1 & 2 combined after cell count into 1 x T75 for expansion.
