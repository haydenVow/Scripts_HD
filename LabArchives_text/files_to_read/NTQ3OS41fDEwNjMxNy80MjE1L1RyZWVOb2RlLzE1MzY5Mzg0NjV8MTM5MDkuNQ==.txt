Agarose-Coated Flask

  1. Discaded flask as agarose coating has lifted almost entirely off the base of the flask. 

Poloxamer flask

  1. Discarded flask as cells have all stuck down - poloxamer did not sufficiently prevent cells from adhering

  




Images & Observations

Agarose-coated flask

Phase, 10X, cells have formed visible clumps in medium. Agarose appears to be
successful at preventing cells from adhering to the flask surface.  

  

 On day 3, the agarose gel had started lifting from base of flask and was seen
floating around in medium

  

 Medium with poloxamer added

Phase, 10X, cells have adhered to base of flask despite added poloxamer.
Either poloxamer is ineffective at preventing adhesion, or a higher
concentration is required.
