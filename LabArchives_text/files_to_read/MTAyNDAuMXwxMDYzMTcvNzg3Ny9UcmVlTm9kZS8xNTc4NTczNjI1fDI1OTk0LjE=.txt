MICRO Carrier Preparation Protocol
  
  
Materials and Equipment Required

  1. Microcarriers
  2. Siliconized Schott Bottles
  3. Cell culture medium
  4. Sterile PBS (without Ca and Mg)
  5. TrypLE-EDTA
  6. Pluronic F-127

General Protocol

Microcarrier Hydration

  1. Weigh out 0.2 g of microcarrier into a siliconized schott bottle.
  2. Add 100mL PBS to achieve a final concentration of 2g/L.
  3. Autoclave at 121°C for 20 minutes to hydrate microcarriers.
  4. Cool down to room temperature before use. 

Culture Medium (with Pluronic F127) Preparation

  1. In a sterile container, mix Pluronic F127 with growth medium to a final concentration of 5% (w/v).
  2. Stir on a low spin speed using a autoclaved magnetic stir bar at room temperature until the Pluronic F127 had dissolved.
  3. Sterile filter the pluronic solution into a sterile container inside the BSC using a syringe with a 0.2 micron filter.

Culture Medium Equilibration

  1. Pipette microcarrier solution up and down to create a homogenous solution.
  2. Pipette required aliquot into a centrifuge safe tube and centrifuge for 5 mins at 300g.
  3. Remove PBS supernatant and replace with cell culture medium. Pipetting up and down to wash microcarriers.
  4. Place on rocker stage and rock to stir microcarrier solution for 10 mins.
  5. Centrifuge at 300g for 3 mins, remove supernatant and resuspend microcarriers to required concentration in filtered 5% w/v Pluronic F127 in growth media .

Cell Seeding

  1. Pipette microcarrier solution up and down to create a homogenous solution, pipette required amount of microcarriers plus media into a 50 mL polypropylene centrifuge tube. Bring to incuabtion temperature.
  2. Trypsinise and harvest cells from culture vessels and seed (AT HIGHER DENSITY THAN NORMAL - To account for cell loss due to lack of attachment to a microcarrier) microcarrier solution at the appropriate density directly into 50 mL centrifuge tube.
  3. Incubate for 3 hours with gentle agitation every half hour. 
  4. Pipette seeded microcarriers into an ultra low attachment plate at required concentration (ideally enough to coat surface of plate).
  5. Incubate and culture until confluence is reached.

Workflow - Media Equilibration of Carriers


1\. Make a 5% w/v Pluronic F-127 DMEM/F12 20%FBS solution

Amount of F-127 (ID: 821) = 15.001g

DMEM/F12 20%FBS (ID: 12301) = 300mL

Add to media warmed to 40C and use magnetic stirrer on lowest speed to mix.
This will take about 1hr or more. If the pluronic F127 forms a large clump,
use a spatula to break up clumps into smaller clumps. On the low speed, the
clumps will move to the middle and fall down hitting the stirrer bar and
breaking up.

2\. Filter media + pluronic F127 through 0.22 micron filter unit.

3\. Concentrate microcarrier solutions in media

\- Gelatex = Take 171.5 mL of solution, remove PBS and add to 21.44 mL
media+F127 to make a 16g/mL concentration

\- BioCradle L = Take 79 mL of solution, remove PBS and add to 9.88 mL
media+F127 to make a 16 g/mL concentration

\- Count out required amount of macro carriers and add to media (Bionoc = 18,
fibracell = 54).
