  
  
Passaged the 10% serum adapted CHOMP cells into new vessels today.  
  
Cells were passaged as normal out of 1x2CF flasks (ID 13118)

  1. Cells were washed with sterile filtered dPBS (100mL) a13297.
  2. Wash was removed and cells were covered with 100mL of sterile filtered tryple-EDTA m13300
  3. Cells were incubated at 30 degrees at 5% CO2 for 14 minutes. Agitated for at the 10 minute mark by hand. 
  4. Cells were collected into 50mL tubes and flask was washed down with equal volumes of dPBS to tryple (100mL) 
  5. Washes were also collected to the same tubes 
  6. Cells were centrifuged at 650g for 5 minutes to pellet 
  7. Supernatant was discarded and cells were resuspended and pooled in 40mL of growth media (DMEM/F12 + 10% FBS + 1xP/S, m13355)
  8. 10uL of cells were taken in triplicate for a trypan blue stain at a 1:2 dilution followed by a count under a hemocytometer. https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1DPzKubYxfHmWogVPihC-SSIBtIylyrBQE5kRX5Z8NtI/edit#gid=0&range=2652:2655  

Cells Counts. 17,280,000, 19,040,000, 14,560,000  
Count average = 16,960,000 cells in 40mL (13,417 cells/cm^2)

All of the 10% CHOMP cells were  then used to seed a 4CF in 600mL of 10% FBS
growth media.

New culture ID (13150). Cells were placed in incubator 68 at 30 degrees, 5%
CO2.
