### Process:

1\. Took image of vessel with microscope on phase setting.

3\. Aliquotted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then
placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath for a minimum of 20 minutes
prior to use:

  1. TrypLE:     40    mL in     1    tubes
  2.  dPBS (for neutralising):    40     mL
  3.  dPBS (for washing):     40    mL
  4. Growth media (for pellet resuspension):     10    mL
  5. Growth media (for seeding):    5     mL 

Time that all aliquots were placed in the water bath the warm before use
14:55  

Note: if aliquots were placed in water bath at different time, record the time
stamp for each individual solution.




4\. Removed vessel(s) from the incubator   15:06  

5\. Washed the vessel(s) with dPBS (warmed).

6\. Added     10    mL tryple to each vessel/well and incubated at 37˚C.

  1. Start/Finish for TrypLE was    15:12 - 15:28  Checked at 11 min, needed longer (~70% detached)  

7\. Neutralised with     10 mL per flask     dPBS and combined cell suspension
into a     2 x 50 mL    tubes.

8\. Centrifuged at 650 x g for 5 min.

  1. Start/Finish time for centrifugation was    15:34 - 15:39  




Total cell count:         7,860,000  

  * Volume of cell suspension required for subculture was:     110 uL       

  * Cell density per vessel:   7,000 cells/cm2    




13\. Transferred    110   µl of cell suspension to the pre-warmed      5  mL
Growth media:     16:09  

14\. Transferred cell suspension into the      T25      vessel.

16\. Transferred vessel(s) to incubate at:

  * [ x]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (avian cells)




  

11\. Aiming to freeze 1 million cells/cryovial in 1mL freeze media per vial,
Prepared   10 mL Freeze Medium: (FBS + 10% DMSO).

Note: Final density was 1,097,857 cells per vial

Stored at 4ºC until use to keep chilled. 16:05

12\. Centrifuged cells at 650 x g for 5 min.   16:11 -  16:16

Whilst centrifuge is spinning, prepared & printed vial labels, labelled
cryovials. (Note that passage number will be the same as the culture you
harvest from. The passage number will increase by 1 during the revive of a
vial.)

13\. Aspirated supernatant carefully, taking care not to disturb the pellet.

14\. Resuspended the pellet in | 7 |mL freeze media (chilled, to reduce DMSO
toxicity).

15\. Aliquotted | 1000 |µL into | 7 | x cryovials (already labelled).

16\. Tightened the lids & transfer the cryovials to a Mr. Frosty immediately
into the -80ºC freezer. Labelled "DOLLY12 1A16 Fibros 20.8.21", in second
shelf from top in library lab -80 freezer   16:26 pm

  * [ ]  With foam
  * [ ]  Without foam
  * [ ]  1st Freeze
  * [ ]  2nd Freeze
  * [ ]  3rd Freeze
  * [x]  4th Freeze
  * [ ]  5th Freeze

17\. Allow the cells to freeze for at least 18-24 hours before transferring to
Liquid Nitrogen storage.




Observations/Summary:

Clone F_DOLLY12_1A16 frozen down into X x 1M cell vials + also 1 x T25 flask
maintained in culture seeded at 7,000 cells / cm2.
