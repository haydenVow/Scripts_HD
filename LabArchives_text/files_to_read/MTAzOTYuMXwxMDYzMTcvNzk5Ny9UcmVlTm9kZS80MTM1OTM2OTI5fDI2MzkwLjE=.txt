Process
  
  
  1. Removed flasks from incubator 
  2. Took 2 x 550 uL samples from each E-flask
  3. Performed cell counts and averaged for each flask and each condition (recorded in table below)
  4. Aliquoted following volumes of media with growth factors and warmed in water bath to reduce density. Checked table below to see if any cultures require expansion into larger E-flask. 
    1. 90/10: 400 mL + IGF + EGF (topping culutre up to 1400 mL to be split across 2 x E2000s)
    2. 100/0: 30 mL + IGF + EGF (100% feed - still seems to be in adapting phase - keep in E125)
  5. Transferred 100/0 culture to 1 x 50 mL flask
  6. Centrifuged at 500 x g for 5 min
  7. Aspirated 100% of supernatant and resuspended in 30 mL warmed media
  8. Strained culture through 40 um cell strainer into new E-flask
  9. Divided 400 mL of 90/10 media across 2 x empty E2000s
  10. Strained each 90/10 culture through 40 um cell strainer into new E2000 flasks (700 mL per flask)
  11. Returned cultures to incubate at 37'C, 5% CO2, 110 RPM

Very clumpy, little less healthy looking. Suspect it is the 3 days instead of
2 days between feeds (weekend)

Look okay, membranes a little less defined than I'd like and cells are a bit
granular. However, they are growing and I'm seeing doublets, and it's still
clear that they are cells
