Aim


To encourage muscle cells to produce carnosine by supplementing media with
B-alanine.


Introduction


Carnosine is an abundant histidine-containing dipeptide in human skeletal
muscle and formed by beta-alanine and L-histidine. It has long been known that
carnosine helps reduce damaging protein glycation in the body, as well as
having other potentially  beneficial effects. For example, carnosine has
excellent antioxidant properties. It can greatly reduce damage from the highly
reactive oxygen free radicals that are produced from the out-of-control
oxidation of lipids and sugar that can occur in Metabolic Syndromes and
diabetes.  
  
Synthesis of carnosine appears to be limited by the availability of beta-
alanine, which itself is synthesised within the body or obtained from the diet
(Perim et al.,). The main dietary sources of beta-alanine are meat and fish
containing carnosine and its methylated derivatives. Daily ingestion of
carnosine and related peptides in current human diets ranges from <50 to
>4000mg for those consuming vegetarian and very high meat-content diets [1].
Chronic oral supplementation of beta-alanine has been shown to increase
skeletal muscle carnosine content by up to 200% (16).  
  
  


Hypothesis


B-alanine supplementation will promote the production of carnosine in BUFFY
cells.


Protocol and timeline


Overview:

  * B-alanine will be added to differentiation media across (4 concentrations see below) with the absence of B-alanine supplementation as a negative control.
  * Both E6 and DMEM/F12 + 2% HS + 1X P/S will be assessed (2% HS media as a form of positive control and to keep consistent with literature).
  * Cultures will be expanded till confluent, then switched to respective conditioned media
  * Conditions will be differentiated for 6 days then harvested on the 7th day.
  * Cells will be assessed for carnosine content via colorimetiric assay (see next experimental plan)
