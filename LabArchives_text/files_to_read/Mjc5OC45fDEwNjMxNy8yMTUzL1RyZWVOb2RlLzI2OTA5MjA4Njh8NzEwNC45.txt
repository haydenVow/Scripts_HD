Media/Reagents used:

NameDetails  
  
Growth Media incl 1:100 ACA  
M 5609  
  
Growth Media incl 1:100 ACA (low serum 5% FBS)  
M 5610  
  
Growth Media incl 1:100 ACA + RGD Peptide  
M 5612  
  
Growth Media incl 1:100 ACA + YIGSR Peptide

Process:

1\. Place the pre-aliquotted  10 mL  mL of each respective type of Growth
Media into the water bath   13:55

2\. Placed shake tubes in centrifuge and centrifuge at 650 x g for 5 min at
RT.   14:00

Aspirated supernatant from each pellet

Added 1mL of respective growth media to each tube and used a P1000 pipette to
break up cell clumps.

Remaining 9mL of each respective media was added afterwards and triturated
with 10mL serological pipette to break up cell clumps for each culture further
and resuspend cells evenly.

10uL of each culture taken for viability check

4\. Returned vessel to incubate at:   14:30

  * [X ]  37ÂºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * Incubator (#67 ), Lab [Library]
