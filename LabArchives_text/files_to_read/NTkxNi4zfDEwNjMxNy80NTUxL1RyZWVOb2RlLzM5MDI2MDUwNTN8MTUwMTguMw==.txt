## Performed by: LL  




Note: This flask was due to be fed tomorrow (12-Oct-2021), however the feed is
being performed today. This is because it was realised today at ~16:00 that
the incubator housing this culture has accidentally been turned off since 6 pm
on Friday (8-Oct-2021). We decided to perform a 100% feed, as it was likely
that there would be a number of senescing cells releasing signals for
surviving cells to also begin dying.

Process:

  1. Aliquoted 30 mL of growth medium in 1 x 50 mL tube
  2. Added growth factors to aliquot as listed in table above (see Mix IDs for growth factors in table above to ensure you are adding the correct ones) 
    *  Placed aliquot in water bath 17:00
  3. Collected E125 from shaker, wiped with ethanol-sprayed Rediwipe, and brought into BSC :
  4. Pipette suspension into 1 x 50 mL tubes. Kept E125 vessels in BSC, as culture will be returned to this vessel after feed. 
  5. Centrifuged at 300 x g for 5 min.  17:10 - 17:15   

  6. Aspirated  100% (30 mL) of supernatant, taking extra care to not disrupt or aspirate pellet. 
  7. Resuspended pellet in 500 uL of medium
  8. Took 1 x 10 uL sample for haemocytometer cell count.  
Cell count: 508,800

  9. Recorded count here https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-Z9HKM0xSq8-UX2C4876emMP7FCWLcpSqxwLkI-zypg/edit#gid=0
  10. Added   30 mL of fresh, warmed growth media to 50 mL tube
  11. Gently pipette-mixed cultures using serelogical, before moving cell suspension back to E125
  12. Returned E125 to incubator.   17:26

### Observations/Summary:

 100  % media changed on vessel(s)

  1. 7694-F_DOLLY12-Sheep P11-1of1  
  
Expected that all or most cells would be dead with lots of debris due to mass
cell death from being at ambient conditions for >48H. However, cells appear to
be healthy and mostly unchanged morphologically since last feed (see mia image
link). Cell numbers do appear to have dropped significantly.
