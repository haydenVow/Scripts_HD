### Process:

1\. Inspected wells under the microscope, 5x objective to observe which clones
were 100% confluent. No wells were 100% confluent, many appeared to have a
morphology that was egg like or flat with spike like boarders




FEEDING:

1\. Clones that were not passaged received a 100% media feed (1.5mL of media),
Media was aspirated and discarded from each well and replaced with fresh,
warmed growth media. Plates were then returned back to the incubator at 30
degrees, 5% CO2. Incubator 82 in main lab.




Observations/Summary:

All clones that were fed have started showing obvious signs of senescence.
Their morphology is flat and egg like in appearence or flat and stretched with
spiked boarders. Decided to proceed with a 100% feed and allow the cells time
to overcome senescence. Media colour should be monitored over the next two
weeks.
