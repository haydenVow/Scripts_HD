Steps taken (repeated on each day that pH samples were taken for testing):

  1. Use the Hanna pH probe (Checker pH tester, model code: HI98103) and calibrate with a two point (pH7 and pH4) calibration prior to use on the samples.
  2. Check the pH readings of each sample after calibration and rinse the probe with fresh ultrapure (type I) water between each sample/calibration buffer.
  3. Record the pH readings from the probe in the table below
