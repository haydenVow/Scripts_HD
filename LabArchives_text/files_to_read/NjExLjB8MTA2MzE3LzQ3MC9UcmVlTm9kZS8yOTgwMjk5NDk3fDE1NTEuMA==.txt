Total media required: 90 mL

Total p38i required: 45 uL




Prepare materials for thaw and seed:

1\. Gelatin coated  3  x  T175  flasks/plates with sterile filtered 0.1%
gelatin solution and then incubated all coated flasks at 37ºC  (Note there are
some in the fridge)

  * Time when all flasks placed into the incubator 11 :00 
  * Upon realising that there were pre-coated gelatin flask already in the cell expansion fridge three of them were transfered into the Thermo incubator to warm up 11:20   

  * T175 flasks that were coated were removed from the Thermo Incubator (#82)  12:00 , parafilmed and stored in the cell expansion fridge (#38).  

2\. Aliquotted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then
placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath for a minimum of 20 minutes
prior to use:

  *  Growth media (for seeding):   90 mL in  1x 120 mL  pot   

  * Time that aliquot was placed in the water bath to warm before use:   11:12 

  




## Thaw and seed vial:

  1. Collected the cryovial from Liquid Nitrogen storage & place in foam floater in water bath for 5 min 11:41  \- 11:46 
  2. Location where cryovial was collected from: 

Vial details:  1   x  DOLLY12  cryovials at   540K  cells each for a total of
540K  cells

Tower/Bucket # 1

Box/Cane # 1

Vial location: A2

Vial ID(s): 2201-Culture-6066-Vial-2of74  

` `

  1. `Ethanol sprayed & transferred the vial(s) to the BSC.`
  2. `Added 500 µL of Growth media (to generate a total volume of 1 mL in the cyrovial) to the cyrovial, reuspended the cell suspension gently to reduce osmotic shock. `
  3. `Collected the entire 1 mL of cell suspension and transfer into the prewarmed tube of growth media. `
  4. `Using a serological pipette, resuspend and distribute the cells evenly in the   90 mL of pre-warmed Growth media. `
  5. `Transfered   30 mL to each pre-coated   T175 flask, allow to rest in the BSC at RT for 30 minutes 11:54  -  12:24 ```
  6. `Transfered flask/plate(s) to incubate at: `

  * [X]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells) THERMO
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (aviary cells)

  

Making labels

Note - You will need to increase the passage number by one. (i.e. if your
thawed vial ID has a passage number of 3, when you make a culture ID for you
vessel you will need change the passage number to 4 on Airtable.)
