Process:

Preparing BSA standard curve:

  * Make up stock of 2 mg/ml BSA solution
  * Perform serial dilutions to make up 1000, 750, 500, 250, 125, 25, 12.5, 10, 7.5, 5, 0 ug/ml solutions of BSA in triplicate (see plate map). Place on ice.

Improved freeze-thaw lysis method:

  * Remove media from wells and wash multiple times with PBS to remove serum proteins that may affect analysis. Last PBS wash should be just enough to cover wells ( 200uL)
  * Seal plate thoroughly with adhesive foil
  * Place the plate directly in LN2 bath for 3 minutes.
  * Thaw in water bath for 3 minutes.
  * Repeat process 3 more times.

Cycle 1: 14:52 - 14:58  

Cycle 2: 14:59 - 15:05  

Cycle 3:  15:06 - 15:12  

  * Transferred lysate to 1.8mL microfuge tube.
  * Centrifuge tube/s at 650g for 5 mins.  15:22 - 15:27 am/pm
  * Aspirate 100uL of supernatant and transfer to corresponding well on a fresh non treated 96 well plate. Keep plate cold by placing on ice.
  * Perform dilutions in the well plate using water or PBS (ensure that whichever one that is used is also used as the blank) as the diluent.
  * Prepare parent, 1:2, 1:5 dilutions of sample in triplicate
  * In a new 96 well plate, add 230uL bradford reagent to the corresponding wells.
  * Add 20uL of the sample to each of the corresponding wells.
  * Mix well and spin plate down for 5 mins to remove bubbles (also the incubation time).
  * Read at 595nm using plate reader.




Observations/Summary:

  * 150uL PBS was fine for freeze/thaw.
  * 20/230uL ratio shows up in the lower end of the curve (just below middle).
  * Tested 40uL and 30uL of sample and the abs value was around 0.47 which is desirable.
  * Need to use 40uL of BSA for standard curve and 40uL of sample instead of 20uL when dealing with immature cells.
