Perform passage using below volumes:




## Performed by: Katie

Note: June 16th there was no sign of sheets forming with TGFb+vit C, so the
decision was made to wait an additional 24h before weighing and harvesting.  




Relevant Images/Figures (if applicable):

Before passaging, images were captured of each dish.

Process:

1\. Aliquotted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then
placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath for a minimum of 20 minutes
prior to use:

  1. TrypLE:    20 mL   mL in   1x 50 mL    tube
  2. dPBS (for washing)   20 mL   mL in   1x 50 mL   tube
  3. Times that all aliquots were placed in the water bath to warm before use 14:35

Note: if aliquots were placed in water bath at different times, record the
time stamp for each individual solution.




1.5 Weigh empty 100mm plate. Weight =20.088g

2\. Weigh empty tubes

  1. Tube 1 (Vit C + TGF) = 12.586g
  2. Tube 2 (Vit C only) = 12.580g
  3. Tube 3 (negative control #1) = 12.565g
  4. Tube 4 (negative control #2) = 12.822g

3\. Washed the flask(s) with dPBS. Weigh the empty flasks with cells.

  1. Plate 1 (Vit C + TGF) = 20.451
  2. Plate 2 (Vit C only) = 20.557
  3. Plate 3 (negative control #1) = 20.536
  4. Plate 4 (negative control #2) = 20.870

  

 Added    5   mL tryple to each vessel/well and incubated at 37˚C for    11
min.

Added    5   mL tryple to each vessel/well and incubated at 37˚C for    18
min.

Note: Fibroblasts typically require 15-18 minutes of incubation with tryple,
slightly longer than MuSCs.

  1. Start/Finish time for tryple was    15:40      \-    15:51       

  2. Start/Finish time for tryple was   15:44       \-    15:55       

  3. Start/Finish time for tryple was    15:48      \-    16:07       

  4. Start/Finish time for tryple was   15:48       \-    16:07     




5\. Aspirate cell suspension from all plates and transfer into sterile pre-
weighed 50 mL tubes

6\. Wash flask with 5 mL room temperature dPBS

7\. Centrifuge tubes at 650 x g for 5 minutes

  1. Start/Finish centrifuge time was 16:11-16:16

8\. Aspirate supernatant + blotted upturned ethanol sprayed Rediwipe to remove
residual liquid.

9\. Weight tubes containing cell pellet

  1. Tube 1 (6836 Vit C + TGF) =  12.662
  2. Tube 2 (6837 Vit C only) =  12.658
  3. Tube 3 (Negative control #1) = 12.565
  4. Tube 4 (Negative control #2) = 12.822

Weight of pellet:

  1. Tube 1 (6836 Vit C + TGF) =  0.076g
  2. Tube 2 (6837 Vit C only) =  0.078g
  3. Tube 3 (negative control #1) = 0.07g
  4. Tube 4 (negative control #2) = 0.07g

Observations/Summary: typlised cells detached from the plate more quickly in
samples 1 & 2 (treated) compared to the untreated samples (3 &4) which
required an additional 5 minutes to detatch. When viewed under the microscope,
treated cells had become detached in sheet like clusters (which folded and
floated around), where as untreated cells detached from the plate as
individual cells.
