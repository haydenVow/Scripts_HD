Process
  
  
  1. Received 6M cells from 50/50 culture and 6M cells from 75/25 culture from EPIC31426 (lab book link)
  2. Centrifuged for 5 min at 500 x g 
  3. Aspirated 100% of supernatant 
  4. Re-suspended each 6M in 20 mL of respective media 
  5. Split each 20 mL cell suspension into 2 x E125s (4 total) 
  6. Topped up each E-flask with 10 mL to a total of 20 mL 
  7. Replaced flasks in incubator (120 RPM, 37'C, 5% CO2)
