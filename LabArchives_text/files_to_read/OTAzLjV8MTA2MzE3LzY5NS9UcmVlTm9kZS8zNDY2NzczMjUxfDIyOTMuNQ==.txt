6612-DOLLY12-Sheep P13-1of1 this is the culture ID in the meantime  
  
MTT of insert plastic and base of wells (remove scaffolds first!):

\- Pre-warm DMEM/F12 + 20% FBS + 1X P/S (enough to fill all wells in the
plate). 11:00 - 11:20  
\- Using sterile tweezers move zein samples into new 24-well plate containing
pre-warmed media (NO INSERTS NECESSARY)  
\- Return samples to incubator (future use with janus green testing)  
  
Prepare MTT solution:

\- Pre-warm DMEM (2ml per well) = 24 mL DMEM 10:30 - 10:45  
\- Add 5mg/ml MTT powder and mix well = 120 mg MTT  

\- Returned to water bath 10:55 - 11:45  

  
To each well + insert which contained scaffolds (cell-laden and cell-free) add
2ml of MTT solution and leave for 1hr in the incubator (37'C, 5% CO2) 11:56 -
12:10  
  
Visually inspect the insert plastic after 1 hr

Well inserts have a purple tinge over all inserts:

Wells without inserts:

Cell Free
Cell Seeded

  

  

Observations:

There is traces of purple residue on the bottom of the cell seeded wells but
not the cell free. There is a purple tinge over all inserts.

  

On the inserts which contained cell-laden samples is there purple staining on
the plastic? i.e. did cells settle on the insert plastic? or did the cells all
fall through to underneath the insert? is the base of the well underneath the
insert stained purple?  

No cells could be seen on the well inserts for cell seeded or cell free
samples using the microscope. All well inserts, cell seeded and cell free had
a purple tinge from the MTT, seen by eye.

  

Cells could be seen on the bottom of the wells for the cell seeded samples.
Some black/purple residues and spots which looked like cells could also be
seen on the bottom of the wells for the cell free samples. The base of the
well uinderneath the insert is not completely stained purple, although
black/purple residues are present.

Reagents used:

DMEM/F12 + 20% FBS + 1X P/S: M4533  

DMEM: S2002  

MTT: S884  




After the MTT clean all available 24-well insert plates (eucalyptus, water
rinse, MilliQ water soak, to make sure no trace of detergent remains on the
plastic, autoclave) then give to Lily. 14:37
