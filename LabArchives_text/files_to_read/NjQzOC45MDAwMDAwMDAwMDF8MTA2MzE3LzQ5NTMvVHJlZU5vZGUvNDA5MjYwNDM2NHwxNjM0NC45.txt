Results and Data Analysis (MCB vs WCB study)


DAPI-stained 96-well plates were imaged on the Zaber platform at 45 ms
exposure (UV), and images were run through mia macro
"zaber_96_well_dapi_count". Resulting raw DAPI count data was transferred to
Prism 8 (GraphPad) for further analysis.

  

Note* Above zaber macro resulted in multiple false readings, and it was
determined that the suspension DAPI macro resulted in much more accurate cell
counts for each image.

The suspension macro was used for the below results.




 Graph 1. Comparison of cell counts over 10 days of differentiation between
DOLLY12 MCB and DOLLY12 WCB cells in both E6 and 2% HS differentiation media.
Blue = MCB cells, Red = WCB cells. Closed Box = E6, open box = 2% HS. n = 8
for each data point. Error bars show standard deviation
