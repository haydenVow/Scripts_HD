The literature below reveals that mechanical stimulation can be used to
improve myogenesis and maturation. However, the stimulus must be judiciously
applied. Continuous cyclic stretching has been shown in some cases to inhibit
both the differentiation of myogenic stem cells and the maturation of
myotubes. It appears that waiting for myotubes to reach a certain level of
maturity, and allowing myotubes long periods of rest between periods of
stimulation, can greatly improve the maturation of myotubes. Mechanical
stimulation can increase myotube diameter by 12 - 100%, or 25 - 300% increase
in cross sectional area (Powell et al., 2002 and Somers et al., 2019).

The recommendation is to try the following:

  * Strain range: 0-15%
  * Strain rate range: 0-20%/s
  * Strain modes: periodic stretch and hold without relaxation (stretch over 0-16 days), continuous cyclic stretch and relaxation (0-1 Hz), periodic cyclic stretch and relaxation (0-1Hz, 0-6 hours per day)
  * Onset of strain: 0-5 days after onset of differentiation
  * Metrics: cell proliferation rate (should be close to zero), % cell alignment (should be close to 100%), % cell differentiation (should be close to 100%), mean myotube diameter (should be increased by mechanical stimulus compared to non-stimulated control), myosin heavy chain protein coverage % (should be increased by mechanical stimulus compared to non-stimulated control).

Summary: cyclic stretch promoted cardiomyocyte alignment, maintenance, and
maturation, with enhanced expression of typical mature cardiac markers
compared to static controls. Total amount of collagen did not vary
significantly along the culture. ECTs did not spontaneously beat.

Summary: response of vascular smooth muscle cells (vSMCs) cultured in
different culture environments (2D cell monolayers and 3D cellularized
collagen-based gels) in combination with mechanical stimulation (7% uniaxial
cyclic strain, 1 Hz) for 2 and 5 days. Specifically, in 2D configuration,
cyclic strain caused âˆ¼50% of cell population to align nearly perpendicular
(80-90 degrees) to the strain direction, while not influencing the
contractile-phenotype protein expression, as compared to the 2D static
controls.

Human bioartificial muscles (HBAMs) are tissue engineered by suspending muscle
cells in collagen/MATRIGEL, casting in a silicone mold containing end
attachment sites, and allowing the cells to differentiate for 8 to 16 days.
The resulting HBAMs are representative of skeletal muscle in that they contain
parallel arrays of postmitotic myofibers; however, they differ in many other
morphological characteristics.  
Repetitive stretch/relaxation for 8 days increased the HBAM elasticity two- to
threefold, mean myofiber diameter 12%, and myofiber area percent 40%.

The engineered grafts in strained groups were subjected to 10% strain
amplitude for 6 h per day. We found that both static and cyclic uniaxial
strains resulted in similar morphological and gene expres- sion outcomes.
However, relative to 0% strain groups, there were stark increases in myotube
diameter, myosin heavy chain (MHC) coverage, and expression of key myogenic
genes (Pax 7, Troponin, MHC I, MHC IIb, MHC IIx) only if strain was applied at
Days 5-7 rather than Days 3-7.

Previously, satellite cells were isolated from adult bovine muscle and it was
shown that the cells are multipotent, i.e., capable of proliferating and to
differentiating into both myoblasts and adipocytes. This study investigated
the cellular mechanisms by which cyclic mechanical stretching modulates the
proliferation and differentiation of adult bovine satellite cells. The
application of cyclic stretch induced the proliferation of satellite cells and
inhibited their differentiation into myotubes. This response is believed to be
closely related to the stretch-mediated changes in the expression of myogenic
and cell cycle regulatory factors. Cyclic stretching increased the level of
extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) phosphorylation, whereas a
specific ERK inhibitor (PD98058) blocked the stretch-mediated inhibition of
myogenesis in a dose-dependent manner.
