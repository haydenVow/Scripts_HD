### Process:

1\. Took image of wells across all culture plates on the 31st of March and the
1st of April using the Zaber whole well imaging system under 4x objective,
Phase.

  1. Went through the images by eye to determine which wells (up to a max of 14) contained >50% confluence coverage (see well pick list in reference images) 
  2. These wells were then selected for passaging into 24 well plates. 

2\.  14 wells on each of 4x24 well plates were filled with 1mL of growth media
(DMEM/F12 + 20% FBS + 1xP/S)




  

Plates were passaged two at a time, steps 3-4 performed for each plate prior
to moving to step 5.

3\. Plates were removed from the incubator and all supernatant was aspirated
and discarded.

4\. Wells were washed with 50uL of dPBS, washes were then discarded and
replaced with 50uL of Tryple+EDTA before plates were returned to incubate at
30 degrees, 5% CO2 for 8-10 minutes.

5\. The contents of each well were collected and transferred to individual
wells on a destination plates containing growth media. destination plates were
then returned the passaged plates back to the incubator (#82, 30 degrees C, 5%
CO2).  
  
Clone destination wells were given new clone ID's.
