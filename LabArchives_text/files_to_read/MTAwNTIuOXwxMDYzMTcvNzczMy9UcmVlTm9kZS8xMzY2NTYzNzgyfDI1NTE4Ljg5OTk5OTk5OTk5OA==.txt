    2. Run time:
  3. While protocol was running, prepared 5 x control media conditions: 
    1. Control 1: (base medium) RPMI + 3 mg/mL yeast + 0.02 mg/mL L-Ornithine monohydrochloride + 0.06 mg/mL Putrescine dihydrochloride + 0.00005 mg/mL IGF-1-LR3 + 0.00001 mg/mL EGF + 0.0001 mg/mL FGF-B \+ 1 g/L poloxamer-188 base medium
    2. Control 2: RPMI \+ Nuvonis ingredients at recommended conc.
    3. Control 3: 90/10 RPMI/HyCell \+ 3 mg/mL yeast + 0.02 mg/mL L-Ornithine monohydrochloride + 0.06 mg/mL Putrescine dihydrochloride + 0.00005 mg/mL IGF-1-LR3 + 0.00001 mg/mL EGF + 0.0001 mg/mL FGF-B \+ 1 g/L poloxamer-188 base medium
    4. Control 4: 75/25 RPMI/HyCell + 3 mg/mL yeast + other Nuvonis ingredients at recommended conc.
