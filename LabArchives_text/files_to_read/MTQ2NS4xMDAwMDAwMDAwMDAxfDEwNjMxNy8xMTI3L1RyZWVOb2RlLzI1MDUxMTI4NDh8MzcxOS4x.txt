Perform feed using below volumes (may be able to add more or less depending on
scaffold size):

96-well plate = at least 200ul per well

48-well plate with inserts = 1mL

24-well plate with inserts = 2ml  
  
NOTE - A high media volume is typically required per sample due to the high
cell seed densities used, and thus the high turn-over of media nutrients - it
is recommended that samples are cultured in wells larger than their size to
accommodate for excess media




Growth Media:

  * [ X]  E6

Total media required:96 mL

Process:

1\. Aliquotted   2mL per well (total 96 mL)  of  E6 into  2 x 24 well plate.
Placed in incubator for at least 30 minutes.    9:30 am

2\. Carefully transfer cup and trays into new 24 well plate with fresh pre
warmed media.

4\. Returned vessel to incubate at:

  * [x]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (aviary cells)

  

  * Incubator (#thermo  ), Lab [Main]
