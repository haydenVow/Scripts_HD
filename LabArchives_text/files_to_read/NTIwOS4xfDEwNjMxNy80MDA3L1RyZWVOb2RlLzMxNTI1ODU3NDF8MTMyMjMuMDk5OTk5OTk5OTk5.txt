Media located in the biomaterial fridge in a 120 mL container. This media will
be shared across three experiment. (suggest that you feed the 96 wp first,
using 4 tips on a multi channel)

Process:

  1. Aliquotted   18 mL  mL of  E6 Media  (Note that E6 media that has been aliquoted is for multiple experiments)
  2. Placed in water bath   09:26 am    

  3. Removed plate from the incubator and place in BSC (lights off)
  4. Removed parafilm from plate. 
  5. Carefully remove  100 % of supernatant from each well with a p1000. See tips below:
    1. You can use the same tip across the samples containing cells, however switch tips for the control. Refer to plate map for the position. 
    2. Place tip on the side of the well and slowly aspirate
    3. Be careful not to touch or suck up the gel
    4. Tilting the plate slightly may help, however try not to dislodge the gel from the inserts
  6. Replaced with  1.5 mL (per well/per vessel) of  E6  media. 
    1. Slowly release the media onto the side of the well and NOT directly on the gel.  
  7. Parafilm plate and return vessel to incubate at: 10:54 am
