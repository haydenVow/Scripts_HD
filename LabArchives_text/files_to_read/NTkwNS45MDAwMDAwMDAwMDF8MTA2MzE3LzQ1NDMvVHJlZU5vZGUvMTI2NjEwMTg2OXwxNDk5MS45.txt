At the completion of any EPIC please do the following:  
1\. Ensure all sections of this page are complete  
2\. Email a link to this page to the project leader  
3\. Project leaders will then review all information and digitally sign this
page (click the screwdriver and wrench icon in the top right of this page)

RELATED TO MILESTONE:  

## KR1: Develop a QMS-compliant serum-free media that supports 20+ doublings
of our chosen species in suspension

KR4: Establish and run a suspension pipeline at a rate of 10,000 clones per
month.

AIM/PURPOSE: To develop a OT2 protocol for feeding a 24 deep well plate and
maintain sterility during this process.

HYPOTHESIS:

We can successfully perform a 100% feed of a 24 deep well plate on OT2.

Using adhesive covers for a 24 deep well plate will allow us to maintain
sterility.

RESULTS SUMMARY:

An OT2 protocol for performing a 100% feed of a 24 dwp was successfully
developed. No contamination was observed as adhesive covers were used for
covering the 24 dwp.

CONCLUSIONS: The hypothesis was supported.

NEXT STEPS:

24 dwp should be secured down onto shakers using clamps (EPIC27984)

Test shaking of 24 dwp and 96 wp on a shaker with larger orbital diameter
(EPIC27984).

Compare suspension adaptation of cells in 24 dwp versus 50 mL shake tubes
versus E125 flasks (EPIC27984).
