Generate at least 1 suspension-adapted fibroblast cell line which is >95% viable and proliferates for >14 days.


Scoring Guide:

0.25 = Fibroblasts proliferate in suspension for >6 days and are 80% viable.

0.5 = Fibroblasts proliferate in suspension for >10 days and are 90% viable.

0.75 = Fibroblasts proliferate in suspension for >14 days, are >95% viable,
and appear "suspension adapted" by all known metrics.

1.0 = Suspension-adapted fibroblasts have been successfully banked and
revived, with post-revival viability and growth-rate at least as good as
before banking.

Considerations:

  1. At least 2 species  (we will try with at least 2 species....chicken fibroblasts grow like weeds, maybe we should try them).
  2. Greater than 90% viable
  3. Greater than 14 days of continuous culture
  4. Can be banked & revived
