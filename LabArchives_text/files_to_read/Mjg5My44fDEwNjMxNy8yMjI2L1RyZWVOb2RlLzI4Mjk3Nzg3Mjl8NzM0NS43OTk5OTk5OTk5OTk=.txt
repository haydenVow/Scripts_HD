Culture IDs to feed

Vessel ID(s)  
Vessel Type(s)  
  
7136-DOLLY12-Sheep P13-1of1 (also has a culture ID for C2C12s)  
48WP (scaffolds with inserts)  
  
7139-DOLLY12-Sheep P13-1of1  
48WP (adherent culture - no inserts)  
  
  
  




  




Process:

1\. Collected:

  * Foil-wrapped 48-WP from "Biomaterials" fridge in Main Lab labelled "LL WED EPIC18701".  
  * 15 mL tube from "Biomaterials" fridge labelled "LL WED" (this aliquot is also for 96WP feed from EPIC19524)
  * Placed tube in waterbath and plate in incubator (plate needs at least 30 minutes in incubator)  11:15 - 11:45  

2\. Retrieved culture plates and foil-wrapped media plate from Thermo
incubator. Retrieved 15 mL tube from waterbath. Ethanol sprayed and brought
into BSC.

SCAFFOLD FEED

3\. Using a well-ethanol sprayed hand, lifted tray insert from 48WP with
scaffolds by the edge and lifted into pre-filled 48-WP with warmed, fresh
media (ensure the plates are oriented the same way so that the correct inserts
go into the correct wells). Moved lid from original plate to new plate to keep
labelling and culture ID in place.

PLANAR FEED

4\. Aspirated 250 uL (100%) of media from each well (A1 - A5) of 48WP with
adherent cultures (no scaffolds). Replaced with 250 uL per well from 15 mL
tube. Returned to incubator

5\. Re-parafilmed scaffold plate and returned vessels to incubate at:  11:51

  * [x]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (aviary cells)

  

  * Incubator (#Thermo), Lab [Main/Library/Production]
