Laminin2502  
  
(Product No. L2020 Laminin from Engelbreth-Holm-Swarm murine sarcoma basement
membrane)-20 freezer

  1. Thaw laminin at 2 - 8 °C; avoid rapid thawing to prevent formation of a gel.
  2. Dilute 20x (to ~50 ug/mL) in balanced salt solution. Solution concentration is dependent upon the application. A typical stock concentration is 0.01%.
  3. For 3 wells, add 100 uL laminin to 1.9 mL dPBS (with excess).
  4. Coat culture surface with a minimal volume (0.5mL)
  5. Once the entire area is covered, remove excess solution. This can be used to coat another well/plate.
  6. Incubate at 37°C for 30 minutes, start 10:07

Collagen (PureCol)3850E6 components fridge, top row (-20 fridge)

  1. dilute stock 5-fold on ice, for 3 wells add 0.5 mL PureCol to 2 mL PBS
  2. add 0.5 mL per well to cover base
  3. place plate in inc. 37C for 30 min, start 10:07

Gelatin7508We also made up fresh gelatin yesterday, so can possibly borrow
from cell expansion fridge (Mix 7508)

  1. add 0.5 mL of 0.1% gelatin per well, time 09:57 am
  2. place plate in inc. 37C for 30 min, start 10:07
  3. remove gelatin and seed cells

  
41  
ECM3849E6 components fridge, top row (-20 fridge)

  1. Gel should be thawed overnight at 2-8°C before use and dispensed to a multiwell plate using a plate and pipettes that are pre-cooled to 2-8°C. 
  2. The gel may also be diluted up to twofold with 2-8°C Dulbecco′s Modified Eagle′s Medium, and should be done before gel is added to the plate. 1 mL of ECM in 1 mL DMEM: very viscous stock and sticky even after dilution  

  3. Added 1 mL to first well and second well, dialled pipette to 500 uL and transferred 500 uL form 1st and 2nd well to last well, then removed 500uL from last well to cover all surfaces, time 9.55 am  

  4. The product will gel within 5 minutes at 20°C. For prolonged manipulations, work should be conducted below 10°C. 
  5. Cells can be plated on top of a thin gel layer of 0.5 mm

Fibrin (thrombin-free)888(8mg/ml) fibrinogen is in -20C where E6 components
are (red cap, first drawer),  

  1. coating with fibrinogen (8mg/mL) diluted in well 1-1 with 100 mM Calcium
  2. incubate at 37C for 30 min and remove excess, start 9:40 am
  3. dry for 45 min before plating cells

MyoCult1553-20 fridge (second drawer), library lab

  1. add 50 μL of MyoCult™-SF Attachment Substrate to 2.45 mL of D-PBS (Aliquot ID 7356).
  2. add 500 uL per 12wp well (had to add additional 500uL to break surface tension, subsequently removed to next well)
  3. Seal cultureware to avoid evaporation (e.g. using Parafilm®). Incubate at 2 ­ 8°C overnight, fridge 102
  4. Immediately prior to plating cells, gently tilt the cultureware onto one side and allow the excess substrate solution to collect at the edge.
  5. Remove the excess solution using a serological pipette or by aspiration.

Alginate (on top of cells)7461Biomaterials fridge

  1. seed cells
  2. after 1h attachment, wash well briefly with warmed 50 mM CaCl2 in DMEM (1-1 dilution of 100mM CaCl2 stock)
  3. Add 500 uL of 4% alginate and crosslink for 10 min
  4. add GM and continue incubation
