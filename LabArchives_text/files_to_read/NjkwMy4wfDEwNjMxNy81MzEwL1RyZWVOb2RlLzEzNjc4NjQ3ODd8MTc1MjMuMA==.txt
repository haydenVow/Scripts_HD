Vow's goal is to manufacture it's first ever commercial product using
crocodile fibroblast paste as a key ingredient. It is therefore important to
adapt crocodile fibroblast cells to suspension, so that culture of these cells
can be scaled-up to commercially-useful volumes (in the 100-1000 L range) by
the end of 2022. Previous experiments have demonstrated that the following
conditions are adequate for adherent proliferation of crocodile fibroblasts:

ParameterValueCommentReference  
Temperature (degrees Celsius)30Two temperatures were tested, 30 deg C and 37
deg C; proliferation was suppressed at 37 deg C.EPIC23083  
Atmospheric CO2 concentration (%)5This is the standard CO2 enrichment used in
incubators at Vow.EPIC23083  
Growth mediumDMEM/F12 + 20% FBSTwo FBS concentrations were tested, 10% and
20%; proliferation was suppressed at 10%.EPIC23083  
Osmolality (mOsm/kg)~300Inferred from growth medium

All crocodilians studied to date, from both fresh and salt water, maintain
their plasma osmolality in the range  280-340  mOsm/kg,  with Na and Cl as the
principal  osmolytes. Interspecific  variability is small.

However, a previous experiment (EPIC25749) showed that the medium mix that was
useful for adapting DOLLY12 fibroblasts to suspension from DMEM/F12 + 10% FBS
medium was not adequate for CHOMP09 fibroblasts.

Therefore, different basal media were tested for F_CHOMP suspension adaption
(EPIC26265 \- still in progress).

For most of the suspension adaptation experiment performed last quarter, 50 mL
shake tubes were used instead of E125 flasks as they are easier to automate,
and require less media and cells. However, data from EPIC25749  suggests that
higher cell density (cells/mL) is maintained throughout the suspension
adaption process when E125 flasks are used versus 50 mL shake tubes. It is
possible a similar effect will be observed with 24 deep well plates too. But
if suspension adaptation can be successfully be performed in 24 dwp, it would
be possible to perform media optimisation experiments with even higher
throughput and less resources (media and cells).
