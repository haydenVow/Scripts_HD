AIM/PURPOSE: Determine maximum cell density for Nuvonis using optimised media
and culture conditions provided by SOP in tech transfer

HYPOTHESIS: Nuvonis cells will be able to achieve a maximum density of 4M
cells/mL before viability is negatively affected (as per correspondence with
creators of cell line (Nuvonis, Baxter).

RESULTS SUMMARY: This experiment was terminated early due to redundancy in
experiment design and coverage (Adrian Kotevski has also designed and has been
carrying out similar experiments. Handover was completed 3/3/2022 to carry
over design insights.

CONCLUSIONS: Data here showed that cell viability did not alter over time and
remained >95% as cells approached 1M/mL density. pH appeared to decrease as
cell density increased.

NEXT STEPS: Experiment has been ended and handed over to Adrian Kotevski for
completion.
