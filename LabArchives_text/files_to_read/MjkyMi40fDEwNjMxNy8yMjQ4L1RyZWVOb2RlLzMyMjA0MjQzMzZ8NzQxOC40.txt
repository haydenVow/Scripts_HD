Process:

  1. Aliquoted  2 x 5 mL of  growth Media into  1 x 15 mL   falcon tubes(s).  time 
  2. Placed medium aliquot in water bath   12:07pm     

  3. Stopped the shaker and removed cultures from the incubator before restarting the shaker   12:22pm    

  4. Placed suspension flask(s) inside the BSC and allowed to sit static for 3-5 minutes to allow microcarriers to settle to the base of the flask. 
  5. Carefully removed  50  % ( 5 mL) of supernatant from the flask(s) by pipetting slowly and following the meniscus with the pipette tip so as to avoid placing the pipette tip near the microcarriers at the base of the flask(s). 
  6. Replaced with   5 mL (per well/per vessel) of   growth  media for both 50 mL tubes.
  7. Stopped the shaker and returned vessel to incubate at:   12:27pm  , incubator #  68  before restarting the shaker
