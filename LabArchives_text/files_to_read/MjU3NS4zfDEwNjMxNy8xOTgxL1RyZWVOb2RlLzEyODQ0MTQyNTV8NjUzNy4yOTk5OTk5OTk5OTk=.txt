Growth Media:

  * [x]  DMEM/F12 + 20% FBS + 1X P/S + P38i (10uM)

  




### Process:

3\. [18/06/21] Aliquotted the required volume of each reagent in the table
above and then placed all aliquots in the fridge at 4 degrees,

  1. TrypLE:     1x22    mL in    1x50mL     tubes
  2.  dPBS (for washing and neutralising):     1x44    mL in   1x50mL     tubes. 
  3. Growth media (for seeding and resuspension):     2x120    mL in     2x250mL    containers. (one sample for clone 21L10, one sample for clone 25K6). 




Removed aliquots from the fridge and placed all to warm in the water bath for
a minimum of 20 minutes prior to use:  

Time that all aliquots were placed in the water bath the warm before use
11:50  

Note: if aliquots were placed in water bath at different time, record the time
stamp for each individual solution.

1\. Took image of vessel with microscope on phase setting, 5x objective.

2\. Gelatin coated    8   x     T175     vessel with sterile filtered 0.1%
gelatin solution and then incubated all coated flasks at 37˚C.

  1. Time when all vessels(s) placed into the incubator       11:55  

3\. Looked at flasks under microscope

Note: 7150 definitely ready for passage but 7151 is not very confluent - will
passage but may end up just going back into 1 x T175

4\. Removed vessel(s) from the incubator     12:25  

5\. Washed the vessel(s) with dPBS (warmed) (10mL).

6\. Added     10    mL tryple to each vessel/well and incubated at 37˚C.

  1. Start/Finish for TrypLE was     12:30 - 12:42  

7\. Neutralised with     10     dPBS and combined cell suspension into a    2
x 50 mL   tubes.

8\. Centrifuged at 650 x g for 5 min.

  1. Start/Finish time for centrifugation was     12:50 - 12:55   

9\. Coated additional 3 x T75 in case 7151 gets low cell count - concerned
after seeing density of cells in Tryple. Timestamp in incubator: 12:53  




9\. Aspirated the supernatant(s).

10\. Resuspended pellet(s) in    500 uL (7151) 1000 uL (7150)   of    Growth
media     12:56  

11\. Aliquoted    2 x 10 uL   of resuspended cells into 2 x microcentrifuge
tubes for cell count.

12\. Performed a cell count using the haemocytometer and recorded the cell
count data in the Google Doc spreadsheet called 'Cell Count Spreadsheet' (see
link below):

7150

  1. Total cell number was:      784,000     

  2. Volume of cell suspension required for subculture was: (seeding into 4xT175s)     1000 uL      

  3. Cell density per vessel:    196K per flask - 1.12K / cm2       
  
7151

  4.  Total cell number was:     150,000      

  5. Volume of cell suspension required for subculture was: (seeding into 2xT75s)     500 uL      

  6. Cell density per vessel:    75K per flask - 1K / cm2     




13\. Transferred     1000  of cell suspension to the pre-warmed     120  mL
Growth media:     13:22  

14\. Transferred    500 uL   of cell suspension to the pre-warmed     24   mL
Growth media:  13:22  

15\. Transferred cell suspension into the pre-gelatin coated    4 x T175s  

16\. Transferred cell suspension into the pre-gelatin coated    2 x T75s
(waited for gelatin to be ready - done at 14:01)  

17\. Left T175s RT in the BSC for 30 min to allow cells to settle     13:28
\- 13:58  

18\. Left T75s in the BSC for 30 min to allow cells to settle      14:01  -
14:31  

16\. Transferred vessel(s) to incubate at:

  * [x]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (avian cells)

Observations/Summary:

Culture ID 7151 (25K6) looked to be far less confluent than 7150, and cell
count confirmed this. Seeded into 2xT75s to keep seeding density at at least
1K cells per cm2
