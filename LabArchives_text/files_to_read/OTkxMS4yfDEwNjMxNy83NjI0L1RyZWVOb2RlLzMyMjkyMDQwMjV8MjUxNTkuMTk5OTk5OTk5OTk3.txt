Prepare materials for thaw and seed:

1\. Aliquotted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then
placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath for a minimum of 20 minutes
prior to use:

  * Growth media (for resuspension from FBS+DMSO):     10mL growth media 
    * Time that aliquot was placed in the water bath to warm before use:  11:15am
  * Growth media (for seeding):     375mL growth media +      uL vit.C
    * Time that aliquot was placed in the water bath to warm before use:   12:38pm

  




## Thaw and seed vial:

  1. Collected the cryovial from Liquid Nitrogen storage & place in foam floater in water bath for 5 min  : - : a/pm 
  2. Location where cryovial was collected from: 

Vial details:   5 x  CHOND_NANDO07 MCB cryovials at   2,000,000 cells each for
a total of    10,000,000 cells

Tower/Bucket #6

Box/Cane #6  

Vial location: 1C-5C  

Vial ID(s): 14474-14478  

` `

  1. `Ethanol sprayed & transferred the vial(s) to the BSC.`
  2. `Added 500 µL of Growth media (to generate a total volume of 1 mL in the cyrovial) to the cyrovial, reuspended the cell suspension gently to reduce osmotic shock. `
  3. `Collected the entire 1 mL of cell suspension and transfer into the prewarmed tube of growth media. `
  4. `Complete a cell count from a 10uL aliquot.   
`

cell count: 13,620,000 cells in 15mL of Growth Media

  *  SA 2CF: 1264cm^2, seed 7500 cells/cm^2 = 9,480,000
  * Cells leftover: 4,140,000 cells
  * SA T175: 175cm^2, seed 7885.71 cells/cm^2 into 3x T175 (i.e seed leftover cells (4,140,000) into 3X T175s evenly)

  

  1. `Using a serological pipette, resuspend and distribute the 15mL of cell suspension evenly in the  375 mL of pre-warmed Growth media. `
  2. `Transfered   30 mL to each  3x  T175, and 1x 2CF flask/well, allow to rest in the BSC at RT for 30 minutes  : - : a/pm ```
  3. `Transfered flask/plate(s) to incubate at: `

  * [X]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells) - Incubator:           
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (aviary cells)

  

Making labels

Note - You will need to increase the passage number by one. (i.e. if your
thawed vial ID has a passage number of 3, when you make a culture ID for you
vessel you will need change the passage number to 4 on Airtable.)
