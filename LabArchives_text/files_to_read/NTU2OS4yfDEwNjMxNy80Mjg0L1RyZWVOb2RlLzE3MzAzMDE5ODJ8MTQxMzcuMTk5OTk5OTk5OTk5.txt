Aim/Purpose


To determine whether cell death observed in myogenic differentiation in Q3
experiments is cell-line specific to our DOLLY12 MuSCs or universal.


Hypothesis


That the survival of various cell lines will differ when exposed to identical
conditions, due to biological variability.


Technical Gap


Cell death has been observed in many DOLLY12 cultures, particularly prominent
in differentiation.

Once DOLLY12s were substituted for C2C12 cells, less cell death was apparent
(in the C2C12s). In combination with investigating the source of cell death
amongst incubators, reagents and other conditions; in this experiment we will
also determine whether it is a cell-line-specific phenomena that only affects
DOLLY12 cells.

Experimental Plan:

    * Revive cells from multiple species:
    * Thaw 1 x vial from each biobank highlighted green  

    * \+ 1 x C2C12 vial
    * Expand cells in adherent culture
    * Seed into differentiation assay (harvest cells, count, seed at 1,000 cells per well in 200uL per well [i.e. cell density for seeding = 5,000 cells / mL])  
3 x 96-well plates (each containing 2 columns of wells with cell, the rest of
the plate left empty) seeded for each cell line. - to be fixed at Day 0, Day 4
and Day 10  

    * 50% Feed with Growth media 48 hours after seeding
    * Once cells reach 100% confluence, change media on 2 of the 3 x 96-well plates for each cell line to E6 and 2% HS Differentiation media. (see green/yellow wells above)  
Note* Observations should be made every day of feeding (apart from weekends)
on the cell survival

    * Day 0 Diff - Fix 1 x plate of each cell line (whilst still in Growth Media)
    * Day 1 Diff - 100% Feed
    * Day 2 Diff - 100% Feed
    * Day 3 Diff - 100% Feed
    * Day 4 Diff - Fix 1 x plate of each cell line
    * Day 4 Diff - 100% Feed
    * Day 5 Diff - 100% Feed
    * Day 6 Diff - 100% Feed
    * Day 7 Diff - 100% Feed
    * Day 8 Diff - 100% Feed
    * Day 9 Diff - 100% Feed
    * Day 10 Diff - Fix final plate of each cell line
    * DAPI stain Day 4 and Day 10 fixed plates
    * Image and obtain total cell counts for Day 0, Day 4 and Day 10 plates from each cell line (ImageJ macro)
    * Determine the difference between Day 0, Day 4 and Day 10 time points
    * Assess whether all cell lines follow a trend or whether some cell lines are more prone to cell death than others.
