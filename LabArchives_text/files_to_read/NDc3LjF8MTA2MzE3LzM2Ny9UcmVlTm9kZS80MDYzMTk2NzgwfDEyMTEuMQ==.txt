# Procedure

  1. Plate ID: 6329 was removed from the incubator and transferred into the BSC  xx:xx
  2. Removed media from wells. 
  3. Wash 2x with 200ul PBS for 5 min  15:48-15:53, 15:54- 15:59  

  4. Added   80  uL of 4% PFA to each scaffold and incubated for 15min at room temperature.  16:00-16:15
  5. Washed 2x with 200ul PBS for 5 min  16:17-16:22. 16:23-16:28
  6. Added 100ul of DAPI in PBS (1:1000) to each well and incubated at room temp for 5min 16:29-16:34 .
  7. Replaced with fresh PBS for imaging

# Observations and images

Following fixation and second dapi staining, the majority of cells had been
washed away from the wells in all sample groups except for those that had been
treated with ethanol. In these samples, both the cell nucleus and the cell
body were clearly illuminated.

Due to cells being washed away, it was not possible to compare dapi staining
before and after fixation. The large number of stained nucleli, coupled with a
predominately normal cell morphology, indicates that dapi staining prior to
fixation was not limited to dead cells. Live cells appear to have taken up the
stain, despite the reduced dapi concentration used.
