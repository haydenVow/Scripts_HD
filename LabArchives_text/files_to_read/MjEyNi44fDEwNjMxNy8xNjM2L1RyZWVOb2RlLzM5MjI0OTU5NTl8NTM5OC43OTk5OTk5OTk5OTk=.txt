Aim/Purpose


To generate 96-well plates containing fixed C2C12 cells that are at different
stages of proliferation and differentiation to be used as staining controls.


Hypothesis


That generating plates with fixed C2C12 cells at different stages of
proliferation and differentiation will allow us to use a few select wells
every time MuSCs are being IF stained, as a positive control.


Technical Gap


Some antibodies have been freeze-thawed and occasionally negative fluorescent
signals are observed, but without a control we are unsure whether it is the
absence of the antigen or faulty antibodies that are giving off a negative
signal. The presence of control wells with fixed cells should allow us to
confirm whether the antibodies are working or not and reduce the questions
around antibody function.


Method/Procedure


  1. Day 0 - Thaw C2C12 cells into 3 x 96-well plates (1M cells)  
\- Gelatin coat 3 x 96-well plates  
\- Thaw 2 x vials as per revival SOP  
\- Neutralise cells and mix into 27mL of Growth Media (28mL total at ~35,714
cells / mL)  
\- Aliquot 1mL of cell suspension (~35K cells) and dilute in 12mL of Growth
Media (13mL total at ~2500 cells / mL)  
Aliquot 200uL/well of the high cell density mixture into wells B2-G11 of 2 x
96-well plates  
Aliquot 200uL/well of the low cell density mixture into wells B2-G11 of 1 x
96-well plate  
  
  
  

  2. Day 1 - 50% Feed  
Aspirate 100uL/well and add 100uL/well of Growth Media

  3. Day 2 - Fix Proliferation Plate
  4. Day 2/3 - Change 2 x 96-well plates to E6 Differentiation Media
  5. Day 1 of Differentiation - 100% Feed 2 x 96-well plates with E6
  6. Day 2 of Differentiation - 100% Feed 2 x 96-well plates with E6
  7. Day 3 of Differentiation - 100% Feed 2 x 96-well plates with E6
  8. Day 4 of Differentiation - Fix Differentiation Plate 1of2
  9. Day 4 of Differentiation - 100% Feed 1 x 96-well plate with E6
  10. Day 5 of Differentiation - 100% Feed 1 x 96-well plate with E6
  11. Day 6 of Differentiation - 100% Feed 1 x 96-well plate with E6
  12. Day 7 of Differentiation - 100% Feed 1 x 96-well plate with E6
  13. Day 8 of Differentiation - 100% Feed 1 x 96-well plate with E6
  14. Day 9 of Differentiation - 100% Feed 1 x 96-well plate with E6
  15. Day 10 of Differentiation - Fix Differentiation Plate 2of2
