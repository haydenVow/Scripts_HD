### Prepared materials:

1\. Aliquotted the required volume of each reagent and then placed all
aliquots to warm in the water bath for a minimum of 20 minutes prior to use:

  1. dPBS (for washing before Trypsinization), 100 mL per g Cytodex 1:    200     mL in   Large Urine Pot      tubes
  2. Trypsin/EDTA, 100 mL per g Cytodex 1:     30    mL in    3 x 10mL Centrifuge Tubes     tubes
  3. Growth media (for neutralizing) 100 mL per g Cytodex 1:     30    mL in    500mL Storage Bottle     tubes
  4. Poloxamer 188 (for washing microcarriers after Trypsinization),      30    mL in   Small Urine Container     tubes
  5. Growth media (for pellet resuspension):     2    mL in     500mL Storage Bottle    tubes

Time that all aliquots were placed in the water bath the warm before use
14:55   a/pm

Note: if aliquots were placed in water bath at different time, record the time
stamp for each individual solution.




## Remove the flask from incubator

  1. Stop the shaker
  2. Remove the flask from the shaker
  3. Restart the shaker
  4. Wipe down the flask with an ethanol-soaked wipe and place it in the BSC




## Sample and Hoescht Stain (Pre Harvest):

  1. Stop the shaker
  2. Remove the flask from the shaker
  3. Place culture in BSC after wiping down with an ethanol soaked wipe.
  4. Aliquot 5 x 20uL of culture suspension into 1 x 96 well plate by sampling from swirling culture suspension.
  5. Top up wells with 80ul of PBS
  6. Check wells under microscope to ensure even monolayer of microcarriers. If stacking is observed, mix gently with P200 pipette ensuring no bubbles form.
  7. Add 2uL Hoescht stain to each well and mix well with P200 ensuring no bubbles form in the process.
  8. Incubate for 15 mins 15:11 - 15:29.
  9. Image under 5X under Phase and DAPI channels.

Observation: Five replicates were imaged on PHASE and DAPI channels. Phase
images depicted a lack of "stretches" of cells across it indicating a lack of
cells on the carriers. This was then affirmed by switching to DAPI in which
there were barely any cells on each carrier. Imaging across all five
replicates indicated that are barely any cells on the carrier.

  




## First wash to remove serum:

  1. Allow the microcarriers to settle for at least 2 minutes
  2. Gently tilt the flask to an angle of approximately 30 degrees from vertical
  3. Remove the cap and aspirate the supernatant using a serological pipet - keep the tip only 5-10 mm below the surface during this procedure
  4. Transfer 15mL of the fresh, pre-warmed dPBS for prewashing to the flask using a serological pipet - wash down the insides to wash any stuck microcarriers back into the bulk suspension, then replace the cap

  




## Second wash to remove serum:

  1. Allow the microcarriers to settle for at least 2 minutes
  2. Gently tilt the flask to an angle of approximately 30 degrees from vertical
  3. Remove the cap and aspirate the supernatant using a serological pipet - keep the tip only 5-10 mm below the surface during this procedure
  4. Transfer the remaining 15mL half of the fresh, pre-warmed dPBS for prewashing to the flask using a serological pipet - wash down the insides to wash any stuck microcarriers back into the bulk suspension, then replace the cap

  




## Add detachment agent:

  1. Allow the microcarriers to settle for at least 2 minutes
  2. Gently tilt the flask to an angle of approximately 30 degrees from vertical
  3. Remove the cap and aspirate the supernatant using a serological pipet - keep the tip only 5-10 mm below the surface during this procedure
  4. Transfer 30mL of the fresh, pre-warmed Trypsin/EDTA solution to the flask using a serological pipet - wash down the insides to wash any stuck microcarriers back into the bulk suspension, then replace the cap

  




## Incubate flask:

  1. Stop the shaker
  2. Remove the flask from the BSC and transfer it back to the shaker
  3. Restart the shaker at the `speed required for detachment` \- see the table below.
  4. After 10` `minutes, stop the shaker
  5. Remove the flask from the shaker
  6. Restart the shaker
  7. Wipe down the flask with an ethanol-soaked wipe and place it in the BSC

## First wash to recover additional cells:

  1. Cells were not neutralised.
  2. 15 mL of Poloxamer 188/dPBS solution was added to the flask using a serological pipet - wash down the insides to wash any stuck microcarriers back into the bulk suspension.
  3. Allow the microcarriers to settle for at least 2 minutes
  4. Gently tilt the flask to an angle of approximately 30 degrees from vertical
  5. The cap was removed and 5mL of supernatant was discarded in the waste media bottle.

After discussing with Tom, the harvest was halted due to the lack of cells on
microcarriers as evidenced by the images as well as the fact that "cell
suspension" was discarded in the waste. It was discussed that the poloxamer
faciliated harvest will be reattempted tomorrow using the E250 flask
equilibrated today with fresh carriers and growth media. Cells will be
provided by Kylie, discussed with Nathan about overseeding flask tomorrow,
doing a sample and stain tomorrow evening or Friday morning and then
subsequently harvesting on Friday.

Observations/Summary:

As mentioned previously, images of the Hoescht stained carriers revealed that
there was a significant lack of cells on sampled carriers. Discussed with
Nathan about the reasons underlying this phenomena.

Possible reasons include:

\- Cells were never seeded onto carriers in the first place

\- Living cells detached

\- Cells died and detached naturally

It was discussed that all of these scenarios could either be due to the
poloxamer (although previous harvests with poloxamer have not shown that this
is the case - Nathan to confirm) or rather that the microcarriers had been
equilibrating in the incubator for just over a week.

### Results:

  * Results were;
    * [ ]  As Usual (this is a repetitive task)
    * [X]  Unexpected because carriers were revealed to have very very little cells on them.
    * [ ]  Need to be further analysed
    * [ ]  Other (.......)
