### Process:

  1. Took images of vessel on phase on the Zaber.
  2. Aliquotted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath for a minimum of 20 minutes prior to use:

TrypLE:     3x 2    mL in      3   tubes

 dPBS (for washing):     3 x 4mL    mL

Growth media (for seeding):     3 x 4mL

Time that all aliquots were placed in the water bath the warm before use
12:01 pm

Note: if aliquots were placed in water bath at different time, record the time
stamp for each individual solution.

  

  1. Added 150uL/well of Growth Media to 3 x 96-well plates matching destination plate format (only filling wells that will contain cells soon). Placed plates in incubator 11:10 am
  2. 




Plates 1&2  

4\. Removed vessel(s) from the incubator     12:11 pm

5\. Washed the vessel(s) with dPBS (warmed) (40uL/well).

6\. Added    20uL/well tryple and incubated at 37˚C.

  1. Start/Finish for TrypLE was  
  2.   P1: 12:37 - 12:57 pm  
P2: 12:42 - 1:02 pm pm  

7\. Neutralised with      50uL/well of Growth Media

8\. Transferred cell suspension from each source well to the corresponding
destination well in 96-well plates.

Placed back in incubator at 37C, 5% CO2   13:27 pm

    2. P4: 13:52 - 14:12  

7\. Neutralised with      50uL/well of Growth Media

8\. Transferred cell suspension from each source well to the corresponding
destination well in 96-well plates.

Placed back in incubator at 37C, 5% CO2   14:58 pm

8\. Transferred cell suspension from each source well to the corresponding
destination well in 96-well plates.

Placed back in incubator at 37C, 5% CO2   not recorded
