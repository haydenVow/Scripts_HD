## Performed by: Bonnie Tangey




Note: Culture 10518 was discarded without passaging as we don't need that many
cells.  
After passaging, these cultures were handed onto Lily for cloning related
experiments

### Process:

  1. Aliquotted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath for a minimum of 20 minutes prior to use
  2. Removed vessel(s) from the incubator
  3. Washed the vessel(s) with dPBS (warmed).
  4. Added    10    mL tryple to each vessel/well and incubated at 37˚C.
  5. Neutralised with    10      dPBS and combined cell suspension into      50ml   tubes.
  6. Centrifuged at 300 x g for 5 min.
  7. Aspirated the supernatant(s).
  8. Resuspended each pellet(s) in      2.5 mL     DMEM/F12 + 5% FBS media.  

  9. Took 500ul from each cell suspension, and transfered to T175s containing 30mL pre-warmed growth media.   

  10. Transferred vessel(s) to incubate at:   
37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)  
Incubator #138, Library Lab  
  




Observations/Summary:  
  
1:5 split, remaining cells discarded.
