Process:

1\. Retrieved   48 mL  of  E6 Media from a 90 mL shared gains and chains
aliquot in   1x 120 mL  pot from the biomaterials fridge.  
  
2\. Aliquots placed in water bath 11:30  

3\. Removed  100% of supernatant from vessel.

4\. Replaced with  2mL (per well/per vessel) of   E6 diff media.

5\. Returned vessels to incubate and connected the test hooks back up to the
electrode pins on the culture dish lid FOR PLATE 1 (7750) ONLY so that each
set of hooks connects to the corresponding wire colour and so that the black
hooks are aligned on the left side of each well and the red hooks on the right
(see wiring setup reference image below)   12:11
