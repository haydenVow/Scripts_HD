Procedure



Fixing & Staining ( ~ 45-50min)

  1. Phase image all wells using miacapture.
  2. Removed media from each well and gently wash twice with 200uL PBS. Time stamp: 11:55
  3. Added 100uL/well PFA for 15 min. Time stamp: 11:58 - 11:13  

  4. Removed PFA (and add in PFA waste container) and wash wells with 100uL PBS for 5 mins. 12:18 - 12:23
  5. Stain cells with 100uL DAPI (diluted 1:1000 in dPBS) for 5 mins. Timestamp: 12:26 - 12:31 (3mL dPBS + 3uL DAPI)  

  6. Wash cells three times with 100uL dPBS for 5 mins each. Timestamps:  
1\. 12:33-12:38  
2\. 12:40-12:45  
3\. 12:47-12:52

  7. Remove last wash and Add 100uL dPBS per well
  8. Image cells using the Zaber for DAPI
  9. Parafilm plate and cover with al-foil and store in small fridge in production  lab.

# Procedure

  1. Turn on the water bath and set to 37'C.
  2. Aliquot  required growth media into a sterile container/s and place into the water bath.
  3. Place in the water bath and heat for at least 20 minutes.
  4. Observe the cell flasks for confluence under the microscope using 4 x magnification and take images as required. Note: The confluence of cells must be <50% to perform cell feeding in P1-P3 and <80% in P4 prior to the cell differentiation stage. 
  5. Transfer flasks to the BSC and remove required volume of media from each flask (according to the Table above).
  6. Replace the same volume into each flask with the prepared growth media.
  7. Return the flasks to the incubator.
