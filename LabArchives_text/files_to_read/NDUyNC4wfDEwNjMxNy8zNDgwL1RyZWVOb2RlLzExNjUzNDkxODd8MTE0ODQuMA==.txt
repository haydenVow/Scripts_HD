Growth Media:

  * [x]  DMEM/F12 + 10% FBS + 1X P/S




### Process:  

3\. Aliquoted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then
placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath for a minimum of 20 minutes
prior to use: time

  1. TrypLE:    10    mL in     1 x 15mL Falcon Tube  tub
  2.  dPBS (for washing and neutralising):    10mL    mL 
  3. dPBS (for neutralising):    10mL    mL
  4. Growth media (for pellet resuspension):   5   mL 
  5. Growth media (for seeding):  240 mL.

Time that all aliquots were placed in the water bath the warm before use
timestamp 17:51

Note: if aliquots were placed in water bath at different time, record the time
stamp for each individual solution.




4\. Removed vessel(s) from the incubator

5\. Washed the vessel(s) with dPBS (warmed).

6\. Added    10   mL tryple to each vessel/well and incubated at 37ËšC.

  1. Start/Finish for TrypLE was   time 18:06 - 18:24  

7\. Neutralised with    10 mL   dPBS and combined cell suspension.

8\. Centrifuged at 650 x g for 5 min.

  1. Start/Finish time for centrifugation was   time 18:27  




9\. Aspirated the supernatant(s).

10\. Resuspended pellet(s) in    7   mL       growth   media

11\. Aliquoted     2 X 10 Ul    of resuspended cells into a microcentrifuge
tube for cell count.

12\. Performed a cell count using the haemocytometer and recorded the cell
count data in the Google Doc spreadsheet called 'Cell Count Spreadsheet' (see
link below):

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1DPzKubYxfHmWogVPihC-
SSIBtIylyrBQE5kRX5Z8NtI/edit#gid=0

  1. Total cell number was:    9,338,000      

  2. Volume of cell suspension required for subculture was:       used all - 7mL    

  3. Cell density per vessel:   APPROX 6700/cm     

13\. Added cell suspension into 240mL of growth media.

14\. Seeded 8 x T175 by adding 30 mL of resuspended cells in media into each
T175

15\. Placed in incubator at 7:18 pm (Library - top binder)

### Observations/Summary:

cells very confluent (90%)

many dead cells (round) floating in suspension

Passaged cells and obtained ~9.3M cells. More than expected. Seeded 8 x T175
at a lower seeding desnity of ~6700K cells/cm2




### Results

  * Results were;
    * [x]  As Usual (this is a repetitive task)
    * [ ]  Unexpected because...
    * [ ]  Need to be further analysed
    * [ ]  Other (.......)
