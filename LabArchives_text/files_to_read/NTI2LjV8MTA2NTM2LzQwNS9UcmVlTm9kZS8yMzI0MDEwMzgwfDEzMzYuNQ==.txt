# Procedure - Feed

# Note: Fibroblasts do NOT require Gelatin coated Flasks, and do NOT require
p38i.  

  1. Turn on the water bath and set to 37'C.
  2. Aliquot required growth media into a sterile container/s and place into the water bath. 
  3. Place in the water bath and heat for at least 20 minutes.
  4. Observe the cell flasks for confluence under the microscope using 4 x magnification and take images as required. 
  5. Transfer flasks to the BSC and remove required volume of media from each flask (according to the Table below).
  6. Replace the same volume into each flask with the prepared growth media.
  7. Return the flasks to the incubators

  
* Roller Bottles (R850) require 200mL for a 100% change and 100mL for a 50% change

Procedure - Treatment

  1. Turn on the water bath and set to 37'C.
  2. Aliquot  required growth media into a sterile container/s and add:  
    i) Vitamin C (aka LAA2P) [stock concentration 100mg/mL] to a working concentration of 50ug/mL in growth media i.e. 500uL per 1L of media.
  3. Place in the water bath and heat for at least 20 minutes.
  4. Observe the cell flasks for confluence under the microscope using 4 x magnification and take images as required. 
  5. Transfer flasks to the BSC and remove required volume of media from each flask (according to the Table below).
  6. Replace the same volume into each flask with the prepared growth media.
  7. Return the flasks to the incubator.

Due to accidently conducting a 50% feed on half the flasks, it was decided to
do 50% media change by pouring out all media and changing 50%, then adding the
required amount of treatment to this before adding back into the flask.  
  
This was done for both sets.


Set 1 - Vit C Treatment (3x10CS) - 50% media change with VitC (50ug/mL)


Note: 7979 had a 100% media change with Vit C treatment.


Set 2 - TGF pre-treatment (3x10CS + 1x2CF) - 50% media change with TGF-b (10ng/mL)
