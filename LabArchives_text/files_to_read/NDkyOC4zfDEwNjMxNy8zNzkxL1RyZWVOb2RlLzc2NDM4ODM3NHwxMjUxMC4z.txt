RELATED TO MILESTONE:  Generate at least 1 suspension-adapted fibroblast cell
line which >95% viable and proliferates for >14 days

AIM/PURPOSE: To test the effect of different media formulations on suspension
adaptation of 2 adherent clones (DOLLY12_11E7 muscle clone and F_DOLLY12_4C4
fibroblast clone).

HYPOTHESIS:

Both clones will be able to adapt to suspension in at least 1 of the media
conditions below.

Each condition includes 1:100 v/v Pen/Strep, 1:100 anti-clumping agent, 0.1%
P188, and 100 ng/mL of FGF, IGF1-LR3 and PDGF with either:

  * RPMI + 5% FBS
  * RPMI + 20% KSR
  * CD-CHO + 5% FBS
  * CD-CHO + 20% KSR

RESULTS SUMMARY:

The hypothesis was not supported.

None of the clones adapted to suspension in any of the media formulations
tested over a 40 day period. Although not statistically significant, we
observed higher cell counts in conditions containing 20% KSR than conditions
containing 5% FBS.

CONCLUSIONS:

The DOLLY12_11E7 clone and F_DOLLY12_4C4 clone are not able to adapt to
suspension in the media tested.

NEXT STEPS:

  * Attempt fast adaptation with heterogenous CHOMP cells to test how these cells behave in different media formulations in suspension (see EPIC26167)
  * Perform single cell cloning with CHOMP cells to see how they behave as single cells
  * Develop a high-throughput suspension single cell cloning pipeline by using OT2 (see EPIC27212)
