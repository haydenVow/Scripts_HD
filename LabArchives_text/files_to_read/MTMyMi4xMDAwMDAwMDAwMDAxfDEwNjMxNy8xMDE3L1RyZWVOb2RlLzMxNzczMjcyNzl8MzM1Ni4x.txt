Stained and imaged cells adhered to microcarriers

  1. Removed culture(s) from the incubator and placed them in the BSC  `| 10:26 am/pm|`
  2. Swirled culture(s) by hand on the flat surface of the BSC for 5 seconds, the lid was quickly removed and a 20uL sample of the suspension was taken while the liquid was still in motion. This ensures the carriers were evenly mixed at time of sampling.
  3. Transferred the aliquot(s) to a well on a 96 well plate. This was done for 3 samples per E125 flask.
    1. Row E: culture #6673 (serum)
    2. Row F: culture #6674 (E89C)
    3. Row G: culture #6675 (E810C)
    4. Row H: culture #6676 (E811B)
    5. columns 7, 8 and 9 were used for replicates
  4. Returned cultures to the incubator  `| 10:33 am/pm|`
  5. Mixed samples with 80 uL of dPBS containing 20uL/mL of Hoechst 33342. 
  6. Left the 96 well plate to incubate at room temperature, in the dark (away from light), for 12 minutes.  `| 10:36 - 10:48 am/pm |`
  7. the 96 wp was parafilmed and stored in the fridge. ~11:10 
    1. Plates were not imaged immediately as we were resolving Zaber issues
  8. Plates were imaged on the main lab Zaber on 5x. ~12:25
    1. Phase: illuminator lamp ~1, exposure 10. Histogram: 0-90
    2. DAPI: illuminator lamp ~35, exposure 35. Histogram: 0-180
    3. images captured under culture ID: 6702
