Process:  

1\. Placed  25 mL  mL of new Growth Medium into the water bath   15:25  

2\. Placed shake tubes in centrifuge and centrifuge at 300 x g for 5 min at
RT.   15:27 - 15:32  

3\. Aspirated supernatant from each pellet. Re-suspended pellets in 10 mL each
of dPBS. Took 500 uL of sample from each culture for staining procedure trial
(see entry below this one for staining entry)

4\. Re-centrifuged cultures at 300 x g for 5 min at RT. Timestamp: 15:45 -
15:50

5\. Aspirated dPBS

6\. Added 1 mL of new Growth Medium to each tube and used a P1000 pipette to
break up cell clumps.

7\. 20 uL of each culture taken and cell count performed (see cell count
spreadsheet here: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1DPzKubYxfHmWogVPihC-
SSIBtIylyrBQE5kRX5Z8NtI/edit#gid=1526857572)

8\. Pellets combined in remaining 21 mL of warmed medium (to make up to 25 mL
total) and triturated with 10 mL serological pipette to break up cell clumps
and resuspend evenly

9\. Returned 4 x vessel to incubate at: 16:20 Shaking at 130 RPM

  * [X]  37ÂºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * Incubator (#68 - in clamp on shaker), Lab [Library]



  1. Syringe filtered 5 mL of PBS into a 15 mL tube. Use this for the following steps:
    1. Prepared 1 mL of staining solution by adding 5 uL of PI and 20 uL of Hoescht in PBS
  2. Added 100 uL/well of the staining solution to 8 wells of 96 wp. (A1-A4, B1-B4)
  3. From the 500 uL samples taken in entry above, take 10 uL and add them to wells of 96 well plate containing 100 uL of the staining solutions (duplicates for each culture).
  4. Incubated for 20 min 16:04 - 16:24
  5. Centrifuged plate at 650 g for 1 min
  6. Imaged on the Main Lab Zaber under culture ID 7383 on 5x magnification. Took images of the centre of each well as well as the whole well.
    1. Exposure for Hoescht: 70. Exposure for PI: 250.

Observations:

Cells in culture 7221 overall looked the best morphologically and had the
highest count - supports previous counts and viability checks

Better Hoechst staining achieved than on Tues, still need to optimised focus -
one plane was in focus for some wells and out of focus for others
