In House: Set 6 - 5x10CS Harvest & E-Flask Seed + Treatment TGFb + VitC


Experiment Plan:




Procedure - Harvest

### Cell Harvest

  1. Turn on water bath and set temperature to 37C.
  2. Take the flasks for harvest and observe under the microscope at 4x objective for even cell distribution . Refer to VSOP-006. Take 2-3 images per flask.
  3. Aliquot required volume of dPBS (37C), dPBS (ambient temp) and TrypLE in separate sterile pots.  Refer to Table below for required volume.
  4. Place aliquots in pre-warmed water bath and leave for ~20 minutes or until warmed. Note: Ensure TrypLE is thoroughly warmed.
  5. Transfer aliquots and flasks required for harvest into the BSC.
  6. Collect growth media and loose aggregates from each flask.
  7. Wash with warmed dPBS, then collect this also.
  8. Add TrypLE to each of the flasks. Mix thoroughly to ensure coverage of the surface area.
  9. Place in the incubator at 37C. After 10 minutes, remove flasks and observe for 95-100% dissociation of cells. Incubate further until maximum dissociation level is reached.  
     NOTE: The flasks must be removed from the incubator within 18 minutes of initial incubation of TrypLE containing flasks
  10. Aspirate the TrypLE solution and collect into 250mL centrifuge tubes.
  11. Add ambient temperature dPBS to each flask as a final wash. To effectively remove remaining cells adhered to the flasks, mix thoroughly and then pour the dPBS into 250mL centrifuge tubes.
  12. Centrifuge at 700 x g for 5 minutes.````
  13. Meanwhile remove aggregates from collected growth media and dPBS via carefully aspiration with a serological pipette and place them into a 250mL centrifuge tube.
  14. Centrifuge this also at 700 x g for 5 minutes.
  15. Gently remove centrifuge tubes from the machine, ensuring not to disturb the cell pellets. Aspirate as much supernatant as possible from the tubes. Discard supernatant. Remove as much remaining supernatant with a 1mL pipette.

### Cell Count

  1. Following cell harvest and centrifugation, re-suspend the cell pellets. Use the table below to provide a rough estimation of the resuspension volume required.
  2. Perform cell count (Refer to VSOP-007) and enter details into Prodction Cell Count Calculator: VBLT001

### Re-pellet and Weigh Final Yield

  1. Label and Record the weight of 1 sterile centrifuge tube and set aside. Record details in Widget.  
  2. Add growth media to each centrifuge tube and resuspend cells. Refer to the table below for the required amount of growth media to be added.
  3. Combine all resuspended cells into the weighed centrifuge tube. 
  4. Wash all empty centrifuge tubes with growth media and add this to the centrifuge tube containing the resuspended cells. 
  5. Centrifuge at 700 x g x 5 minutes. 
  6. Aspirate the supernatant from the tube. Remove as much remaining supernatant with a 1mL pipette.
  7. Record the final weight of the cell pellet. Enter details in Widget. 
  8. Following this resuspend the cells in media ready to be seeded into E250 flasks.

Procedure - Treatment

  1. Turn on the water bath and set to 37'C.
  2. Aliquot  required growth media into a sterile container/s and add:  
                                 i) Set 6: Treatment 1: Vitamin C (aka LAA2P) [stock concentration 100mg/mL] to a working concentration of 50ug/mL \+ TGF-b1 [stock concentration 0.002mg/L] to a working concentration of 10ng/mL                                                     ii) Set 6: Treatment 2: Vitamin C (aka LAA2P) [stock concentration 100mg/mL] to a working concentration of 5mg/mL \+ TGF-b1 [stock concentration 0.002mg/L] to a working concentration of 10ng/mL 
  3. Place in the water bath and heat for at least 20 minutes.
  4. Meanwhile, set up the shaker platform and set to 100rpm. 
  5. Transfer the treated media back into the BSC and add the desired concentration of cells to each aliquot
  6. Transfer flasks to the BSC and seed them with the cell-containing, treated media.
  7. Return the flask/s to the incubator on the shaker platform.

The pellet was destined to be split equally between all of the 18x E250
flasks. This means that in each flask the pellet weight should be equal to the
"Food Weight" value (in the table above)/18.

i.e.

12.053 g / 18 E250 flasks = 0.670 grams per flask




* For Cell Count 2: Dilution factor = 20

Seeding Note:  
Cells seeded at 3.5M/mL = 142M/flask

Seed and Treatment were performed at the same time:

  1. Treatment and cells added to media at the required amount
  2. This was then added to the E250 flasks at the correct volume 

  

Note: The cell suspension was added to the two pre-prepared media aliquots
which contained the TGF-b and Vitamin C (50 ug/mL or 5 mg/mL). The cell
suspension was added to each media aliquot by first adding 50 mL cells to each
media aliquot, then 49 mL cells was added to the 50ug/mL media and then the
remaining volume (which should have been 49 mL) to the 5 mg/mL aliquot.
However, only 43 mL of the cells was available for this final addition step,
meaning that the 5 mg/mL sample was 6 mL short of cells (less cells overall
therefore).
