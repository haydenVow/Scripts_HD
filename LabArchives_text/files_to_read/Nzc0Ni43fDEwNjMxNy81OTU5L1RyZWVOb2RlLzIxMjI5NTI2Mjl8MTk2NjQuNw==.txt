## Completed by: Bec/Alex


Aim/Purpose


To train Alex Ward & allow him to feel comfortable with Airtable, Retool &
LabArchvies as well as Vow's processes of thawing MuSCs, feeding MuSCs and
harvesting MuSCs.


Hypothesis


That training Alex on the above-mentioned techniques will allow him to be
comfortable and autonomous in performing these tasks as well as maintaining
high quality record keeping on Vow's systems.

Method/Procedure


  1. [Experiment Plan]
    1. Prepare DMEM/F12 + 20% FBS + 1X P/S Growth Media for this experiment
    2. Thaw BUFFY6 WCB cells into 2 x T175 flasks [Monday 20 Dec]
    3. Gelatin-coat 1 x 96-well plate (2 columns) and fill the rest of the plate with dPBS (200uL/well) [Tuesday 21 Dec]
    4. Harvest cells, seed into 96-well plates at 10,000 cells / well [Tuesday 21 Dec]
    5. Prepare E6 and 2% HS differentiation media [Tuesday 21 Dec]
    6. Change media to differentiation media (200uL/well) [Wednesday 22 Dec]
    7. Allow plates to incubate at 37ÂºC & 5% CO2 for 14 days
    8. Fix plates [Wednesday 5 January 2022]
    9. Stain samples for Phalloidin (1:1000 dilution for 20 minutes)
    10. Image wells on Zaber
    11. Assess actin intensity in cells, and determine whether the media contributes to a significant difference in actin production.
