Plan


1\. Determine 5 biomaterial candidates to test

2\. Determine 3 different concentrations of each biomaterial to test

3\. Make up biomaterial sols

4\. Make 2cm square grid and sheet

5\. Crosslink/set grid and sheet

6\. Wash in chicken stock

7\. Taste test. Test for tooth feel, taste, stretch.

Notes:

\- If using citric acid as a crosslinker, it is important to incorporate it
into the water phase prior to the addition of the hydrogel powder. Once the
hydrogel has hydrated, form into a scaffold and bake in an oven.

\- Carrageenan showed moderate levels of syneresis even with the addition of
locust bean gum (1.5%). This component may need to be increased in
concentration.
