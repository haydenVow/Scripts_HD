Process:

1\. Aliquotted   50mL  mL of  growth Media into   1x50mL    tube(s). Placed in
water bath   13:34 a/pm

2\. Removed  50  % of supernatant from E flask and 2x T175 flasks (see IDs
above)

3\. Replaced with  15 mL (per well/per vessel) of  growth   media.

4\. Inspected both T175 plates down the 4x objective on the primovert and took
2 photos of each flask to track cell morphology.

5\. Returned vessel to incubate at: [14:10] (suspension culture was returned
to shake at 120 rpm instead of 85)

  * [x]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (aviary cells)

  

  * Incubator #67

Inspected culture 6597 under the 4x objective on the Primovert, captured
images of each well (6 total). Had some issues with the images not showing up
in MIA capture. Repeated the imaging process for the T flasks (see step 4
above) and found the same occurance of images not showing up in MIA capture.
Consulted with Stanley over the radio. He mentioned there was a backlog in
uploading images to our storage cloud due to a backlog of Zaber images. This
should resolve normally and the images should appear.  

Determined that the wells in the 96 well plate examined were 100% confluent so
a switch to Diff media was required.

  1. Aliquoted out 40mL of 2% HS Diff media and E6 media from the main lab and brought the aliquots into the library lab.
  2. [14:55] Aspirated 100% of the media from the wells of all 96 well plates and replaced media in the top row (Row B) with E6 media (150uL) and the bottom row (Row C) with 2% horse serum Diff media (150ul).
  3. Returned the plates to incubate at [15:05]

Stored the remaining 2% HS media and E6 media aliquoted in fridge #104 in the
library lab.




### Observations/Summary:

  * Switched the diff plates to their respective DIff medias today.
  * Cells in the T175 flasks do not appear very confluent (~5% confluent).
  * Images were not appearing in MIA capture despite aquiring the images twice. Consulted Stanley who assured that the images will appear once blockages in image processing have been cleared.
