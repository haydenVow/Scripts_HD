### Process:

  1. Removed flask(s)/plate(s) `culture IDs:` 6679, 6677

  2. Used sterile tweezers to carefully transfer `the` scaffold pieces to separate wells in the same format on a 96 well plate.

  3. Washed the pieces on the 96 well plate 2 times in 230 ul of PBS for  `5`  minutes at room temperature.

    1. 15:21 - 15:26
    2. `15:30-15:35`
  4. Added   230 uL of 4% PFA to each scaffold and incubate for  `15`  min at room temperature.  `15:39 - 15:55`

  5. Rewashed with PBS 15:58 - 16:03  
  

  6. Aspirate PBS and stain the pieces with 200 uL of DAPI in PBS (1:1000) (17 x 200 ul = 3400 ul -> 3.4 ul of DAPI required)  
  
for 5 minutes in the dark. `16:06 - 16:11  
`

  7. Wash the pieces 2 times for   5   `minutes in` 200 ul of PBS.

    1. `16:14 - 16:20`
    2. `16:23 - 16:28`
  8. Aspirate the PBS and leave the scaffold pieces just covered by fresh PBS. 16:35

`label the plate halves with the respective culture IDs and date of fixing
and/or staining`

  

Placed in the biomaterials fridge. 16:40

  

Observations

Fungal contamination in well plate 6677 G10 Serum Cell Free Control. White
fluffy appearance. Slimy feel with tweezers. Surrounded the sample and present
in the rest of the well.  
10x and 5x microscopy images indicate fungal contamination:

Plate 6677

JB -  Just one well appeared contaminated. All samples were moved to a new
plate to be fixed so that any cells on the bottom of the well weren't stained
and imaged. The original plate was then parafilmed and placed it in the yellow
biosafety bin for disposal. All samples were fixed and killed on this time
point, contamination was contained.
