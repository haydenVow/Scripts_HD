## Performed by: Shaleen (Fix)  




Reagent preparation:

Use the following spreadsheet to:

  * Determine the total amount of regent required for primary staining
  * Provide more information on antibody types

1\. Prepared    10mL  PBST (0.2% Triton-X)

2\. Prepared   6 mL  blocking buffer: PBST (0.1% Triton-X + PBS) + 3% bovine
serum albumin (BSA). (Kept in the fridge until needed in blocking step)

3\. Prepared Primary Antibody Mix: :  7.5 µL   Primary #1 MyoG (Santa Cruz)
(1:200  ) +  30 µL   Primary #2 MF20 (DSHB)   (1:50  ) +  1.46  mL Blocking
Buffer

Pipette-mixed antibody mix and stored refrigerated away from light until
needed.

Process:

Fixing

  1. Removed Plate 7237 from the incubator (78) 
  2. Removed media from each well and washed with 100uL of PBS. 
  3.  Added  200 µL of 4% PFA to each well for 15 min:  13:53 - 14:08 pm 
  4. Removed PFA (and add in PFA waste container) and wash wells with   200 µL PBS. 
  5. Placed fixed plate in Fixing and Staining fridge in Main Lab.
  6. Removed Plates 7236 and 7235 from fridge 65. 

  

Permeabilise

1\. Removed PBS from each well across all three plates.

2\. Added  100 µL PBST (0.2% Triton-X) to each well for 15 min:  15:04 - 15:19

3\. Aspirated PBST for each well.




Blocking

1\. Added  100 µL of blocking buffer (3% BSA in PBST [0.1% Triton-X]) and
incubate for 45 minutes - 1hr at RT. (no more than 1 hour):   15:25 - 16:15




Single/Simultaneous Primary Antibody staining

1\. Removed blocking buffer from each well.

2\. Incubated cells with 50uL primary antibody ~~for 90min - 2hrs at RT, or~~
4ºC overnight:   16:30

3\. Parafilmed plates and stored at 4ºC in tissue culture lab Fridge.    16:30

After this step, all further task should be performed in a dark room. The
vessel should also be wrapped foil when not used.
