Process:

  1. The 'E6' storage plates were placed in the incubator to warm media. 13:34-14:02
  2. 5% was media (70uL/well) was slowly aspirated from 1 column before adding 70uL/well of media from the corresponding 'E6' storage plate. i.e. media from column 1 of 'E6' plate 1 into column 1 of culture plate 1 and so on. This was performed for all columns of all 3 plates. Tips were changed in between columns. The 'E6' storage plates were then sealed with an adhesive sealing mat and placed in fridge (4 degrees C). 
  3. Returned vessel to incubate at: 14:39
