Performed by Bonnie Tangey

NOTE: This staining was performed following the staining of trial #2
suspension cultures. Because the CDMA staining did not show up clearly, and
because the PI staining was performed at a low concentration, I decided to
trial these cultures with Hoechst instead of CDMA and with a higher
concentration of PI.

Process:  

1\. Place the pre-aliquotted  10 mL  mL of each respective type of Growth
Media into the water bath   17:30

2\. Placed shake tubes in centrifuge and centrifuge at 650 x g for 5 min at
RT.   17:45

3\. Aspirated supernatant from each pellet

4\. Added 1mL of respective growth media to each tube and used a P1000 pipette
to break up cell clumps.

5\. 20uL of each culture taken for viability check + additional 20uL to trial
live dead staining on culture 7221

6\. Remaining 9mL of each respective media was added afterwards and triturated
with 10mL serological pipette to break up cell clumps for each culture further
and resuspend cells evenly.

4\. Returned 4 x vessel to incubate at:   17:15 pm Shaking at 206 RPM

  * [X ]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * Incubator (#67 ), Lab [Library]




HOECHST/ PI STAINING of culture 7221

  1. Prepared Hoechst solution by adding 20ul of Hoechst to 1mL of DMEM/F12
  2. Took 10ul sample of cell suspension collected in the previous step and resuspend the cells in in 200ul of Hoechst solution. 
  3. Incubated 10 minutes under culture conditions.
  4. While incubating, created 2 μg/mL Propidium Iodide (PI) working solution in DMEM/F12 (10ul in 1ml)
  5. After 30 minutes, added 200ul PI solution (giving final concentration of 1ug/ml) and mixed well.
  6. Incubated in PI for 5 min
  7. Dispensed cells onto haemocytometer slide for counting.
  8. Observed under fluorescence microscopy/ perform cell counts and extrapolate live/dead cell count for each culture.

Observations:

I could not easily visualise the Hoechst or Dapi staining on the Axio
microscope. I did manage to capture one set of images (shown below) however I
could not get any further images as the fluoresce was not appearing through
the microscope or camera.




Images: Hoechst/ PI staining

Image: A: Culture 7221 cells stained with Hoechst (A) and PI (B). Fluorescence
images taken at 10x magnification on channels 461 (Hoechst) and 555 (PI) in
the same field of view. Note that brightness and contrast has been adjusted
using ImageJ.
