4\. Removed vessel(s) from the incubator  16:10  

5\. Washed the vessel(s) with dPBS.

6\. Added  1  mL tryple to each vessel/well and incubated at 37ËšC.

  1. Start/Finish for TrypLE was  16:15  \- 16:31.   

7\. Neutralised with    4 mL   growth media and combined cell suspension into
a  15 mL tube

8\. mixed well and took 11uL sample for cell count. Performed a cell count
using the haemocytometer and recorded the cell count data in the Google Doc
spreadsheet: Cell Count Spreadsheet or cell count widget below

  1. Total cell number was:
    1. 4C4:     260,000  cells     

9\. Centrifuged at 650 x g for 5 min.

10\. aspirated supernatant and added 450uL growth media.  Mixed well via
pipetting up and down

11\. added 50uL cryostor gently, mixed gently via pipetting, and added to
cryovial

12\.  placed in -80 in a mr frosty
