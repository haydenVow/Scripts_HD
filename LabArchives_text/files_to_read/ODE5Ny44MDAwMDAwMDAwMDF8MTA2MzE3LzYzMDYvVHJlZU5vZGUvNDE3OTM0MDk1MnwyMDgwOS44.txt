Process

  1. Placed media in water bath or incubator 10:35
  2. Collected E125s from shaker, wiped with ethanol-sprayed Rediwipe, and brought into BSC
  3. Using a 25 mL serelogical pipette, gently pipette-mixed culture to break up cell clumps
  4. Transfer suspension into 50 mL tubes. Kept E125 vessels in BSC, as culture will be returned to these vessels after feed. 
  5. Centrifuged 50 mL tubes at 300 x g for 5 min. While cultures were centrifuging, rinsed each E125 with sterile dPBS. 
  6. Aspirated 15 mL  of supernatant, taking extra care to not disrupt or aspirate pellet 
  7. Added  15 mL of fresh, warmed growth media to each 50 mL tube
  8. Gently pipette-mixed cultures using serological, before moving cell suspension back to E125s
  9. Returned E125s to incubator 12:17
