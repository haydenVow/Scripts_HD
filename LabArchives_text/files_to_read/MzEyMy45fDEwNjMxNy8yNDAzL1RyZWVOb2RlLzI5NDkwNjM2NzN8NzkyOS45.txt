Process:

1\. on D0, remove 5.3 skin biopsy from storage media (DMEM+P/S stored in
fridge)  

2\. using sterile scissors or scalpel, cut into 6 pieces.  Set 3 pieces aside
for freezing and cut the remaining 3 pieces into 0.5cm chunks.  

3\. place chunks in tissue cultured plates, dissociate further using
scalpel/scissors and JUST cover with growth media, allowing tissue to stay on
the bottom of the dish  

4\. place in incubator

5\. monitor for outgrowth and contamination daily

6\. top with additional growth media on D2

7\. change media on D4 and continue to feed until outgrowth is confluent, then
passage using tryple
