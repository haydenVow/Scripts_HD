Clones on culture 13043 were passaged by hand.  
  
Briefly.

  1. Cultures were imaged using the Primovert microscope under 5x objective, PHASE imaging. Images were inspected manually for a confluence estimate. Wells that appeared to have >90% confluence were selected for continuous passaging https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1yQD_JrhzktpQd0vaCt2B5OskKgl9SipLLab3WZ9v7ZU/edit#gid=1517361241&range=253:255
  2. Media was aspirated from these wells
  3. Wells were washed with 1mL of dPBS 
  4. Wash was removed and cells were covered with 200uL of Tryple. 
  5. Cells were left to incubate for 10-12 minutes at 30 degrees, 5% CO2. 
  6. Tryple volume from each well was then transferred to a new well containing 3mL of growth media on a new 6 well plate (DMEM/F12 + 20% FBS + 1xP/S).
  7. The new culture was returned to incubator 140 (culture 13136).
