Took samples

  1. Sprayed down the sample line end with 70% ethanol.
  2. Connected a 5 mL sterile syringe.
  3. Withdrew 1 mL (first-draw)
  4. Disconnected sample syringe and transferred 1 mL of sample each to 1.5 mL Eppendorf tubes for cell count
  5. Connected a fresh sterile syringe and withdrew 1 mL of sample (second-draw).
  6. Disconnected sample syringe and transferred 1 mL of sample each to 1.5 mL Eppendorf tubes for cell count
  7. Sprayed sample line with 70% ethanol.
  8. Performed cell count:
    * 1st draw: 568,000 cells/mL
    * 2nd draw: 236,000 cells/mL
    * average: 402,000 cells/mL
  9. Checked stirring speed, temperature, pH, and dissolved oxygen and recorded in 'observation/summary' section below

NotesFirst draw had heaps more cells than the second draw, perhaps the first
draw had extra cells in there from a previous draw? I would probably consider
the second draw to be more accurate. Either way the cell numbers have still
increased since yesterday.  
No aggregation observed
