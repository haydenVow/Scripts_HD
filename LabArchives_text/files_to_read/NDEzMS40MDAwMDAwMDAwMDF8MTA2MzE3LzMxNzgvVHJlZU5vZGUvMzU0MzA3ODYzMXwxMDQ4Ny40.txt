Reagent preparation:

2\. Centrifuged the secondary antibody stock using the benchtop
microcentrifuge for 10 seconds.

3\. Prepared Secondary Antibody mix (pipette from the top/supernatant of
antibody solution):

  8 µL   Secondary #1   (1:1000  ) +  8 µL   Secondary #2   (1:1000  ) +  8
mL Blocking Buffer (PBST (0.1% Triton X + dPBS) + 3% BSA)  

If using AlexaFluor secondary antibodies then the max concentration should be
1:500 (typically used at 1:1000)

Pipette-mixed antibody mix and stored refrigerated away from light until
needed.

4\. Prepared DAPI mix:

   8 mL  PBS +   8 uL  of DAPI

Vortexed DAPI mix and stored refrigerated away from light until needed.

Process:

1\. Removed plate from fridge (incubated in primary antibodies overnight).

2\. Washed 3 times for 5 min with PBS at RT.

 16:05 - 16:10 pm

 16:11 - 16:16 pm

 16:17 - 16:22 pm

3\. Incubated the cells with secondary antibody mixture in the dark at RT for
1 hour.   16:22- 17:22 pm

NOTE: from this step onwards protect from the light by wrapping plates in foil
and perform experiment in the dark.




Counter staining

1\.  Removed 2nd antibody solution.  17:25 pm

2\.  Washed with DAPI (1:1000) in PBS for 5 min at RT in the dark.

 17:27 - 17:32 pm

3\.  Washed in PBS 3 x 5 min at RT in the dark. (No Triton)  

 17:32 - 17:37 pm

 17:38 - 17:43 pm

4\.  Replaced dPBS.

 17:44 pm

5\. Confirmed staining on microscope by imaging.
