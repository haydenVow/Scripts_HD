Process:

1\. Aliquotted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then
placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath for a minimum of 20 minutes
prior to use:

  1. TrypLE:    60   mL in  1 x 120 ml     tubes
  2. dPBS (for neutralising)   120 ml    mL in  1 x 120 ml   tubes
  3. Growth media (for pellet resuspension):   10   mL in    1 x 15 ml    tubes
  4. Growth media (for seeding):    360   mL in   1 x 500 ml     tubes
  5. Times that all aliquots were placed in the water bath to warm before use    14:50 - 15:10  pm 

Note: if aliquots were placed in water bath at different times, record the
time stamp for each individual solution.




2\. Washed the flask(s) with dPBS.

3\. Added   10    mL tryple to each vessel/well and incubated at 37˚C for   8
min.

Note: Fibroblasts typically require 15-18 minutes of incubation with tryple,
slightly longer than MuSCs.

  1. Start/Finish time for tryple was    15:36    \-    15:41   pm

4\. Neutralised with   10    dPBS (warmed) and combined cell suspension into
3 x 50 ml   tube.

5\. Centrifuged at 400 x g for 5 min

  1. Start/Finish time for centrifugation was    16:00    \-    16:05  a/pm 




6\. Aspirated the supernatant(s)

7\. Resuspended pellet(s) in     10   mL    Growth   media.

8\. Performed a cell count using the haemocytometer and recorded the cell
count data in widget or the Google Doc spreadsheet called 'Cell Count
Spreadsheet' (see link below):

9\. Total cell number was:   47 640 000  

10\. Seeded ~7k cells per cm2 of the flasks/plates. Note that fibroblasts
prefer to be subcultured closely together.

11\. Volume of cell suspension required for subculture was:   1.543 ml  

12\. Transfer   3.084 mL of cell suspension to the pre-warmed   1 x 500 mL
Growth Media.

13\. Transfer cell suspension into (non-gelatin coated)  12 x T175
flasks/plates.

14\. Transfer flask/plate(s) to incubate at:

  * [ ]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (aviary cells)
  * [X]  30ºC, 5% CO2 (reptilian cells)
