Process
  
  
  1. Took 2 x 50 uL aliquots from each of 2 x e-flask cultures (1 x freestyle, 1 x RPMI/HyCell) and performed 2 x cell counts
    * Freestyle ave count: 6,200,000  

    * RPMI/HyCell ave count: 7,080,000
  2. Transferred 8.47 mL (3,000,000 cells) from RPMI/HyCell flask to centrifuge tube.
  3. Centrifuged at 500 x g for 5 minutes 15:19
  4. While tube was centrifuging, discarded 6.8 mL (2,120,000 cells) from Freestyle flask.
  5. Added 8.47 mL RPMI/HyCell medium and 6.8 mL Freestyle medium to respective flask and returned to incubator
  6. Aspirated 100% of supernatant
  7. Re-suspended in 6 mL of sterile dPBS (want 10,000 cells per well, so need 50,000 cells per mL in enough volume to seed all wells)
  8. Set up OT2 deck with media-filled plates and cell suspension 
  9. Ran cell seeding protocol on OT2 
    1. Start time:
    2. Run time:
  10. Imaged plates on Zaber microscope (phase, 5X) and ran through ML model. Checked that wells received cells. 
  11. Moved plates to incubator at 37'C, 5%CO2 (incubator # , main/library/production lab)
