Reagent preparation:

Use the following spreadsheet to:

  * Determine the total amount of regent required for primary staining
  * Provide more information on antibody types

OR

  

Alternatively plug in your values and manually calculate: (note these volumes
are for primary and secondary staining + DAPI)

  

12wps

PBS:         (number of wells) x     mL (volume per well) =   mL  (If required
to make up PBST, then use: 13.5 mL PBS + 27 uL of Triton-X)

PBST (0.2% Triton-X) :    24   (number of wells) x    1 mL  (volume per well)
=   24 mL ( mL with excess)  (use this to make the 0.1% PBST for blocking
buffer)

Blocking buffer:     24    (number of wells) x    1 mL  (volume per well) =
24 mL  (4.5 mL 0.2% TX + 4.5 mL PBS + dissolve 0.27 g of BSA (3% by mass))

Note: blocking buffer is: PBST (0.1% Triton-X + PBS) + 3% bovine serum albumin
(BSA). Kept in the fridge until needed in blocking step

  

Total volumes required:

(If required to make PBST: Add 80 uL of TritonX to 40 mL PBS)

PBST = 24 mL + 3 mL = 27 mL

BB = 24 mL + 3 mL = 27 mL

  

  

Primary staining with MyoG and MF20

Total volume of BB + antibody required:

(24×0.4) = 9.6 mL (round to 11 mL)

 ~~Need to calculate volume required for 1:200 dilution: 11~~ ~~  / 200 = 55
uL (MyoG)~~

Need to calculate volume required for 1:50 dilution: 55 x 4 = 220 uL (MF20)  

  

Prepared Primary Antibody Mix: : ~~35 µL   Primary #1 MyoG (Santa Cruz)
(1:200  ) +~~   220 µL   Primary #2 MF20 (DSHB)   (1:50  ) +   10.78  mL
Blocking Buffer

Pipette-mixed antibody mix and stored refrigerated away from light until
needed.

  

Secondary staining with Ab (2 x 1:1000 dilution)  

11 / 1000 = 11 uL of each secondary Ab required

Volume of Phalloidin?

11 + X mL of BB required to dilute both SAbs

Process:

Permeabilise ( ~ 20 - 30 min)

1\. Removed PBS from each well.

2\. Added  1 mL for 12wp  PBST (0.2% Triton-X) to each well for 15 min:

Plate 8822  16:18 - 16:31  

Plate 8823  16:13 - 16:28

3\. Aspirated PBST for each well.

  




Blocking ( ~ 1 hr)

1\. Added   1 mL for 12wp µL of blocking buffer (3% BSA in PBST [0.1%
Triton-X]) and incubate for 45 minutes - 1hr at RT. (no more than 1 hour):

Plate 8822  16:35 - 17:20  

Plate 8823  16:39 - 17:24




Single/Simultaneous Primary Antibody staining ( ~ 10 minutes or 2hr)

1\. Removed blocking buffer from each well.

2\. Incubated cells with primary antibody for 90min - 2hrs at RT, or 4ºC
overnight:

Plate 9431  16:55 - :  

Plate 9432  17:10 - :

3\. Parafilmed plates and stored at 4ºC in tissue culture lab Fridge.

After this step, all further task should be performed in a dark room. The
vessel should also be wrapped foil when not used.




Observations/Summary:

### Both plates primary stained and ready for secondary staining.
