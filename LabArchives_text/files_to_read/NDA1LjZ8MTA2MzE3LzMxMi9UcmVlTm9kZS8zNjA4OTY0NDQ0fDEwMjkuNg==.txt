Equilibrate microcarriers in culture medium before use (SP:1)

  1. Mixed the stock microcarrier (20mg/mL) before aliquoting 6.8 mL into 1x 15 mL tube.  
  2. The microcarriers were then allowed to settle and the supernatant (3 mL) removed.  8.30 am
  3. The microcarriers were resuspended in 3 mL of growth media (DMEM/F12 + 20% FBS + 1x P/S + 10uM p38i).
  4. Allowed the microcarriers to settle once again.
  5. Resuspended microcarriers in 3 mL of growth media. Mixed and transferred this to 1x E125 flask.
  6. Added 3 mL of growth media to the 15x mL tube and transferred this to the E125 flask to take up any remaining microcarriers.
  7. Added 20 mL of growth media to the E125 flask to make the total volume 30 mL.
  8. The culture vessel was transferred to the incubator (bottom Sanyo - 37 degrees C, 5% CO2) so that the microcarriers and culture medium could equilibrate.  8:56 am`




Intermittent agitation to facilitate adhesion

  1. Transferred cell suspension containing `2.9 M million cells` in 1.343  `mL `to the equilibrated microcarrier suspension in the culture vessel.
    1. See lab book entry for harvest of cells:
  2. Transferred vessel to incubate at:
    1. [X]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
    2. [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (aviary cells)
  3. Began the seeding schedule for 6 hours (below) using the KASA app.
    1. The minimum required agitation speed for shaken cultures to maintain the microcarriers in suspension can be estimated using this calculator: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/18NrC_xaJ2I87B4x3vTE46Z-ZUS3EV0Gw-CnM0DcukL4/edit?usp=sharing
      * Shake speed used = 120 rpm  

    2. The seeding schedule may be reduced or extended by removing or adding 30 minute cycles as required. Generally, at least 3 but up to 12 hours are required to allow the maximum number of the inoculated cells to adhere.
      1. Started shaking at 16:31. The timer shaker was set to shake for 2 min, then stay static for 28 min. Then repeat. It was set to shake continuously from 10.31pm.
