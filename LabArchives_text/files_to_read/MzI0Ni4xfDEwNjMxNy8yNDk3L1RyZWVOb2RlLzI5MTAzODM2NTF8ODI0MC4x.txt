Plan for the preparation of Seitan:

Materials

Wheat flour:

  * 200 g all purpose flour 
  * 150 mL water

Wheat flour + gluten :

  * 150 g all purpose flour
  * 50g gluten
  * 150 mL water

Gluten:

  * 100g gluten
  * 200 mL water 

  

  * Additional water for heating 
  * Additional water for filling specimen jar 
  * Scalpel 
  * 3 x 500 - 1L beaker
  * Stirrer 
  * Tweezer 
  * 27 x Specimen jars 
  * large bowl 
  * scales 
  * measuring cylinder 
  * sieve or colander 
  * 100 mm culture plate

Method

  1. In a large bowl, combine  flour and water and knead 10 - 15 minutes until a smooth ball forms (it should spring back when you poke it )
  2. Repeat for  gluten and wheat + gluten samples
  3. For samples containing wheat flour, cover sample with cool water and leave to incubate at RT for 1 - 2 hours 
  4. Remove excess water and cover ball with fresh cold water 
  5. Knead in water to remove starch. When water is opaque and thickens, remove and replace with fresh water 
  6. repeat rinse until a spongey mass is obtained (dough should cling together well and water should be cloudy but not opaque)
  7.  squeeze out remaining water and allow seitan to rest in a colander to drain (20 - 30 minutes) 
  8. Weigh each sample
    1. Wheat flour: 85.3 g 
    2. What flour + gluten: 166 g
    3. Gluten: 253 g
  9. Separate out 6 x ~10 g pieces from each sample
  10. Knead sampled into one another to form "fibers"
  11. Divide seitan into 2 even pieces. further divide each piece into 9 pieces and form long strands. 
  12. Braid strands, then pull to stretch and form a large knot. (this process will form fibers similar to pulled chicken) - refer to image
  13. Fill beakers half way with water (500 mL) and heat at the following temperatures: 
    1.  70 degrees for 20 minutes, 40 minutes, 60 minutes, 80 minutes, 100 minutes
    2. 80 degrees for 20 minute, 40 minutes, 1hr
  14. Adjusted temp to 80 degrees C after the 10 minute mark
  15. Remove samples at given timepoints with a tweezer and transfer onto a 6 well plate
  16.  Allow to cool  (20 minutes), before cutting in half with a scalpel 
  17. Carefully transfer one half into a labelled specimen jar and cover with enough water to submerge sample.
  18. Store in refrigerator for further examination after >4Hr of refrigeration 
  19. With remaining piece, examine and record observations. 
  20.  Shred sample and transfer these into labelled specimen jar and cover with enough water to submerge sample. 
  21.  Place these in the fridge for further observation after >4hr of refrigeration
  22.  After observing samples, select suitable samples (cut into pieces if needed) to autoclave for use in cell culture 

  
  
Beancurd samples:  
  
Beancurd samples were purchased from the local IGA supermarket as these looked
as though they had potential as plant based scaffolds.

Plan for the sterilisation of Seitan and bean curd samples:

  1. Place samples into individual acetone washed glass petri dishes (for seitan samples) or beakers (for beancurd samples) 
  2. Wrap beak with foil and place lid on petri dishes. Seal with autoclave tape 
  3. Autoclave at 121 degrees for 20 minutes on dry run cycle 
  4. Remove from autoclave and place in refrigerator until needed

  
  
Plan for the seeding of Seitan samples:

  1. 96 well plate format: 
    1. Column 1: 100 min Gluten  

    2. Column 2: 130 min Gluten 
    3. Column 3: Autoclave Gluten    

    4. Column 4:  

    5. Column 5: 100 min Wheat + Gluten  

    6. Column 6: 130 min Wheat + Gluten  

    7. Column 7: Autoclave Wheat + Gluten  

    8. Column 8:  

    9. Column 9: 100 min Wheat  

    10. Column 10: 130 min Wheat   

    11. Column 11: Autoclave Wheat   

    12. Column 12:
  2.   

    1. Row a  cell free (control) 
    2. Row b - d - regular samples with cells    

    3. Row e cell free control 
    4. Row g - h dry heat samples 

Dry gluten sample: 1 hour 30 minutes

Seeding:

  1. Obtain cells from cell expansion team 
  2. Determine cell suspension volume required for seeding column 1 - 3, 5-7, 9 - 11 with 1 million cells per scaffold 
  3. Centrifuge samples and remove supernatant 
  4. Resuspend with growth media 
  5. Seed scaffolds with 70 uL of cell suspension (containing 1M cells) 
  6. Allow to rest in BSC for 30 minutes 
  7. Top up with remaining 180 uL growth media into each well 
  8. transfer plates into incubator
