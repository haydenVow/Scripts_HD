Prepare materials for thaw and seed:

2\. Aliquotted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then
placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath for a minimum of 20 minutes
prior to use:

  *  Growth media (for seeding):    12 mL 
  * Time that aliquot was placed in the water bath to warm before use:   09:47 a/pm 

  




## Thaw and seed vial:

3\. Collected the cryovial from Liquid Nitrogen storage & place in foam
floater in water bath for 5 min  09:55 - 10:00 a/pm

Location where cryovial was collected from:

Vial details:  1   x  1mL  cryovials at   1000K  cells each for a total of
1000 K  cells

Brew

Tower/Bucket # 6

Box/Cane # 6

Vial location: c6  

Vial ID(s):GT10l-p

`4. Ethanol sprayed & transferred the vial(s) to the BSC.`

`5.  Added  600µL of Growth Media (to generate a total volume of 1.2 mL in the
cryovial) to the cryovial, resuspended the cell suspension gently to reduce
osmotic shock. `

`6. Collected the entire 1.2mL of cell suspension & transfer into the pre-
warmed tube of Growth Media. `

`7. Using a 10mL serological pipette, resuspended & distributed the cells
evenly in the   12mL of pre-warmed Growth Media (prepared in Step 2). `

`8. Transfered   12mL to each pre-coated  1 x T75  flask/well.`

`9. Transfered flask/plate(s) to incubate at: `

  * [X]  30ºC, 5% CO2 (reptile cells)
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (aviary cells)

  

Making labels

Note - You will need to increase the passage number by one. (i.e. if your
thawed vial ID has a passage number of 3, when you make a culture ID for you
vessel you will need change the passage number to 4 on Airtable.)

Summary:

\- 600uL of thawed cells was added to 600uL growth media to make a 1.2mL
suspension which was then added to 11.4mL of Growth Media and subsequently
seeded.
