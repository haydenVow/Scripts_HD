Process:

1\. Aliquotted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then
placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath for a minimum of 20 minutes
prior to use:

  1. TrypLE:    600   mL in  1     bottle
  2. dPBS (for neutralising)    500  mL in     1   bottle
  3. Growth media (for pellet resuspension):       mL in        tubes
  4. Growth media (for seeding):    1500   mL in    8    tubes
  5. Times that all aliquots were placed in the water bath to warm before use    09:30 am 

Note: if aliquots were placed in water bath at different times, record the
time stamp for each individual solution.




2\. Washed the flask(s) with PBS.

3\. Added   200    mL tryple to each vessel/well and incubated at 30˚C for
5    min.

4\. Neutralised with    160mL   dPBS (warmed) and combined cell suspension
into a    250mL   tube.

5\. Centrifuged at 650 x g for 5 min

  1. Start/Finish time for centrifugation was   10 :46    \-    10:59  am 




6\. Aspirated the supernatant(s)

7\. Resuspended pellet(s) in      89.1  mL  DMEM/F12 +20% FBS +1% P/S
media.

8\. Performed a cell count using the haemocytometer and recorded the cell
count data in widget or the Google Doc spreadsheet called 'Cell Count
Spreadsheet' (see link below):

9\. Total cell number was:     394713000  

10\. Seeded ~7k cells per cm2 of the flasks/plates. Note that fibroblasts
prefer to be subcultured closely together. Flasks seeded at 7427 cells/cm2.

11\. Volume of cell suspension required for subculture was:     88.9mL  

12\. Transfer    10.6mL/4.25mL of cell suspension to the pre-warmed   1500
/600 mL Growth Media.

13\. Transfer cell suspension into (non-gelatin coated)     8x10CF + 1x 4CF
flasks/plates.

14\. Transfer flask/plate(s) to incubate at:

  * [ X ]  30ºC, 5% CO2 (reptile cells)
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (aviary cells)




Observations/Summary:

passage was conducted in Production Lab, and stored in thermo incubator in PL
(incubator 82).
