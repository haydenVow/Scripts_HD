During the early stages of the SCC pipeline, we need to monitor cell growth of
a large number of wells. Based on this information, we can decide which clones
growing nicely and should be passaged to larger vessels.

Previously, we have a machine learning model to determine the number of cells
in each well. During our first cloning run of this quarter (EPIC20859), we
observed some inaccuracies with this model, where some high confluence wells
were listed as '0' cells. So, to avoid the risk of missing any good clones, we
attempted staining with Hoechst to determine cell counts for our second
cloning run (EPIC21181). However, we observed cell death a couple of days
after performing this process. Therefore, this experiment aims to confirm
whether Hoechst staining cells affects their viability and which method of
staining is best of maintaining viability.
