Growth Media:

Prepare materials for thaw and seed:

2\. Aliquotted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then
placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath for a minimum of 20 minutes
prior to use:

  *  Growth media (for seeding):    10mL in 1 x 15mL   tubes 
  * Time that aliquot was placed in the water bath to warm before use:   16:15 a/pm

## Thaw and seed vial:

3\. Collected the cryovial from Liquid Nitrogen storage & place in foam
floater in water bath for 5 min  16:32 - 16:37 a/pm

Location where cryovial was collected from:

Vial details:  1   xcryovials at   500K  cells each for a total of    500K
cells

Brew

Tower/Bucket # 1

Box/Cane # 6

Vial location: F7  

Vial ID(s):2913

***ORIGINALLY THAWED OUT 2914 VIAL HOWEVER IT WAS FOUND LID OF CRYOVIAL WASNT
SCREWED ON PROPERLY HENCE COMPRIMISING ITS STERILITY - VIAL WAS DISCARDED AND
DELETED RECORD FROM STOCKYARD

`4. Ethanol sprayed & transferred the vial(s) to the BSC.`

`5.  Added  500µL of Growth Media (to generate a total volume of 1mL in the
cryovial) to the cryovial, resuspended the cell suspension gently to reduce
osmotic shock. `

`6. Collected the entire 1mL of cell suspension & transfer into the pre-warmed
10mL of Growth Media. `

`7. Using a 10mL serological pipette, resuspended & distributed the cells
evenly in the   10mL of pre-warmed Growth Media (prepared in Step 2). `

`8. Set up columns 3 - 12 as such so as to seed at cell densities 0, 1000,
2000, 3000, 4000, 5000, 6000, 7000 cells per well respectively.

Making labels

Note - You will need to increase the passage number by one. (i.e. if your
thawed vial ID has a passage number of 3, when you make a culture ID for you
vessel you will need change the passage number to 4 on Airtable.)

### Results:

  * Results were;
    * [X]  As Usual (this is a repetitive task)
    * [ ]  Unexpected because...
    * [ ]  Need to be further analysed
