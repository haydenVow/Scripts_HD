Perform feed using below volumes:




DIFF Media :

  * [x]  E6 + 1xP/S 
  * [x]  DMEM/F12 + 2% HS + 1xP/S. 

Total media required: 1.5 mL

Process:

1\. Aliquotted   3mL  mL of  E6 Media  and   2mL  mL of  2% HS Diff media
into  2x15mL     tube(s). Placed in water bath at   16:56  

2\. Removed 96 well plates from top binder incubator (#67, top shelf). Removed
100 % of media from each well on the 96 well plates.  

3\. Replaced with  150uL (per well) of  Diff   media.

  * Top row (E6 media) 
  * Bottom row (2% HS media). 

4\. Returned plates to incubate at: [17:46]

  * [x]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (aviary cells)
  * incubator #67. 




### Observations/Summary:

 100 % media changed on vessel(s)

Colour of old media was lighter pink than usual - perhaps larger numbers of
cells are exhausting nutrients quicker due to higher confluency acheived
during growth phase.
