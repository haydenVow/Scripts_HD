Methods and Experiment Layout


Experimental layout

We will attempt to seed six tissue discs with variable levels of TGFb in the
growth medium and consistent levels of Vitamin C (excluding the control
treatment-free tissue disc). Each disc will be a single replicate (condition)
excluding treatment-free condition.

Conditions will be as follows:

  1. 0ng/mLTGFb+0ug/mLVit.C (n=2, for 1x entire tissue for flow cytometry optimisation experiment) 
  2. 0ng/mLTGFb+0ug/mLVit.C with 300mL of growth medium (to compare the pH change with the usual 200mL growth medium/ culture currently used). 
  3. 0ng/mLTGFb+150ug/mLVit.C
  4. 10 ng/mL TGFb +150ug/mL Vit. C
  5. 20 ng/mL TGFb + 150ug/mL Vit. C
  6. 50 ng/mL TGFb + 150ug/mL Vit. C
  7. 100 ng/mL TGFb + 150ug/mL Vit. C

All conditions set to gel at 37C, 5%CO2 for 1.5 - 2.5 hours

  

Insert figure

Figure 1. Plate Map for Tissue Discs Experiment D, to determine the optimum
treatment levels. There are 4 conditions (n=1) with the control condition
having an n=2, with the condition details outlined within the figure. All
culture will have a cell density of 40M cells/ml with a gel matrix volume of
25ml.

Before Starting Ensure the Following is Completed
  
  
List the protocol used, broken down into sequential steps (using appropriate
templates), as well as any changes made to the protocol.

Include plate maps/diagrams, as well as any relevant widgets or calculators.

Note - Timestamps are not necessary but are encouraged on critical time
sensitive steps, such as fixation and staining with antibodies.  

Why? Having a clear step-by-step protocol for the lab user to follow will
reduce chance of error such as accidentally missing out steps. Timestamps on
critical steps act as a reminder to the user, and provide a good reference in
instances when a protocol fails e.g. if fixing and staining of a sample did
not work we can come back to the timestamps to ensure that timings were
accurate, if they were accurate we can assume that the timings need to be
adjusted or that the consumables or samples themselves were at fault.

Cell Supply Harvest and Matrix Formation for Seeding


## Preparation for Harvest

  1. Prepare 4 falcon tubes for cell harvest for 4 conditions of different cell densities (20M and 40M cells/mL) and 2 different seeding volumes (20mL and 25mL).
    1. Completed calculations can be found here
  2. Media preparation for harvest and seeding: 
    1. DMEM/F12 growth medium as above (table 1). 

## Cell Harvest for Mould seeding - Nuvonis suspension protocol

  1. Harvest cells with Cell Supply passaging protocol
  2.  ~~Count cells with haemocytometer/Vicell for total yields:~~
  3.   
Ranger Culture ID#     13196 Cellac#13195 Cellac  
Flask TypeE5000E5000  
Total Volume Used (mL)cell suspension combined and counted together  
Cell Concentration (cells/mL) 3.42 x10^6  
  4. Pour required volume of cell suspension for 1 tissue disc into 500mL centrifuge tubes:
    * 1B cells in 293 mL from # 13196 and 13195 
  5. Centrifuge at 500g for 5 minutes ~~(in 450mL centrifuge tubes~~ ) 
    1. 250mL centrifuge tubes used instead (2x tubes per 1Bn cells) and topped up to 200mL with autoclaved PBS. before centrifuging (as the large centrifuge was removed from the main lab space). 
  6. Remove supernatant and resuspend the pellet in 50mL of growth medium in a 50mL falcon tube (1Bn cells per 1x Falcon tube) 
  7. Centrifuge at 300g for 5 minutes.  
  8. Resuspend pellets in each centrifuge tubes in    12.1 mL   DMEM/F12 growth medium TOTAL (first resuspend in 5-7mL to account for pellet volume to make up to a total of 12.1ml)
    * NOTE: Resuspending the pellet is very thick and viscous and takes up a high volume. 
  9.  ~~Add required volume of cells+media to 4 falcon tubes~~ :
  10. Proceed to matrix additions below. 
    1. Bring out matrix additives from the fridge only until ready to use. 
  11. Repeat step 4-8 for each tissue. 

## Matrix formation for scaffold seeding - 2 cell densities + 2 tissue gel
volumes

N.B. Repeat this gel formation for each falcon tube at the same time - i.e.
Add Collagen to all, then add DMEM to all etc. - BUT be sure to move quickly!
Refer to Figure 2 to visualise the workflow.

1. Remove pluronic from the wells.

Condition 40M cells/mL  
(25mL tissue gel)  
n=1 tissue disc  
Step 1. Add cells+media12.1  
 Step 2. Add total Collagen (mL)10.15  
Step 3. Add total 10xDMEM/F12  
(mL)1.225  
Step 4. Add total  NaOH  
(mL)1.525  
Step 5. Pipette matrix into each well 25  
  
5\. Seed gel/matrix gently into scaffold ensuring good distribution around
pillars in the well.

6. Leave for    60-90    minutes to gel at 37Â°C - start time 

Duration left to gel (before adding growth medium and returning to incubator):

  * Condition 1a (Control untreated): 1 hour 15 minutes
  * Condition 1b (Control untreated replicate): 1 hour 15 minutes
  * Condition 2 (0ng/mLTGFb+150ug/mLVit.C): 2 hour 30 minutes 
  * Condition 3 (10 ng/mL TGFb +150ug/mL Vit. C): 1 hour 30 minutes 
  * Condition 4 (20 ng/mL TGFb + 150ug/mL Vit. C): 1 hour 15 minutes 
  * Condition 5 (50 ng/mL TGFb + 150ug/mL Vit. C): 2 hours 30 minutes 
  * Condition 6 (100 ng/mL TGFb + 150ug/mL Vit. C): 2 hours 30 minutes 

Note:: Add Growth media to the entire dish before the 3 hour time point (post-
seeding as the gel matrix environment begins to become stressful and
prohibitive for cell viability, especially when each tissue disc has a high
density (1B per disc at 40M cells/mL). Observing tissue matrices which have
not gelled is a valid result to be discussed in the results section below.

7\. Add     ~180-200ml media to entire 15mL dish, ensure entire mould is
covered.

8. Culture at 37Â°C overnight before checking.  18:00 - 20:00

workflow.

  




# Tips and Tricks for this protocol:

  * When pelleting cells, make sure they are completely dry
  * Flick pellet to dislodge before adding medium
  * Add Medium first to pellet to prevent clumping and cell death
  * Col1 is very viscous, pipette carefully - when adding 10x DMEM, it turns yellow
  * As soon as you add the NaOH, be quick as the Col starts to gel
  * Everything has to be exact, don't be tempted to add more cells than the volume stated if there are some left
  * Add cells slowly!

Additional advice observed during scale-up seeding protocol:

  * Coat plates in P-188 a day before
  * Leave to dry (after from EtOH soaking) in the BSC overnight
  * Make up reagents 1-2 weeks ahead of time. 
  * Centrifugation of cells can be initiated during the Pluronic-188 coating time frame. Note the supernatant can be quickly but carefully poured (to speed up the process). 
  * Less things in the BSC the better 
    * Avoid doing too many conditions at once (unless there is enough assistance to do this) as this leads to cultures remaining in a stressful environment longer than necessary. 
    * Centrifuging more than 4Bn  cells at once should be done with a second pair of hands to ensure the cells are not pelleted and stressed for excessive durations throughout the experiment. 
  * Add growth medium VERY VERY slowly (water fall/ droplets at zero speed on the pipette guns) with the tip of the pipette pointing at the wall of the disc scaffold. Never point the end of the pipette directly at the tissue disc (point at the wall of the culture vessel). 


Results / Observations


Include notes and observations taken on the day including visual or handling
observations (i.e. cells appeared to clump, material changes colour or changed
in size) as well as any limitations encountered, optimisations or changes made
to the protocol, pictures or videos of the experimental setup  
  
Why? Good observations and notes on changes ensure experiment reproducibility

and the optimisation of future work




Bioprocess/ Technical Observations:

  * Completion of this experiment went smoothly without any set backs. 
  * Coating
    * no issues observed
  * Pellet:
    * 250mL centrifuge tubes were used instead of 450mL tubes.
    * Pellet in the 250mL centrifuge tube was quite soft but did not dislodge when aspirating supernatant. 
    * All Pellets measured at just under the 5mL mark (in the 50mL Falcon tube) at the second centrifugation step (step 6)). 
  * Future notes for overall improvement:
    * Coat plates a day before
    * Leave to dry (after from EtOH soaking) in the BSC overnight
    * Make up reagents 1-2 weeks ahead of time. 
    * Centrifugation of cells can be initiated during the Pluronic-188 coating time frame. Note the supernatant can be quickly but carefully poured (to speed up the process). 
    * Less things in the BSC the better 
    * Avoid doing too many conditions at once (unless there is enough assistance to do this) as this leads to cultures remaining in a stressful environment longer than necessary. 
      * Centrifuging more than 4Bn  cells at once should be done with a second pair of hands to ensure the cells are not pelleted and stressed for excessive durations throughout the experiment. 
    * Add growth medium VERY VERY slowly (water fall/ droplets at zero speed on the pipette guns) with the tip of the pipette pointing at the wall of the disc scaffold. Never point the end of the pipette directly at the tissue disc (point at the wall of the culture vessel). 

Gelation Observations:

  * All cultures appeared to turning from opaque magenta to yellow within 15 minutes post seeding. 
  * All cultures gelled (to varing degrees). 
  * No differences were observed during the gelation timefram post-seeding. 

Questions:

  * How can we speed up the seeding process?
