### Cell Harvest

  1. Turn on water bath and set temperature to 37C.
  2. Take the flasks for harvest and observe under the microscope at 4x objective for even cell distribution . Refer to VSOP-006. Take 2-3 images per flask.
  3. Aliquot required volume of dPBS (37C), dPBS (ambient temp) and TrypLE in separate sterile pots.  Refer to Table above for required volume.
  4. Place aliquots in pre-warmed water bath and leave for ~20 minutes or until warmed. Note: Ensure TrypLE is thoroughly warmed.  
`    Time stamp` : 8:00am  

  5. Transfer aliquots and flasks required for harvest into the BSC.
  6. Save growth media from each flask into 1L bottles.
  7. Wash with warmed dPBS, and save into 1L bottles with collected growth media. --> These bottle contain aggregates, wait for them to settle, and then aspirate the top portion of supernatant, leaving about 50-100mL remaining and then dispense into 50mL tubes using a strippette.
  8. Add TrypLE to each of the flasks. Mix thoroughly to ensure coverage of the surface area.
  9. Place in the incubator at 37C. After 10 minutes, remove flasks and agitate to encourage maximum dissociation of cells. Incubate further until maximum dissociation level is reached.  
     NOTE: The flasks must be removed from the incubator within 18 minutes of initial incubation of TrypLE containing flasks.

  10. Aspirate the TrypLE solution and collect into 1L Bottle. 
  11. Dispense ambient temperature dPBS to create a final wash for each of the flasks. Shake flasks well to ensure collection of as much cells as possible.
  12. Pour PBS wash into the same 1L bottle containing TrypLE'd cells. 
  13. Aliquot the 1L cell suspension mix into 20x50mL tubes.
  14. Centrifuge at 700 x g for 5 minutes. ``

  15. Gently remove centrifuge tubes from the machine, ensuring not to disturb the suspended pellets. Transfer tubes into the Library lab BSC.
  16. Aspirate the supernatant from the tubes. Discard supernatant. Remove as much remaining supernatant with a 1mL pipette if required.  

  17. Resuspend each pellet with 1-2mL media (PRF DMEM/F12 + 10% FBS) using a 25mL pipette and combine into 8x50mL tubes.
  18. Wash out all 50mL tubes with 10mL media per 20x50mL tubes and combine with cell suspension.

### Re-pellet and Weigh Final Yield

  1. Label and Record the weight of 1x250mL sterile centrifuge tube and set aside. Record details in Table.  
  2. Centrifuge tubes at 700 x g x 5 minutes. Time: 13:00pm
  3. Aspirate the supernatant from the tubes, leaving approximately 5mL of resuspension media.
  4. Re-suspend the cell pellet in the tube and combine into the weighed tube. (Also use 5-10mL media to wash out the 50mL tubes and combine into the weighed tube)
  5.  This concentrated cell suspension may be stored at 4'C until ready for pelleting, or continue with pelleting. Stored @ 4'C : 13:25pm
  6. Centrifuge at 700 x g x 5 minutes. 
  7. Aspirate the supernatant from the tubes. Remove as much remaining supernatant with a 1mL pipette.
  8. Record the final weight of the cell pellet. Enter details in Table. 
  9. Immediately provide to the food team for testing.
