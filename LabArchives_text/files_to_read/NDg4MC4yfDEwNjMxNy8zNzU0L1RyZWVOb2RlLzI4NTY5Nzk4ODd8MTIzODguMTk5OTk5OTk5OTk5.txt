Process:

Preparing BSA standard curve:

  1. Used absorbances from standards made on 02-09.

Freeze-thaw lysis method:

  1. Aliquotted Tryple and PBS in order to produce a cell suspension.
  2. Warmed Tryple and PBS in water bath for 5 mins 09:43am
  3. Washed wells with 200uL of PBS and then subsequently added 200uL of Tryple.
  4. Incubated plate for 15 mins and monitored cell detachment. Once > 90% of cells have detached, combined suspensions from each seeding density (x6) into one falcon tube per density (x3).
  5. Centrifuged the three falcon tube for 5 mins at 650g. Aspirate Tryple from each falcon tube and resuspend in 1mL dPBS.
  6. -Froze each microfuge tube quickly in liquid nitrogen and left for 3 mins

Cycle 1 : 10:42 - 10:45am

Cycle 2 : 10:50 - 10:53am

Cycle 3 : 11:02 - 11:05am

Cycle 4 : N/A - but done  

  1. Thawed the three tubes immediately in water bath for 3 minutes. Vortex to mix well.
  2. Repeated process three more times
  3. Placed microfuge tubes inside 15 mL falcon tubes and span down for 5 mins at 650g
  4. At this point lysis efficiency was checked on haemocytometer and it appeared all cells had lysed succesfully and only debris was noticed (see images)

  1. Collected 100uL of supernatant per sample and place in marked microcentrifuge tubes.
  2. Performed serial dilutions of each L, M and H seeding density tubes as follows:

  1. Added 250uL of Bradford reagent to 18 wells (one well per dilution and then run in triplicate) on an untreated 96 well plate for each density.
  2. Add 5uL of each sample to the respective wells and mixed thoroughly with a P200 pipette.
  3. Centrifuge plate at 650g for 5 mins (also conveniently the incubation period for the binding of Coomassie Brilliant Blue).
  4. Read the plate in the plate reader at 595nm with the lid removed.

Testing Tryple with Bradford reagent:

1\. In order to determine whether the presence of Tryple would affect the
final Abs values, 5uL of Tryple was added to the same plate and 250uL of
Bradford was added correspondingly.

2\. Centrifuged for 5 mins at 650g.

3\. Read at 595nm on plate reader (see file attached below)




Observations/Summary:

Limitations:

  * Tryple was used to detach cells and being a recombinant protein there is a chance it would skew the final Abs values from our assay (see .csv files). It was found that Tryple has a low Abs but still above the limit of detection (LOD). While our final solutions would only have residual amounts of Tryple, it could still play a part in skewing the results.
  * Cells were successfully detached from the Low seeding density wells (see picture below) however varying degrees of detachment were observed for medium and high wells thus skewing results.

the M and H conditions.  
  
  

  * Tedious nature manually pipetting 5uL into 250uL Bradford reagent
  * Lysates were not placed on ice or similar at all times in when out of the fridge/freezer.
  * Centrifugation process was putting microfuge tubes and placing them in 15mL falcon tubes and using the Library Lab centrifuge to spin them down. While this was successful for our purposes - it is not something that is recommended.

  

Future directions:

Proposed new protocol:

  * Remove E6 and wash multiple times with PBS to remove serum proteins 
  * Freeze the plate itself in LN2 bath instead of using TrypLE and having detachment issues
  * Thaw in water bath 
  * Repeat process 4 times and ensure detachment by loading lysate under haemocytometer slide. Keep lysate tubes on ice while this occurs
  * Transfer lysate to microcentrifuge tubes and centrifuge at 650g for 5 mins.
  * Aspirate 100uL of supernatant and transfer to corresponding wells on a fresh 96 well plate. Keep plate cold by placing on ice.
  * Perform dilutions in the well plate using water or PBS (ensure that whichever one that is used is also used as the blank) as the diluent.
  * In a new 96 well plate, add 250uL bradford reagent to the corresponding wells.
  * Add 5uL of the sample to each of the corresponding wells.
  * Mix well and spin plate down for 5 mins to remove bubbles (also the incubation time).
  * Read at 595 using plate reader.
