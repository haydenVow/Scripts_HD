### Preparation of reagents  

For Passage: Heat the following to 30C in the water bath

  1. TrypLE:     60 mL in      1  tub
  2.  dPBS (for neutralising):   60  mL
  3.  dPBS (for washing):     60 mL
  4. DMEM + 20% FBS + 1 x PS for pellet resuspension + Seeding):    1.5 L

Time that all aliquots were placed in the water bath the warmed to 30C before
use  15:10

Note: if aliquots were placed in water bath at different time, record the time
stamp for each individual solution.




Passage  

  1. Took representative images of 2x flasks (see MIA links)
  2. Washed the vessel(s) with dPBS (warmed). 15:40
  3. Added 10ml tryple to each vessel/well and incubated at 30ËšC.
  4. Start/Finish for TrypLE was   15:55-16:05  

  5. Neutralised each with with   dPBS (equal to volume of tryple) and transferred to 3x 50mL  tubes.
  6. Centrifuged at 650 x g for 5 min.
  7. Start/Finish time for centrifugation was 16:12-16:17  

  8. Aspirated the supernatant(s).
  9. Resuspended pellet(s) in   40 mL   growth  media
  10.  Aliquoted   50uL  of resuspended cells into a micro centrifuge tube for cell count.
  11. Performed a cell count using the haemocytometer and recorded the cell count data in the Google Doc spreadsheet called 'Cell Count Spreadsheet' (see link below):

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1DPzKubYxfHmWogVPihC-
SSIBtIylyrBQE5kRX5Z8NtI/edit#gid=0  

    1. Total cell count was : 31,200,000
    2. Re-seeded approximately cells into 1X 2cF AND 1X5CS flasks, giving a seeding density of 7020/cm
    3.  Incubate at 30C and 5% CO2. 17:00
