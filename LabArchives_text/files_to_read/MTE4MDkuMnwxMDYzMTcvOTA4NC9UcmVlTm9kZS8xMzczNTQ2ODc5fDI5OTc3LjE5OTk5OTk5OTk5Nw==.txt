Experimental Plan


Tissue discs for experiment B have been matured for 10 days. Tissue formation
looks good in 2 conditions - Control (0.1M NaOH) and 0.2M NaOH condition -
from a qualitative assessment of tissue structure and integrity. Tissues will
now be characterised using a variety of methods which are outlined here. Given
the fact there is only a single replicate per condition, we will be maximising
the amount of analyses that we can perform on the tissue using technical
replicates - different regions of the same tissue.

Briefly, both tissue discs cultured for experiment B will be separated for 3
types of tissue preparation: Tissue digestion, Snap-freezing and Fixation.

Methods


Buffer Preparation

Digestion Buffer 1 (100ml) -750U/mL Collagenase type II in DMEM/F12

FACS Buffer -  1% BSA, 2mM EDTA

Fixation Buffer -  4% Paraformaldehyde in PBS

  

Other preparation

Turn on FACS machine and set up!!  

  1. Prepare 12 labelled Eppendorf tubes for snap freezing
  2. Prepare 1x labelled 6 well plates for initial PBS wash and fixation
  3. Prepare 6 labelled specimen pots for digestion
  4. Prepare 6 labelled 50ml falcons with 70um cell strainers in
  5. Prepare 6 labelled 15ml falcons
  6. Prepare 6 labelled FACS tubes

Tissue Harvest

  1. Cut tissues with a scalpel or fine scissors at the "cut point" and remove from the mould with forceps and a large spatula
  2. Wash samples once in PBS
  3. Weigh tissue in weighing boat and record the weight below
  4. In a clean petri dish, cut tissues as per figure 1 above
  5. Place samples into PBS for further prep

TISSUE SAMPLEWEIGHT (g)Observations  
0.1M3.35+3.42Tissue has custard like consistency, but does hold its structure
relatively well.  
0.2M3.14+2.92Slightly better structure and holds together as single piece.
Still soft in consistency  
  
  
  
Notes from all sample

\- Colour =

\- Texture on outside =

\- Texture on inside =  

\- the tissue that wraps around the poll is a bit more sturdier than the
middle which is a bit more fragile * is this true again?

  

  

Fixation (for Microscopy)

  1. Fix tissue in a 6 well plate in 4% PFA in PBS (Fixation buffer) overnight at 4degs
  2. Following day, wash 3x5mins in PBS Start time: 
  3. Store tissue in PBS + 0.02% Sodium Azide in 4 degs

Fixed tissue will be taken to UNSW in 70% Ethanol for tissue processing,
paraffin embedding, sectioning and some slides (every other?) will be used for
H&E staining and subsequent slide-scanning.

Snap Freezing (for Molecular Analyses)

  1. Tissue segment for snap-freezing will be further cut into 2 or 3 pieces (depending on handling ease)
  2. Each portion will be placed into an Eppendorf tube
  3. Snap-freeze Eppendorf tubes in liquid nitrogen for 3-5 seconds each
  4. Place in the -80 freezer

Snap frozen tissues will be used for proteomic analysis and possibly other
molecular analyses at a later date (when we have built up a larger number of
samples)

Digestion (for Flow Cytometry)

  1. Remove the tissue portion from PBS and place onto a clean petri dish
  2. Add a few drops of digestion buffer onto the tissue
  3. Using the lid of a 15ml falcon tube, gently crush tissue into a cell paste
  4. Place minced tissue into a specimen pot with 10ml digestion buffer
  5. Incubate with agitation for 10 mins 16:13-16:23 
    1. Room temperature
    2. 60rpm on a Thermo Fischer shaking plate.
  6. Place 70um cell strainer into 50ml falcon and wet the strainer with digestion buffer
  7. Pipette minced tissue into the cell strainer and ensure that all tissue has passed through, and a single cell suspension is formed
  8. Centrifuge at 500g for 5 minutes
  9. Wash pellet with PBS.
  10. Resuspend cells in 10mL of FACS buffer
  11. Count 500ul
    1. 0.1M NaOH: 14.3 cells/mL
    2. 0.2M NaOH: 14.7 cells/mL
  12. Place cell suspension into 15ml falcon tube
  13. Centrifuge at 500g for 5 minutes
  14. Resuspend in XX uL of Annexin V Binding Buffer at a concentration of 0.25-1.0 x 10^6 cells/mL
  15. Transfer 100 µL of cell suspension in a 1.5 mL eppendorf
  16. Add 5 µL of FITC Annexin V
  17. Add 10 µL of Propidium Iodide Solution. 
  18. Gently vortex the cells and incubate for 15 min at room temperature (25°C) in the dark.
  19. Add 400 µL of Annexin V Binding Buffer to each tube.
  20. Wet FACS tube filter with 1/2 drops FACS buffer
  21. Place pipette tip flush with filter and pipette quickly into FACS tubes
  22. Perform flow cytometry on all samples
