96 well plate6983-C2C12-Mouse P4-1of1  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  




Process:

1\. Aliquotted  12 mL  mL of  E6 Media into  1 x 15mL Centrifuge     tube(s).
Placed in water bath   17:35 a/pm

2\. Removed  100  % of supernatant from vessel.

3\. Replaced with   150 uL (per well) of  E6   media.

4\. Returned vessel to incubate at:

  * [X]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (aviary cells)

  

  * Incubator (# Thermo  ), Lab [Main]




### Observations/Summary:

100  % media changed on vessel(s)

  1. Some yellowing of media observed in wells prior to feeding (no pattern, random) - potentially due to cells exhausting nutrients quicker in later stages of maturation.
