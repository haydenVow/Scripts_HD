Prepare materials for thaw and seed:

1\. Gelatin coated  3  x  t175  flasks/plates with sterile filtered 0.1%
gelatin solution and then incubated all coated flasks at 37ºC

  * Time when all flasks placed into the incubator   13:28  a/pm 

2\. Aliquotted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then
placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath for a minimum of 20 minutes
prior to use:

  *  Growth media (for seeding):    90mL in   1x120mL pot  

  * Time that aliquot was placed in the water bath to warm before use:   2:55 a/pm 

  




## Thaw and seed vial:

3\. Collected the cryovial from Liquid Nitrogen storage & place in foam
floater in water bath for 5 min  : - : a/pm

Location where cryovial was collected from:

Vial details:  1   x  DAISY4_16G9, MCB_2 cryovials at   500K  cells each for a
total of    500K  cells

Brew

Tower/Bucket #1  

Box/Cane #4  

Vial location:G2

Vial ID(s): 2453-Culture-6335-Vial-1of23  

`4. Ethanol sprayed & transferred the vial(s) to the BSC.`

`5.  Added  500µL of Growth Media (to generate a total volume of 1mL in the
cryovial) to the cryovial, resuspended the cell suspension gently to reduce
osmotic shock. `

`6. Collected the entire 1mL of cell suspension & transfer into the pre-warmed
90mL pot of Growth Media. `

`7. Using a 25mL serological pipette, resuspended & distributed the cells
evenly in the   90mL of pre-warmed Growth Media (prepared in Step 2). `

`8. Transfered   30mL to each pre-coated  T175  flask after removing excess
gelatin. allowed to rest in the BSC at RT for 20 min  17:00 - 17:20 a/pm ```  

`9. Transfered flask/plate(s) to incubate at: `

  * [x]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells), incubator 67.
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (aviary cells)

Applied bec drop technique inside the incubator to ensure that cells that had
not adhered were evenly distributed.
