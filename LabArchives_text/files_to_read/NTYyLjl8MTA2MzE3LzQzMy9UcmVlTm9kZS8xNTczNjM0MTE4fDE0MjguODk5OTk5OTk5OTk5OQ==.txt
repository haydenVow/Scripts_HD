D1 Prolif samples- Fix, DAPI stain and Image 1 sample from each condition,
Note down whether there is a good cell coverage across the material/scaffold
surface.

Process:

1\. Removed plate culture IDs: 6460-DOLLY12-Sheep P10-1of1 containing
scaffolds from the incubator.

2\. Used sterile tweezers to carefully transfer   4x (highlighted in bold in
the image above)   scaffold pieces to separate wells on a 24 well plate.

3\. Washed the pieces in the 24 well plate 3x in   1  mL of PBS for  5
minutes at room temperature.

  1.  14:15 - 14:20   

  2.  14:22 - 14:27   

  3.  14:29 - 14:34   

  




4\. Added 500 uL of 4% PFA to each scaffold and incubate for  15  min at room
temperature.  14:36 - 14:51  

5\. Washed pieces once more for 5 minutes in PBS at room temperature.   14:52
- 14:57

6\. Aspirate PBS and stain the pieces with  200 uL of DAPI in PBS (1:1000)
(999 uL of dPBS and 1 uL DAPI) for 5 minutes in the dark.   14:58 - 13:03  

  




7\. Wash the pieces 3 times for   5    minutes in   1  mL of PBS.

  1.  13:04 - 13:09   

  2.  13:11 - 13:16   

  3.  13:17 - 13:22   

  

8\. Aspirate the PBS and leave the scaffold pieces just covered by fresh PBS.

label the plate halves with the respective culture IDs and date of fixing
and/or staining
