### Process:

1\. Took image of vessel with microscope on phase setting.

3\. Aliquotted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then
placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath for a minimum of 20 minutes
prior to use:

  1. TrypLE:     10    mL in      1   tubes
  2.  dPBS (for neutralising):     3 x 3mL    mL
  3.  dPBS (for washing):    3 x 3mL     mL
  4. Growth media (for seeding and counts):    3 x 5.5mL   mL 

Time that all aliquots were placed in the water bath the warm before use
14:26 - : pm

Note: if aliquots were placed in water bath at different time, record the time
stamp for each individual solution.




4\. Removed vessel(s) from the incubator   14:30 pm

Use a different serological for each flask!

5\. Washed the vessel(s) with dPBS (warmed).

6\. Added   3   mL tryple to each vessel/well and incubated at 37˚C.

  1. Start/Finish for TrypLE was    14:40 pm 

7\. Neutralised with    3   dPBS and combined cell suspension into a      1
tube per flask.

8\. Centrifuged at 650 x g for 5 min.

  1. Start/Finish time for centrifugation was   14:57 - 15:02 pm 



  * 1A16: 450K
  * 3P23: 154K
  * 4C4: 666K
  * Volume of cell suspension required for subculture was:  
    1. 1A16:    194 uL      

    2.  3P23: all 500uL  

    3. 4C4:   131 uL  

  * Cell density per vessel:     7000 cells/cm^2  ( 175 000 cells in T25 flask)  




13\. Transferred      required     µl of cell suspension to the pre-warmed
5mL     mL Growth media for each clone:      15:40 pm

16\. Transferred vessel(s) to incubate at: 15:44 pm  

  * [X]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (avian cells)
