### Process:

1\. Inspected wells under the microscope, 5x objective to observe which clones
were 100% confluent. Wells 100% confluent were set up for passage below.

2\. Filled one well on a 6 well plate with 3mL of growth media (DMEM/F12 + 20%
FBS + 1xP/S) for each clone destined to be picked. (11 wells total)




  

3\. Plates were removed from the incubator and all supernatant was aspirated
and discarded.

4\. Wells were washed with 1mL of dPBS, washes were then discarded and
replaced with 1mL of Tryple+EDTA before plates were returned to incubate at 30
degrees, 5% CO2 for 8-12 minutes.

5\. 2mL of dPBS was added to each well to neutralise the tryple, well contents
were collected and transferred to 15mL tubes.

6\. Tubes were spun at 500g for 5 minutes.

7\. Supernatant was removed and cells were resuspended in 1mL of dPBS (#82, 30
degrees C, 5% CO2).

8\. 500uL was transferred to a 1.5mL eppendorf tubes for later DNA extraction.

9\. 200uL of each suspension was added back to a 6 well plate containing
prewarmed growth media (D/F12 + 20% FBS + 1xP/S) plates were placed in the
incubator at 30 degrees, 5% CO2, incubator #82.  

10\. 1.5mL tubes were spun for 5 minutes at 500g, supernatant was then
discarded and pellets were resuspended in 25uL of Quick Extract solution.

11\. Samples were put through the BentoLab quick extraction protocol.

\- 65 degrees for 5 minutes followed by 98 degrees for 120 seconds, then a 12
degree hold.

12\. Samples were transferred to the frdige.




Observations/Summary:

As clones were not counted prior to passage, seeding density will be different
between each culture as a result. Doublings cannot be estimated from this data
either as 300uL of remaining cells were discarded. d
