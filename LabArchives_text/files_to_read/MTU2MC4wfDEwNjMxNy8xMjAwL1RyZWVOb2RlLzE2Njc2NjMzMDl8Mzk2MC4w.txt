Perform thaw using below volumes:

  * [ ]  DMEM/F12 + 20% FBS + 1X P/S + 25ng/mL FGF-basic + P38i (10uM)

  




Prepare materials for thaw and seed:

1\. Gelatin coated  9  x  T175  flasks/plates with sterile filtered 0.1%
gelatin solution and then incubated all coated flasks at 37ºC  (Note: 1 vial
is seeded into 3 x T175)

  * Time when all flasks placed into the incubator   09:33 

2\. Aliquotted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then
placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath for a minimum of 20 minutes
prior to use:

  *  Growth media (for seeding):  270  mL in  1x 300 mL  container   

  * Time that aliquot was placed in the water bath to warm before use:   11:10 

  




## Thaw and seed vial:

  1. Collected the cryovial from Liquid Nitrogen storage & place in foam floater in water bath for 5 min 11 23: - 11:28 
  2. Location where cryovial was collected from: 

Vial details:  3   x  DOLLY12  WCB cryovials at   540K  cells each for a total
of   1620 K  cells

` `

  1. `Ethanol sprayed & transferred the vial(s) to the BSC.`
  2. `Added 500 µL of Growth media (to generate a total volume of 1 mL in the cyrovial) to the cyrovial, reuspended the cell suspension gently to reduce osmotic shock. `
  3. `Collected the entire 1 mL of cell suspension and transfer into the prewarmed tube of growth media. `
  4. `Using a serological pipette, resuspend and distribute the cells evenly in the  270 mL of pre-warmed Growth media. `
  5. `Transfered   30 mL to each pre-coated  T175 (x9) flask, allow to rest in the BSC at RT for 30 minutes  11:42 - 12:12 ```
  6. `Transfered flask/plate(s) to incubate at: `

  * [X]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells) THERMO
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (aviary cells)

  

Making labels

Note - You will need to increase the passage number by one. (i.e. if your
thawed vial ID has a passage number of 3, when you make a culture ID for you
vessel you will need change the passage number to 4 on Airtable.)
