### Process:

1\. Took image of vessel with microscope on phase setting.

2\. Gelatin coated    1      x    6 well plate      vessel with sterile
filtered 0.1% gelatin solution and then incubated all coated flasks at 37˚C.

  1. Time when all vessels(s) placed into the incubator       9:25   am 

3\. Aliquotted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then
placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath for a minimum of 20 minutes
prior to use:

  1. TrypLE:    1     mL in     1    tubes
  2.  dPBS (for washing and neutralising):     5    mL in    1    tube
  3. Growth media (for seeding):     5    mL in    1     tubes

Time that all aliquots were placed in the water bath the warm before use
9:38 am

Note: if aliquots were placed in water bath at different time, record the time
stamp for each individual solution.




4\. Removed vessel(s) from the incubator     9:40   am

5\. Washed the vessel(s) with dPBS (warmed).

6\. Added     0.2    mL tryple to each vessel/well and incubated at 37˚C.

  1. Start/Finish for TrypLE was     9:42am 

7\. Neutralised with    0.3mL      dPBS and combined cell suspension into a
15mL    tube.

8\. Centrifuged at 650 x g for 5 min.

  1. Start/Finish time for centrifugation was     10:00-10:05   am 




9\. Aspirated the supernatant(s).

10\. Resuspended pellet(s) in     0.5    mL    endothelial growth      media
10:06   am

11\. Aliquoted      10uL    of resuspended cells into a microcentrifuge tube
for cell count.

12\. Performed a cell count using the haemocytometer and recorded the cell
count data in the Google Doc spreadsheet called 'Cell Count Spreadsheet' (see
link below):

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1DPzKubYxfHmWogVPihC-
SSIBtIylyrBQE5kRX5Z8NtI/edit#gid=0

  1.  Total cell number was:     40,000 cells        

  2. Volume of cell suspension required for subculture was:     entire      




13\. Transferred      entire     µl of cell suspension to the pre-warmed
2.5     mL Growth media:      10:10    am

14\. Transferred cell suspension into the pre-gelatin coated      1 well of a
6 well plate      vessel.

15\. Transferred vessel(s) to incubate at: 10:15am

Observations/Summary:

Based on observations, it is hard to say if there are live cells in this
sample - going to leave with media & monitor while making a backup plan for
endothelial cell isolation.

However, there were ~40k cells based on the cell count. Going to that from ~4k
cells (with possible loss due to cell death) in 1 week isn't so bad. Will
order media that is hopefully further optimised for these cells to get them
growing a bit faster




### Results:

  * Results were;
    * [ ]  As Usual (this is a repetitive task)
    * [ x ]  Unexpected because...unclear if cells are present
    * [ ]  Need to be further analysed
    * [ ]  Other (.......)
