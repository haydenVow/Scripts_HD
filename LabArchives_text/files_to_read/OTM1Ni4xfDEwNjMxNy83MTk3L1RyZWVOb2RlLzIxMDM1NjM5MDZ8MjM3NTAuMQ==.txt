Aim/Purpose


To perform a X-factor DSD to determine the impact of X media ingredients on
the growth of Y cells


Hypothesis


We hypothesise that >1 ingredient at the levels tested will have a
significantly positive impact on Y cell growth


Technical Gap



Method/Procedure


  1. D0: Prepare working stocks of each factor 
  2. D0: Perform media mixing on OT2 to generate media conditions. Mix control media conditions manually. 
  3. D0: Add media to plates on OT2 and seed cells manually 
  4. D0: Image plates on Zaber (phase, 5X)
  5. D2: Image plates on Zaber (phase, 5X)
  6. D5: Perform live/dead stain and dilutions on OT2.
  7. D5: Image plates on Zaber (phase + AF488 + DAPI, 5X)
  8. D5: Run images through Mia Analysis macro for suspension cells 
  9. D6: Export macro output to spreadsheets to determine cells/mL. Perform statistical analysis in Prism.
