Extra notes:  
  
In order to use up a palletank with media containing cadmium (MIX-13380), the
harvest line from this palletank tank was sterility connected to the "non-
sterile" end of a 30-inch filter in a BSC (this end was ultimately welded onto
the palletank harvest line). A tubing end was then sterilely connected onto
the "sterile" end of the 30 inch filter. This line was then welded onto a line
from the bioreactor bag. The media was then pumped from the palletank harvest
line, through the filter and into the bioreactor bag. A total of 135L was
added to the bioreactor. Tubing was then sealed on the "non-sterile" end using
the biosealer.

  

Tubing from mixing tank was then connected to the "non-sterile" end of the 30
inch filter and the media was filtered into the bag as normal.

  
  
Probe attachment:

pH probe was calibrated on the STR 2000 software according to the instructions
written in this notion page https://www.notion.so/vow/Using-re-usable-probes-
in-STR2000L-bags-07a6a2a9038e4b719989f3862cea50a3 and autoclaved for 40 mins
at 121'C on a wet cycle inside the sterile probe insertion manifold (see
details below). DO probe was not calibrated, only autoclaved using the same
method as described above.

pH and DO probes were connected to the bag according to this video

All the other reusable probe ports were sealed off using clamps
