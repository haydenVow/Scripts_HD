  1. Turn on the water bath and set to 37'C.
  2. Aliquot  required growth media into a sterile container/s and add:  
    i) Vitamin C (aka LAA2P) [stock concentration 100mg/mL] to a working concentration of 50ug/mL in growth media i.e. 500uL per 1L of media.  
   ii) TGF-b1 [stock concentration 0.002mg/L] to a working concentration of
10ng/mL in growth media i.e. 5mL per 1L of media.

  3. Place in the water bath and heat for at least 20 minutes.
  4. Observe the cell flasks for confluence under the microscope using 4 x magnification and take images as required. 
  5. Transfer flasks to the BSC and remove required volume of media from each flask (according to the Table above).
  6. Replace the same volume into each flask with the prepared growth media.
  7. Return the flasks to the incubator.
