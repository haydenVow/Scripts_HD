Process:

  1. Aliquotted  21 mL  mL of  E6 Media 
  2. Placed in water bath 09:55 am - 10:55 am 
  3. Imaged all wells of plate ID 8706 and the first three columns of plate ID 8707 (a 4x image per well on the Primo should be fine).
  4. Removed 100% of supernatant from vessel, changing tips while aspirating from each column (as the seeding conditions vary column-wise).
  5. Replaced with 1mL (per well/per vessel) of E6 media using a fresh tip.
  6. Returned vessel to incubate at:  11:11 am
