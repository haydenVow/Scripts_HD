## Performed by:




## Hycell Cho

348 well plates need 40 uL per well - 5 plates per gene target (76.8 mL )

mini bioreactor tubes need 5 mL per tube - 2 per gene target (10 mL)

Total per experiment first sort = 86.8 mL per gene target

The mini bioreactor tubes will need to be fed every 3-4 days for 3-4 weeks -
(80 mL)

384 well plates will just need topping up periodically (76.8 mL)

= 243.6 mL per gene

6 x genes in january = 1461.6 mL

We will make up 3000 mL to satisfy Jan and Feb

  1. Reconstituted HyCell CHO powdered medium according to product instructions 
    1. Osmolaltiy: 9.96
    2. pH: 6.7
  2. Added 1 molar NaOH drop-wise to increase pH. Final pH: 7.4
  3. Prepared basal medium without KSR

Antibiotic Free DMEM/F12 20% FBS media for nucleofections

Need 18 wells of a 6 well plate per gene = 54 mL

108 mL for 2 gene targets

6 genes in january = 324

We will make up 350mL, just enough for this as without antibiotics it is best
to make up relatively fresh

140 mL DMEM

140 mL F12

70 mL FBS

total = 350 mL
