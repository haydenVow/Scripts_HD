Prepare materials for thaw and seed:

1\. Aliquotted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then
placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath for a minimum of 20 minutes
prior to use:

  *  Growth media (for seeding):    20 mL 
  * Growth media (for re-suspending during cell count):   5 mL     

  * Time that aliquot was placed in the water bath to warm before use:    13:35      




## Thaw and seed vial:

2\. Collected the cryovial from Liquid Nitrogen storage & place in foam
floater in water bath for 5 min  14:01 -14:04  

Location where cryovial was collected from:

Vial details:   1  x   F_DOLLY12 cryovials at   1M  cells each for a total of
1M  cells

`3. Ethanol sprayed & transferred the vial(s) to the BSC.`

`4.  Added  500µL of Growth Media (to generate a total volume of 1mL in the
cryovial) to the cryovial, resuspended the cell suspension gently to reduce
osmotic shock. `

`5. Took 1 x 10 uL sample from 1 mL cell suspension for cell count`  

`6. Collected the entire 1 mL of cell suspension & transferred into the pre-
warmed tube of 5 mL of Growth Media. `

`7. Performed cell count. Count = 1,020,000  
`

`8. Transferred   3.3mL to growth medium for seeding to make up to 20 mL with
600,000 cells `

`9. Transferred 5 mL of cell suspension to each T25 flask  
`

`9. Transferred flasks to incubate at: 14:56`

  * [X]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (aviary cells)

  

Making labels

Note - You will need to increase the passage number by one. (i.e. if your
thawed vial ID has a passage number of 3, when you make a culture ID for you
vessel you will need change the passage number to 4 on Airtable.)
