  9. Increased the stirring to 270 RPM 15:56
  10. After 6 minutes, took samples for imaging 16:01
  11. After 7 minutes, reduced the stirring to 90 RPM 16:02
  12. Took phase contrast micrographs of culture - cells were not fully detached
  13. After 15 minutes, added 500 mL of growth medium 16:12 - 16:17
  14. Took samples for imaging 16:14
  15. Took phase contrast micrographs of culture - cells were mostly free-floating
  16. Pumped out the cell suspension to the harvest bottle 16:17 - 16:36
  17. Added 1 L of dPBS 16:37 - 16:47
  18. Pumped out the cell suspension to the harvest bottle 16:48 - 17:XX
  19. Took samples for imaging when there was approx 600 mL remaining in biostat 16:58
  20. Stopped data logging 17:30

NotesShould prepare all reagents in either 1000 mL or 500 mL bottles to match
the dip tube lengths of the lids on the long lines that reach between the BSC
and the 4-way addition port.  
  
Should add PTFE tubing to underside of 4-way port to direct liquid down the
side of the bioreactor for the extra-long tubes to prevent foaming during
liquid addition.  
  
Should shorten non-filtered harvest pipe to prevent buildup of microcarrier
under sparger.  
  
Should add poloxamer to culture medium to minimize microcarriers sticking and
to enable higher stir speeds.  
  
  
  
  




Recovered cell pellet and performed cell count

  1. Transferred 2 L of cell suspension to centrifuge tubes
  2. Centrifuged at 650 RCF for 5 minutes
  3. Aspirated the supernatants 17:35
  4. Resuspended the cells in 1 mL of fresh growth medium
  5. Combined the suspensions into 1 tube
  6. Washed down each tube in series with ~20 mL of fresh growth medium
  7. Gently combined and resuspended the cells with the wash
  8. Took a 10 uL aliquot
  9. Added 10 uL of Trypan blue solution to the aliquot
  10. Pipet mixed the cell suspension and Trypan blue, then performed live cell count by the Trypan blue exclusion method using phase contrast microscopy and an improved Neubauer hemocytometer.
    1. Average of 0.85 cells per mm2
    2. 0.85 x 10,000 x 4x dilution = 34,000 cells/mL
    3. 34,000 x 35 = 1,190,000 cells

Decontaminated bioreactor

  1. Added 100 mL of 70% ethanol to the feed, seed, microcarrier and harvest bottles
  2. Pumped the 70% ethanol through the tubing and into the bioreactor
  3. Pumped the remaining base from the base bottle into the bioreactor
  4.  ~~Cut off the tip of the sampling tube and discarded.~~
  5.  ~~Pumped 50 mL of 70% ethanol back through the sample tube.~~
  6. Disconnected and removed the pH probe:
    1. Wiped with 70% ethanol
    2. Rinsed with water
    3. Wiped with a lint-free cloth
    4. Filled the storage cap with3.5 M KCl
    5. Replaced the storage cap and stored the probe upright
  7. Disconnected and removed the DO probe:
    1. Wiped with 70% ethanol
    2. Rinsed with water
    3. Wiped with a lint-free cloth
    4. Filled the storage cap with tap water
    5. Replaced the storage cap and stored the probe upright
  8.  ~~Disconnected and removed the level probe:~~
    1.  ~~Wiped with 70% ethanol~~
    2.  ~~Rinsed with water~~
    3.  ~~Wiped with a lint-free cloth~~
    4.  ~~Stored the probe in a thickly-padded foam box~~
  9. Pumped the contents of the bioreactor into the waste bottle.
  10. Clamped all of the dip-tube lines
  11.  ~~Added bleach to the waste bottle to a final concentration of 5 g/L sodium hypochlorite (0.5% w/v)~~

Cleaned the bioreactor vessel

  1. Added pH neutral, non-corrosive, bacteriostatic cleaning agent to the bioreactor, filling all the way to the headplate.
    1. Add 20 mL of Sonidet detergent to 4 L of tap water
    2. Open the headplate
    3. Pour the water-detergent mix into the bioreactor
    4. Replace the headplate
    5. The level should reach the bottom of the headplate
  2. Left the stirrer on at 270 RPM overnight.
