Sample received by: Maddie Williams and Michael Medynskyj  
Date/Time sample received/opened: 10:15 am 25/Nov/2021  
Current temperature on data logger: 5.6 degrees C  
Observations:  

The tissue arrived in an esky that was sealed with packing tape (untampered).
There was no visible damage to the esky on arrival. Upon opening, the tissue
was found in a vacuum sealed wrap with no other gel packs or packaging in the
box. See photo attached below. The tissue was cold to the touch but not
frozen.

Location code of the fridge samples stored in prior to biopsy collection:

The tissue was placed inside fridge ID: 123 inside the esky that it arrived in
until taking the biopsies could begin.

Biopsy Process  
  
Preparing the tissue

  1. Selected the desired muscles to be targeted for each biopsy
  2. Removed sample from fridge 10:52
  3. Sprayed the tissue liberally with 70% ethanol and wiped clean with sterile gauze (accidentally dabbed with iodine prior to ethanol. Was only left on for a minute. then cleaned with ethanol step) 
  4. Pour a small volume (30-50 mL) of povidone iodine solution into a sterile kidney dish and dab a sterile gauze into the dish
  5. Use sterile forceps to dab the sample with the iodine soaked gauze. Once covered, allowed the iodine to sit for 5 minutes 10:08-10:13
  6. Repeated the iodine treatment 10: 17- 10: 22
  7. Dabbed away excess iodine using a fresh, sterile gauze

Taking the biopsies from the tissue

  1. Using sterile forceps and a sterile scalpel, cut a shallow (2-3 mm deep) outline of the area that is to be the source for the biopsy
  2. Carefully cut away the top layer of tissue inside the outline from the previous step
  3. Discarded the top layer of tissue
  4. Cut a cube of tissue from the biopsy site, roughly a minimum size of 10x10x10mm.
  5. Place the first biopsy into a 50 mL tube containing 10 mL dPBS + P/S to wash, and tightly close lid.
  6. Photographed the biopsy site  
  7. Repeated all steps above for each new biopsy 
  8. Transferred each sample to a 50mL tube containing 25mL DMEM/F12  \+ 10% FBS 1 x P/S 11:00

Results:

  * Results were;
    * [ ]  As Usual (this is a repetitive task)
    * [ ]  Unexpected because...
    * [X]  Need to be further analysed pending the results of the isolation of cells and whether there is contamination.
