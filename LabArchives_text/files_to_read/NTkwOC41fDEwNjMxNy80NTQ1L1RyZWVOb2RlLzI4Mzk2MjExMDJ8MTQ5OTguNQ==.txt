Aim/Purpose


To develop a OT2 protocol for feeding a 24 deep well plate and maintain
sterility during this process.


Hypothesis


We can successfully perform a 100% feed of a 24 deep well plate on OT2.

Using adhesive covers for a 24 deep well plate will allow us to maintain
sterility.


Technical Gap


We have not used 24 deep well plates for culturing cells before. Instead, we
have been using 50 mL shake tubes. Before we use these plates for growing
cells, we will need to create a OT2 protocol that makes it easy to perform
media changes when handling a high number of cultures.


Method/Procedure


  

  1. Calculate/find recommended volume and shaking speed for 24 well plate. Test this to see if fluid in the deep well is aggitating as expected.

  2. Measure plate and make labware definition. Dimensions can be found here:

  3. Design the protocol in protocol designer for a 100% feed and also for aliquoting a sample into 96 wp for staining.
  4. Perform a water run of the protocol.
  5. Perform a growth media run of the protocol. Growth media will not include Pen/Strep to make it easier to detect contamination if it does occur.
    1. Check cost of these media and use the cheaper option:
      1. CD-CHO + 10% KSR 
      2. DMEM/F12 + 10% FBS
  6. On 2-3 days after the feed, take samples for contamination testing.
    1. 10-20uL onto microscope slides. Check under the microscope for contamination. Follow this SOP.
    2. Take aliquots for T25 flask. Parafilm T25 flask in case it is contaminated.
  7. After the weekend (~approx 2 days later), check T25 flask for contamination.
