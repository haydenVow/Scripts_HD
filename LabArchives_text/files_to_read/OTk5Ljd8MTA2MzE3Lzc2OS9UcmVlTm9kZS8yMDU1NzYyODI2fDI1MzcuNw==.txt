Process

  1. Collected from "media & gelatin" fridge:
    1. 14 x 50 mL black centrifuge tubes (containing the 14 media conditions made in the previous lab book entry) 
  2. Added 2 mL of each media condition or E6 to wells of 4 x 24-well plates according to plate map below. Label these plates on the lid as BLOCK 1, BLOCK 2, BLOCK 3, and BLOCK 4 (again according to the plate map).  


  3. Transferred 4 x 24-well plates to incubator for at least 20 minutes. Timestamps:   

  4. Retrieved warmed aliquot of E6 from water bath. 
  5. Transferred 4 x 24-well plates (with warmed media) and 5 x culture plates (4 x 24-well plates) from Thermo incubator to BSC.   

  6. Using a well ethanol-sprayed hand, picked up HTS well insert tray of BLOCK 1 by the edge and transferred to the corresponding BLOCK 1 media plate. Use the lid from the culture plate for the new plate (to avoid having to re-print a culture label). 
  7. Repeated for BLOCKS 2-4. 
  8. Returned 4 x culture plates to the Thermo Incubator and discarded old plates with spent media.  MAKE SURE LIDS WITH BLOCK 1-4 LABEL REMAIN ON PLATES OR ARE RE-LABELLED.
