Protocol run:

Plate/s taken out from incubator: 15:58

Start run: 4:01:02 PM  

Run time: 1:06:46  

Plate/s returned to incubator: ~17:30  




Observations/Summary:

Passaged 24 wells from 96 wp to 24 wp. 40 min of tryle time was used for each
well.

The cells passaged were too confluent and forming sheets so they aren't
representative of cultures in our cloning pipeline but may be used to check
viability of cells after passage.

Dead volume remaining in 96 wp was checked for ~5 wells. It was between 20-30
uL approx.

There are some cells left behind  (see images).
