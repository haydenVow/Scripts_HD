Process


### Manually checked cells

  1. Removed the cells from the incubator and examine them under magnification for abnormalities
  2. Image all wells in Row B before returning the plate to the incubator and proceeding with XTT sample preparation.

XTT preparation (done in the dark)

  1. Removed the XTT assay kit from the -20 freezer 
  2. Removed 1 x package containing one bottle of XTT reagent and 1 x vials of the Electron coupling reagent from the CyQuant XTT Cell viability Assay kit, returned the rest of the kit to the freezer 
  3. Thawed the XTT reagents (component A) in the water bath at 37ºC, vortex the bottle to ensure the XTT reagent is fully in solution
  4. Thawed the Electron coupling reagents at room temperature. Vortex the vial to ensure that the reagent is fully in solution. 
  5. Prepared the working solution, removed 6 mL of XTT reagent and place it into a 15 mL tube.
  6. Add 1 mL of the electron coupling reagent in the 15 mL tube then mix the working solution by pipetting. Working solution should be used immediately.

Cell labelling and absorbance reading

  1. Immediately following sample preparation, removed well plate(s) from the incubator and added 70 uL (96-wp) or 35 uL (384-wp) of the working XTT solution directly to each test and blank well of the 96 well plate using a multichannel pipette.

  2. Incubated the wells at 37ºC for 4 hours. 13:30 - 

  3. After incubation, read the absorbance at 450 nm and 660 nm using the SPECTROstar Nano Absorbance Reader

    * Note: XTT specific absorbance is measured at 450nm, the 660 nm absorbance reading is used to eliminate background signal contributed by cell debris or other non specific absorbance.

  4. Cell concentrations in wells in each column were seeded at the following densities: [insert plate map]
