  1. Made up following aliquots:
    1. 20 mL Freestyle + nuvonis ingredients 
    2. 50/50 HyCell/RPMI + nuvonis ingredients (3mg/mL yeast) 
    3. 75/25 HyCell/RPMI + nuvonis ingredients (3mg/mL yeast)
  2. Placed in water bath 
  3. Retrieved cultures from incubator
  4. Took 2 x 50 uL samples from each culture 
  5. Performed 6 cell counts (2 per culture). Average cell counts:
    * Freestyle: 18,000,000
    * 50/50 RPMI/HyCell: 4,333,333
    * 75/25 RPMI/HyCell: 4,800,000
  6. Added averaged counts to spreadsheet (cell column titled "Nt Cell number at 't')") https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1G2Za0sUDijAQUpbmTaQbGTY74R04vCaQCKkvTalXIpE/edit#gid=0
  7. Transferred 5 mL containing 4.5M cells from Freestyle flask to fresh Freestyle media aliquot
  8. Centrifued 50/50 and 75/25 cultures and removed 100% of supernatants 
  9. Re-suspended pellets in fresh warmed medium containing 3mg/mL yeast 
  10. Moved all cultures to fresh E-125 flasks 
  11. Returned flasks to incubator
