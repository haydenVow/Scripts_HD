Media for BUFFY Muscle cells:  
  
Prepare E6 aliquots with and without creatine (380ml of each - 30ml per flask,
2x flasks per conc, with 6 media changes plus excess):  
  
NOTE \- CALCULATION BASED ON CREATINE WITH MW OF 131.13 (check tub!)  
  
NOTE \- Creatine is not a sterile powder, either add the respective powder
amount to each 380mls THEN sterile filter each 380mls OR filter the 2L of E6
first, aliquot into 5x 380mls and take 20mls from each, add the respective
creatine into the 20mls for each conc, then filter sterilise the 20mls with
creatine and add back to the respective remaining 360mls (with this method can
just use a syringe and filter).  
  
1\. Prepare 2L of E6 then aliqout into 5x 380mls  
  
2\. Add creatine to aliquots as follows (mix well) and label with
concentration details:  
  
0mM = 0g of creatine in 380ml diff media  
5mM = 0.25g of creatine in 380ml diff media  
12.5mM = 0.625g of creatine in 380ml diff media  
25mM = 1.25g of creatine in 380 mL diff media  
50mM = 2.5g of creatine in 380ml diff media  
  
Note - if 0.25g is too small to measure accurately then make up extra 50mM and
dilute 1 in 10  
  
3\. Store in fridge until use.

NOTE CALCULATION BASED ON CREATINE WITH MW OF 131.13 (check tub!)  
  
1\. Prepare 700ml of D/F+ 20% FBS + 1xP/S and aliquot into 5x140mls  
2\. Add creatine to aliquots as follows (mix well) and label with
concentration details:

0mM = 0g of creatine in 140ml D/F+ 20% FBS + 1xP/S

5mM = 0.09g of creatine in 140ml D/F+ 20% FBS + 1xP/S

25mM = 0.229g of creatine in 140ml D/F+ 20% FBS + 1xP/S

25mM = 0.459g of creatine in 140ml D/F+ 20% FBS + 1xP/S

50mM = 0.9179g of creatine in 140ml D/F+ 20% FBS + 1xP/S

  

  
Note - if 0.09g is too small to measure accurately then make up extra 50mM and
dilute 1 in 10.  
  
3\. Store in fridge until use.
