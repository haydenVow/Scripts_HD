Killing cells in control wells

N= 4 wells were exposed to ethanol to kill cells, and act as a positive
control for Dapi dead cell staining.

1\. Media aspirated from n=4 unstained wells  
2\. 70ul of 70% ethanol added to the wells.  
3\. plate left in the BSC with the lid off for 30 minutes to kill cells

13:50-14:20

4\. Ethanol aspirated from wells  
5\. Washed 2 x with 200ul PBS.  
6\. Proceeded to live Dapi staining protocol




Live Dapi staining protocol.

  
NOTE: Dapi staining concerntration reduced from 10ug/ml to 5ug/ml due to
persistent residual florescence seen up to 7 days post staining.  

  1. Prepared dapi stain by adding 20ul of Dapi to 4ml PBS   

  2. Removed culture medium fromall wells (N=16) in 96 well plate #6329 and replaced with 100ul/well Dapi/media mix.
  3.  Incubated at 37Â°C for 5 minutes, protected from light. 14:4-14:50
  4. Washed with 2x with 200ul PBS.  

  5. Replace with fresh PBS and image.  
  
Reagents  
Dapi:2193

Observations and Images

Ethanol exposure did not appear to kill the cells in the way planned. Instead,
it appears to have had the affect of fixing the cells.  
There was no distinct difference in the number, or brightness of stained
nuclei between conditions. Cells that were exposed to ethanol, are also
stained in the cytopplasm, illuminating the entire cell.
