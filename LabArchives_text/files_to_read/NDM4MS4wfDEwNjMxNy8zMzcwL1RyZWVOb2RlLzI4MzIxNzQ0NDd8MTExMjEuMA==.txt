### Process:

1\. Took image of vessel with microscope on phase setting.

3\. Aliquotted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then
placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath for a minimum of 20 minutes
prior to use:

  1. TrypLE:    42     mL in     1    tubes
  2.  dPBS (for neutralising):     2 x 3mL + 1 x 5mL + 1 x 10mL + 1 x 20mL    mL
  3.  dPBS (for washing):    2 x 3mL + 1 x 5mL + 1 x 10mL + 1 x 20mL      mL
  4. Growth media (for pellet resuspension):     12    mL
  5. Growth media (for seeding):    150     mL 

Time that all aliquots were placed in the water bath the warm before use
13:02 pm

Note: if aliquots were placed in water bath at different time, record the time
stamp for each individual solution.




4\. Removed vessel(s) from the incubator    13:32 pm

5\. Washed the vessel(s) with dPBS (warmed).

6\. Added     see above    mL tryple to each vessel/well and incubated at
37˚C.

  1. Start/Finish for TrypLE was    13 :45 (2 x T25s and 1x T75) - 14:10 pm 
  2. Start/Finish for TrypLE was    13 :49 (3 x T175s) - 14:06 pm 

  

7\. Neutralised with    see above      dPBS and combined cell suspension into
a     1 x tube per clone.

8\. Centrifuged at 650 x g for 5 min.

  1. Start/Finish time for centrifugation was   14:15 pm 




9\. Aspirated the supernatant(s).

10\. Resuspended pellet(s) in    see above     mL     Growth     media

11\. Aliquoted      10uL each    of resuspended cells into a microcentrifuge
tube for cell count.

12\. Performed a cell count using the haemocytometer and recorded the cell
count data in the Google Doc spreadsheet: Cell Count Spreadsheet or cell count
widget below

  1. Total cell number was:      see spreadsheet       




13\. Transferred      all   µl of 6H14 clone's cell suspension to the pre-
warmed      11     mL Growth media:  

14\. Transferred cell suspension into   1 x T75   vessel.

13\. Transferred      all   µl of 2O14 clone's cell suspension to the pre-
warmed      11     mL Growth media:  

14\. Transferred cell suspension into   1 x T75   vessel.

13\. Transferred      all   µl of 1A16 clone's cell suspension to the pre-
warmed      29     mL Growth media:  

14\. Transferred cell suspension into   1 x T175   vessel.

13\. Transferred      all   µl of 4C4 clone's cell suspension to the pre-
warmed      117     mL Growth media:  

14\. Transferred cell suspension into   4 x T175s   vessel.

13\. Transferred      110   µl of 3P23 clone's cell suspension to the pre-
warmed      5     mL Growth media:  

14\. Transferred cell suspension into   1 x T25   vessel.

15\. Left at RT in the BSC for 30 min to allow cells to settle      :  \-  :
a/pm  

16\. Transferred vessel(s) to incubate at:

  * [ ]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (avian cells)




12\. Centrifuge remaining 3P23 clone cells in 1 x 15mL tube at 650 x g for 5
min at RT    16:03 - 16:08 pm

13\. Aspirated supernatant carefully, taking care not to disturb the pellet.

14\. Resuspended the pellet in | 9 |mL freeze media (chilled, to reduce DMSO
toxicity).

15\. Aliquotted | 1000 |µL into | 9 | x cryovials (already labelled).

16\. Tightened the lids & transfer the cryovials to a Mr. Frosty immediately
into the -80ºC freezer.   :   pm

  * [ X ]  With foam
  * [ ]  Without foam
  * [ ]  1st Freeze
  * [ ]  2nd Freeze
  * [ ]  3rd Freeze
  * [ ]  4th Freeze
  * [ X ]  5th Freeze

17\. Allow the cells to freeze for at least 18-24 hours before transferring to
Liquid Nitrogen storage.
