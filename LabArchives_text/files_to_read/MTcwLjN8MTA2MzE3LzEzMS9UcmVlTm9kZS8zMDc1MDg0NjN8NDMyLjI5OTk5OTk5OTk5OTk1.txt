### Animal Component Free Media

Project Lead: Marie

Strategic Second: Ella

Primary Team: Avani, Derek, Michael

Additional support: Lily, Nathan

  

Desired outcome: Primary animal component free media from WCB to food

Goal: Develop an ACF process that promotes 10x doublings in suspension, >50%
scaffold adhesion, and >50% of cell fusion

  

April-- Milestone 1:

A. Determine baseline ACF adhesion, proliferation and harvest performance on
cytodex microcarriers, and adhesion to zein

B. Identify and order 5 components known to promote adhesion  

C. Identify any proliferation media ingredients that inhibit differentiation
and have started a 16 factor differentiation experiment #2

Key Result 1: Have baseline data for our top 3 ACF media formulations on
adhesion and proliferation to microcarriers and scaffolds.  

  

May-- Milestone 2:

A. Perform at least 2 harvests in ACF on cytodex microcarriers

B. Optimize ACF media to promote 50% adhesion to at least 1 scaffold

Key Result 2: Perform at least two (sequential) successful harvests on
microcarriers cultured in ACF media

Key Result 3: Optimise ACF media to promote >50% adhesion to at least one
scaffold

  

June-- Milestone 3:

A. Achieve 10x doublings in ACF on cytodex microcarriers

B. Optimize ACF media to promote 50% cell fusion on at least 1 scaffold

Key Result 4: Achieve 10x cell doublings in ACF media in suspension

Key Result 5: Optimise ACF media to promote >50% cell fusion on at least one
scaffold
