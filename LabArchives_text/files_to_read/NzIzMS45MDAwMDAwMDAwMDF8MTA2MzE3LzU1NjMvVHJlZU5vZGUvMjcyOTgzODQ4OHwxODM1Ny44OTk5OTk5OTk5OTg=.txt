Figure 1. Raw images of f-actin stain (488 channel) imaged of cells exposed to
either E6 or 2% HS (Horse serum) for 10 days of differentiation. Top wells
stained with 1:1000 Phalloidin-iFluor-488 for 20 minutes, and bottom wells
stained with the same stain for 30 minutes at room temperature. Images are
representative of replicates (n = 4 per group) regarding stain intensity.








Figure 2. Merge of fluorescent labelling of F-Actin (Green), Myosin heavy
chain (Red) and DAPI (Blue). Images taken at 10x magnification, and stitched
together with mia stitcher.
