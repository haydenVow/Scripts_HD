### Process:

1\. Took image of vessel with microscope on phase setting.

2\. Gelatin coated 6x T175 vessel with sterile filtered 0.1% gelatin solution
and then incubated all coated flasks at 37˚C.  

  1. Time when all vessels(s) placed into the incubator     3:58-4:58  

3\. Aliquotted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then
placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath for a minimum of 20 minutes
prior to use:

  1. TrypLE:  3x 20 mL  

  2.  dPBS 3x40mL   

  3. Growth media (for seeding):  3x 60 mL (for seeding T175) + 30 uL p38i, 2x 6.72 mL (for seeding 96-well plate) + 3.36 uL p38i  

Time that all aliquots were placed in the water bath the warm before use
17:06

Note: if aliquots were placed in water bath at different time, record the time
stamp for each individual solution.




PASSAGE - 6XT175

4\. Removed vessel(s) from the incubator    18:25

5\. Washed the vessel(s) with dPBS (warmed).

6\. Added      10   mL tryple to each vessel/well and incubated at 37˚C.

  1. Start for TrypLE was  18:35-18:45

7\. Neutralised with     10mL     dPBS and combined cell suspension into a
50mL     tube.

8\. Centrifuged at 650 x g for 5 min.

  1. Start/Finish time for centrifugation was   18:58-19:03   




BUFFY PASSAGE - 6XT175

9\. Aspirated the supernatant(s).

10\. Resuspended pellet(s) in     1 mL    Growth      media

11\. Aliquoted      10uL    of resuspended cells into a microcentrifuge tube
for cell count.

12\. Performed a cell count using the haemocytometer and recorded the cell
count data in the Google Doc spreadsheet: Cell Count Spreadsheet or cell count
widget below

  1. Total cell number was:   BUFFY    644,000  C2C12  760,000    DOLLY  1,372,000     

  2. Volume of cell suspension required for subculture was:         
BUFFY   12 uL for 96-well plate, 543 uL for 2xT175s  C2C12 461 uL for 2xT175s
DOLLY  6 uL for 96-well plate, 255 uL for 2xT175s  

  3. Cell density per vessel:     500/cm2      




BUFFY PASSAGE - 4XT175

13\. Transferred      As above     µl of cell suspension to the pre-warmed
growth media

14\. Transferred cell suspension into the pre-gelatin coated      2xT175s, 1x
96-well plate (for BUFFY and DOLLY) and 2xT175s (For C2C12)   vessels

15\. Left at RT in the BSC for 30 min to allow cells to settle   20:00-20:30  

16\. Transferred vessel(s) to incubate at: 20:30

  * [X]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (avian cells)
