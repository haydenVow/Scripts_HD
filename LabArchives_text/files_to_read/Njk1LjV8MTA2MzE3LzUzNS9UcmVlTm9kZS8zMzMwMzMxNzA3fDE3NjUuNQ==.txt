RELATED TO MILESTONE: Milestone 1B: Have the first biomaterials DoE designed
and underway

AIM/PURPOSE: To use a DSD to assess which ECM ingredient media combination and
scaffold coating has a positive impact on scaffold confluence/adhesion
maintenance during the differentiation of MuSCs on our in-house zein scaffolds  

HYPOTHESIS: We will identify at least one ingredient and one coating
combination that promotes adhesion maintenance during the differentiation
stage of cells on zein scaffolds

RESULTS SUMMARY:

CONCLUSIONS: It was found that EPL had a significant positive impact on cell
adhesion to zein, relative to pectin by day 7 in differentiation media. In
five separate media conditions ACF media promoted better MuSC adhesion to zein
than the serum-containing media. The ACF media control (no ECM components)
with EPL coating was on par with the best performing ECM condition, however
conditions 11, 3 and 5 were more consistent between replicates.

NEXT STEPS:

  * EPL coating and ACF media will be used moving forward in cultures with zein scaffolds  
  * A future experiment will be designed to compare EPL and non-coated zein with ACF (baseline experiment suggests EPL improves adhesion) and to verify the effects of conditions, 3,5 11on cell adhesion maintenance
