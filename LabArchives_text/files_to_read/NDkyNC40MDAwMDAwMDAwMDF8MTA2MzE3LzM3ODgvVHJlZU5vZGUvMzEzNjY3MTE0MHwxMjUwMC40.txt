Results and analysis of key events:

During seeding

  * During seeding, a lot of bubbles were formed when mixing the cell suspension with the collagen gel. It is not certain if this had an impact on cell viability or imaging. 

  

After seeding

  * During the first feed after seeding, the media was yellow in colour for cell containing samples . This is a result of the high seeding density.
  * There were many cells that adhered to the base of the well instead of the gel. 

No insert sample with cells adhered to the base of the well  
  
Collagen plate 24 hours after seeding - pin insert, conical insert, no insert
and control, based on rows.



  * 24 hours after seeding the samples had not contracted, however after the first change into E6 media, the cell containing samples contracted. 
    * The cell containing without any inserts contracte into a ball 
    * The cell containing samples with pin inserts began to contract, with those that were not fully attached to both legs of the pins, contracting and forming a ball on one leg of the pin. 
    * The cell containing samples seeded on the conical insert contracted and around the staff/ pole in the center, forming a ring.

  * Upon examination under phase microscopy, it was evident which samples contained cells, and which didn't. The cell containing had small round bubble like surface on and within the entire gel, whilst the control appeared semi- transparent. Control samples also had obvious bubbles scattered throughout the gel.



CMFDA stain

  * 24 hours after seeding, a non insert cell containing sample was sacrificed for staining with CMFDA. The stain showed that there was cells still alive and embedded within the gel matrix.

in prolif growth media)

  * After 2 days in E6 media, CMFDA stain on cell containing non - insert collagen sample showed that there were still live cells. Furthermore, there appeared to be some cells differentiating, evident through the elongated stained cells.

MyoG, MF20, DAPI stain

Day 6 stain  (9th and 10th)

  * The images obtained from the fluorescent stains for MF20 and MyoG were difficult to see. Due to the transparent nature of the gel, there is a lot of background exposure from the unfocused cells that were stained. Therefore the images may appear to have large blurry bright spots with not well defined individual cells.  
  * At day 6, the collagen sample shows that there are many cells present within the gel. Furthermore, cells have begun to differentiate (green fluorescent) and form myotubes (red fluorescent)

Collagen pin insert Day 6 \- MyoG, MF20, DAPI

  * Due to the DAPI images being over-exposed, the image was not included in the bellow image. This gives us a better view of the MyoG and MF20 stain. 
  * We are able to see that the cells have differentiated and formed some myotubes at day 6 in the no insert cell containing sample. 
  * Also evident in pin inserts

Day 14 stain (17th)

  * For the fluorescent images taken from the zaber on the day 14 stain, images appear over-exposed. This is due to the incorrect setting used for the collagen gel. When samples were images using the zaber, the fibrin gel was the first sample that appeared in the plate and therefore the exposure and focus settings were adjusted for the fibrin sample only. It was not taken into consideration that the collagen sample would require a different setting. Therefore all the images for the collagen sample appeared over-exposed and no conclusion can be drawn from those images, except that there were cells present.
