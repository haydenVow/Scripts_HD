### Media preparation:  
  

  1. Aliquotted growth media conditions. Growth factors and KSR (except for Brutus media) are to be added fresh as indicated :   2 x 45 mL aliqouots, 2x 15 mL aliquots

Note: if aliquots were placed in water bath at different time, record the time
stamp for each individual solution.




Process:  

  1. Collected E125s from shaker, wiped with ethanol-sprayed Rediwipe, and brought into BSC
  2. Using a 25 mL serological pipette, gently pipette-mixed culture for 1 minute to break up cell clumps
  3. Transfer suspension into 50 mL tubes. Kept E125 vessels in BSC, as culture will be returned to this vessel after feed. 
  4. Centrifuged 50 mL tubes at 300 x g for 5 min
  5. Washed flasks with 10 mL of dPBS
  6. Aspirated  75% (30 mL) of supernatant, taking extra care to not disrupt or aspirate pellet. 
  7. Topped up each 50 mL centrifuge tube with 15 mL of fresh prewarmed media and resuspended cell pellet. 
  8. Gently pipette-mixed cultures, and returned to e125 flask
  9. Took 100 uL samples from each culture and loaded onto a 96 well plate according to the plate map. 
  10. Returned E125s to incubator

Staining

Prepared dead stain solution in amber/black centrifuge tube:  
\- 1 mL dPBS  
\- 1 drop Nucgreen AF488 dead stain  
\- Vortex for 5 seconds to mix

Prepared Hoechst stain (50 ug/mL) solution in amber/black centrifuge tube:  
\- 9500 uL MilliQ  
\- 500 uL Hoechst Trihydrochloride trihydrate (1mg/mL)  
\- Vortex for 5 seconds to mix. Solution can be stored at 4°C for up to 6
months

  1. Added 20 uL of Hoechst stain directly to cells
  2. Added 80 uL of dead stain solution (dPBS+Nucgreen) to cells
  3. Incubated for 30 minutes in the dark at room temperature 14:50-15:20
  4. Made 4x, 8x and 16x dilutions of the sample in dPBS 
  5. Centrifuged plates at 300 RCF for 1 minute 15:40  
  

  6. Prepared plate map: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ASbnbEItUh6-UgF-I489BIPcyPtFimxHqnAKLWFhtOI/edit?usp=drive_web&ouid=112350845195625657554

Observations/Summary:

culture ID 9650 was tipped over in the incubator when we arrived so we tossed
it :(
