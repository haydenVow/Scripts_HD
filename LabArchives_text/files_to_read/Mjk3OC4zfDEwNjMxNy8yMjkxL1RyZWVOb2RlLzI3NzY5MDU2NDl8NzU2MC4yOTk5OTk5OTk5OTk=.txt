Process:

1\. Aliquotted   1mL  mL of  both E6 and HS diff media into  separate
15mL/1.5mL   tube(s). Placed them in the water bath   12:15-13:00  

NOTE: Growth media's can be found in fridge 104 in the library lab. E6 should
be in a 15mL tube and 2% horse serum diff media should be in a 250mL
container.

2\. Inspected the E6 treated wells on the remaining plates for any evidence of
cell death, recorded observations.

2.5. Removed  100 % of supernatant wells B2-B4 and C2-C4 on each 96 well
plate.   13:00  

3\. Added E6 diff media (200uL) to Wells B2-B4 on each plate and Horse serum
diff media to wells C2-C4 on each plate. Left wells D2-D4 untouched.

4\. Returned vessel to incubate at:   13:06  

  * [x]  37ÂºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * Incubator (#78, Library Lab).
