Process:

1\. Aliquotted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then
placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath for a minimum of 20 minutes
prior to use:

  1. TrypLE:    15   mL in   1x 15 mL    tube
  2. dPBS (for neutralising)    30   mL in    1x 50 mL   pot
  3. Growth media (for pellet resuspension):    2   mL in    5x 15 mL   tubes for each condition
  4. Growth media (for seeding):    12   mL in    5x 15 mL   tubes 15:00
  5. Times that all aliquots were placed in the water bath to warm before use  14:43 

Note: if aliquots were placed in water bath at different times, record the
time stamp for each individual solution.




2\. Washed the flask(s) with dPBS.

3\. Added    3   mL tryple to each vessel/well and incubated at 37˚C for    15
min.

Note: Fibroblasts typically require 15-18 minutes of incubation with tryple,
slightly longer than MuSCs.

  1. Start/Finish time for tryple was  15:05  \-  15:20   

4\. Neutralised with    3 mL   dPBS (warmed) and combined cell suspension into
a    5x 15 mL   tube.

5\. Centrifuged at 650 x g for 5 min

  1. Start/Finish time for centrifugation was  15:33  \-  15:38 




6\. Aspirated the supernatant(s)

7\. Resuspended pellet(s) in      2  mL    respective growth   media.

8\. Performed a cell count using the haemocytometer and recorded the cell
count data in the Google Doc spreadsheet called 'Cell Count Spreadsheet' (see
link below):

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1DPzKubYxfHmWogVPihC-
SSIBtIylyrBQE5kRX5Z8NtI/edit#gid=0

9\. Total cell number was

  1. Total cell number (serum control) was:     2,448,000          
  2.  Total cell number (DMEM/F12 only) was:     60,000      

  3.  Total cell number (E8) was:     1,704,000      

  4.  Total cell number (E8 10C) was:     1,908,000      

  5.  Total cell number (E8 + goodies) was:    1,560,000      




10\. Seeded ~7k cells per cm2 of the flasks/plates. Note that fibroblasts
prefer to be subcultured closely together.

11\. Volume of cell suspension required for subculture was:

  1. Serum control was:    429 uL    
  2. DMEM/F12 only) was:     2.5 mL      

  3. E8 was:     616 uL     

  4. E8 10C was:     550 uL     

  5. E8 + goodies was:    673 uL     

12\. Transfer   required amount of cell suspension to the pre-warmed  12 mL
Growth Media.

13\. Transfer cell suspension into (non-gelatin coated)     5x T25    flasks.

14\. Transfer flask/plate(s) to incubate at:

  * [x]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (aviary cells)
