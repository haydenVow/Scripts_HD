Preparation:

  1. No autoclaving necessary. All work completed outside the BSC.
  2. Inlet and outlet steel tubing as well as the gas sparging tube were inserted into the Bioreactor (WASHe) through drilled and grommet-equipped holes in the reactor lid
  3. 1 additional hole with a filter-capped tube was used as a sterile pressure release valve
  4.  pH probe and DO probe holes were drilled to accomodate the diameter of the respective sensors

Test parameters:

  1.  test typical baseline dissolved oxygen levels (11%?) and a "hyperbaric" condition with high oxygen content
  2. establish required CO2 pp to maintain ph at physiological conditions

Tom, any recommendations for what dissolved oxygen to aim, for for maturation
bioreactor testing? What are you doing in the Biostat?

I`m thinking it may benefit maturation to have more oxygen, there are some
articles on muscle growth under hyperbaric conditions but I want to try a
typical level first. what ratio of air to CO2 are you feeding into the
biostat?
