## Feed performed by: Shaleen Sharma  




Growth Media:

  * [X ]  DMEM/F12 + 20% FBS + 1X P/S
  * [X ]  DMEM/F12 + 20% FBS + 1X P/S + 1:100 Anti-clumping agent
  * [X ]  DMEM/F12 + 20% FBS + 1X P/S + 1:500 Anti-clumping agent
  * [X ]  DMEM/F12 + 20% FBS + 1X P/S + 1:100 RevitaCell

  

  

Media are aliquotted in 10mL aliquots in fridge #104 of Library Lab




Process:

1\. Place the pre-aliquotted  10 mL  mL of each respective type of Growth
Media into the water bath     07:27 am

Take observations (below) of the 4 x shake tubes in incubator #67. Stop
shaking platform to collect tubes and then restart after returning tubes to
tube rack

2\. Placed shake tubes in centrifuge and centrifuge at 650 x g for 5 min at
RT.     08:27 am

Aspirated supernatant from each pellet *Note, allow a buffer of ~0.5mL to
ensure no cells are aspriated

Added 1mL of respective growth media to each tube and used a P1000 pipette to
break up cell clumps. (pipette up and down ~10 times)

Remaining 9mL of each respective media was added afterwards and triturated
with 10mL serological pipette to break up cell clumps for each culture further
and resuspend cells evenly.

4\. Returned vessel to incubate at:    08:56 am  Shaking at 206 RPM

  * [X ]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (aviary cells)

  

  * Incubator (#67 ), Lab [Library]




  

Observations:

Upon collecting the tubes from the shaking platform, tubes were observed.  
Any clumps / aggregates / cloudy suspension / other observations?

\---

1:100 anti-clumping - Clear solution - no cloudy nature observed.

1:500 anti-clumping -  Clear solution - no cloudy nature observed. Very small
clump/aggregate observed at the very bottom of tube

1:100 RevitaCell - Clear solution - no cloudy nature observed. Small
clump/aggregate observed at the very bottom of tube

Serum control -  Clear solution - no cloudy nature observed. Small
clump/aggregate observed at the very bottom of tube

*All tubes have thin white discs/rings - likely to be residue/markings from previous centrifuge pellets when spun down?

  

Observations during process:

\- Cell pellet/aggregates were hard to completely break apart despite
triturating 10 times with both P1000 and 10mL Serological
