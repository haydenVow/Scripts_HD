Summary  
  
'Raw isolate' starting population  
It became clear when compiling data for this report that the 'raw isolate'
cells which were used for this expansion had already been pre-plated and
expanded. These cells were previously expanded to 32M cells before being
banked. Under Vows current procedures for cell expansion, these 'raw isolate'
vials would be considered an MCB as the population had already been enriched
for plastic adherent cells, expanded, and frozen down. Therefore, by the time
these cells reach WCB stage, they will have undergone an additional freeze
cycle.  
  
MCB bank  
A total of 11 million cells were banked as an MCB in 11x vials. Their IDS are
listed below.

WCB expansion  
The expansion from MCB to WCB was terminated at day 14 after passage 6 due to
the large number of dead cells in the cultures, as well as the senescent
morphology of cells. It is unclear why this occurred, however the most likely
reason is that the cells reached their replicative capacity.

Seeding density  
It is notable that cells were sometimes seeded bellow the recommended
7000-7500 cells/cm for fibroblasts. It is unclear from our limited data if
this has affect proliferation rates.

Future action  
As we did not see obvious signs of cell death prior to p6, we are unsure if
this is an anomaly or if the cells reached their proliferative capacity. It
was therefore decided to repeat the expansion from MCB to WCB, the lab book
