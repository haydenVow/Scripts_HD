Preparation


Equilibrate microcarriers in culture medium before use (E500)  

  1. Prior to use, aliquotted | 28.125 | mL of sterilized microcarriers ( 20 g/L stock) suspended in dPBS into |  1 |  x | E500  | flasks.
  2. Rinsed microcarriers in | 30 | mL culture medium (50 mL/g Cytodex). (this rinse reduces dilution of the culture medium by PBS trapped between and within the microcarriers, which is particularly important when using small culture volumes or cells with low plating efficiencies).
  3. The microcarriers were then allowed to settle and as much supernatant as possible was removed.
  4. The microcarriers were resuspended to the desired volume of culture medium ( | 120 | mL ) in each vessel.
  5. The culture vessel was transferred to the incubator for at least 1 hour or overnight so that the microcarriers and culture medium could equilibrate. |   10:00 am 21/06/21 | 
    * 37 degrees, 5% CO2, Incubator #  |  67 |  

The flask with microcarriers, growth media and p38i was parafilmed and put in
fridge 105 library lab for later use after staining/imaging revealed the cells
required longer to grow  |   12:34 pm 21/06/21 |

The culture vessel was transferred to the incubator overnight so that the
microcarriers and culture medium could equilibrate |   12:20 pm 22/06/21 |

  




Equilibrate microcarriers in culture medium before use (E250)  

  1. Prior to use, aliquotted | 14 | mL of sterilized microcarriers ( 20 g/L stock) suspended in dPBS into |  1 |  x | E250  | flasks.
  2. Rinsed microcarriers in | 15 | mL culture medium (50 mL/g Cytodex). (this rinse reduces dilution of the culture medium by PBS trapped between and within the microcarriers, which is particularly important when using small culture volumes or cells with low plating efficiencies).
  3. The microcarriers were then allowed to settle and as much supernatant as possible was removed.
  4. The microcarriers were resuspended to the desired volume of culture medium ( | 60 | mL ) in each vessel.

  2. Allow the microcarriers to settle for at least 2 minutes   11:12   

  3. Gently tilt the flask to an angle of approximately 30 degrees from vertical
  4. Remove the cap and aspirate the supernatant using a serological pipet - keep the tip only 5-10 mm below the surface during this procedure
  5. Transfer half of the fresh, pre-warmed dPBS (15mL) for E135 and (30mL) for E250 for prewashing to the flask using a serological pipet - wash down the insides to wash any stuck microcarriers back into the bulk suspension, then replace the cap

  




## Second wash to remove serum:

  1. Allow the microcarriers to settle for at least 2 minutes   11:20   

  2. Gently tilt the flask to an angle of approximately 30 degrees from vertical
  3. Remove the cap and aspirate the supernatant using a serological pipet - keep the tip only 5-10 mm below the surface during this procedure
  4. Transfer the remaining half of the fresh, pre-warmed dPBS for prewashing to the flask using a serological pipet - wash down the insides to wash any stuck microcarriers back into the bulk suspension, then replace the cap

  




## Add detachment agent:

  1. Allow the microcarriers to settle for at least 2 minutes   : 
  2. Gently tilt the flask to an angle of approximately 30 degrees from vertical
  3. Remove the cap and aspirate the supernatant using a serological pipet - keep the tip only 5-10 mm below the surface during this procedure
  4. Transfer the fresh, pre-warmed Trypsin/EDTA/Poloxomer 188 solution to the flask using a serological pipet - wash down the insides to wash any stuck microcarriers back into the bulk suspension, then replace the cap.

  




## Incubate flask:

  1. Stop the shaker
  2. Remove the flask from the BSC and transfer it back to the shaker
  3. Restart the shaker at the speed   210  rpm  see the table below.   11:33 (E250) 11:35 (E125)

## Sample and stain 7233 and 7234 (seeding):

  1. Aliquotted 10uL of culture from each flask after swirling evenly to distribute carriers into 5 wells per flask (5 replicates per flask).
  2. Added 90uL of non sterile dPBS to each well.
  3. Added 2uL of Hoescht stain to each well and mixed stain evenly using P200 pipette ensuring no bubbles are formed in the process.\
  4. Incubated plate in the dark for 15 mins at RT:   16:30 - 16:45   

  5. Imaged using the Axio in the main lab.  17:15   




Observations/Summary:

Successful passage of microcarriers completed. However, the harvest yield was
lower than desired so the flask sizes remained the same post passage. This was
not unexpected, since the images pre harvest indicated very slow cell growth
over many days. Thus the diff assay for the microcarrier derived cells was
again not seeded out.  
  
The Taipan V3 was used, with the new 3D printed heads. This was successful for
the first taipan used but the second taipan let a large number of
microcarriers through, indicating a hole in the filter or compromised
construction of the filter head. This taipan was marked for later inspection.
