### Process:

1\. Took 2x image of vessel with microscope on phase setting at 4X and 10X
magnification.

3\. Aliquotted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then
placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath for a minimum of 20 minutes
prior to use:

  1. TrypLE:    3     mL in     1    tubes
  2.  dPBS (for washing and neutralising):     6  mL
  3. Growth media (for pellet resuspension and seeding):     6   mL 

Time that all aliquots were placed in the water bath the warm before use
16:00-16:10  

media: 16:00 - 16:50  

Note: if aliquots were placed in water bath at different time, record the time
stamp for each individual solution.




4\. Removed vessel(s) from the incubator     16:08  

5\. Washed the vessel(s) with dPBS (warmed).

6\. Added     3    mL tryple to each vessel/well and incubated at 37˚C.

  1. Start/Finish for TrypLE was    16:18  \- 16:36    .   

7\. Neutralised with    3 mL   dPBS and combined cell suspension into a    15
mL     tube for each flask.

8\. Centrifuged at 650 x g for 5 min.

  1. Start/Finish time for centrifugation was     16:42   \-   16:47     




9\. Aspirated the supernatant(s).

10\. Resuspended pellet(s) in    1    mL for clone 4C4 using    growth
media  

11\. Aliquoted      10 uL    of resuspended cells into a microcentrifuge tube
for cell count.

12\. Performed a cell count using the haemocytometer and recorded the cell
count data in the Google Doc spreadsheet: Cell Count Spreadsheet or cell count
widget below

  1. Total cell number was: 
    1. 4C4:      398,000 cells       

  2. Volume of cell suspension required for subculture was: 
    1. 4C4:        441uL     

  3. Cell density per vessel:     175 000 cells per flask (7000 cells/cm^2)  
  4. Record cell numbers in this spreadsheet too to calculate doubling time: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1V8awnFZCaKBzbKTSFXCdy3iZd4wFAyTEWebNI-N1Lko/edit#gid=1008617076  




13\. Transferred    175 000 cells to the pre-warmed      5     mL Growth
media:  

14\. Transferred cell suspension into        1x T25    for the clone.

16\. Transferred vessel(s) to incubate at:    17:20  

  * [X]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells), incubator #78  

  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (avian cells)




Observations/Summary:

One DOLLY_12 fibroblast clone was passaged. There appears to be a lot of cell
debris, yet there was a large proportion of adhered cells observed under the
microscope, prior to passage.
