Protocol


  

  1. 1 scaffold per condition removed and added to 24 WP for imaging. 3 times at 4x and 10 magnification each.
  2. 4 mLs removed from each well using a pipette.
  3. 4 mLs of fresh RPMI/HyCell 50:50  OR DMEM/F12 + 20% FBS added to each well with a serological pipette.
  4. Incubated.

Observations


After a 100% feed on 01 JUL 22, media seems to have been completely used. Will
need to keep to 50% daily feeds or larger wells.

Images were taken by transferring one scaffold from each condition to a 12 WP.
The low alginate conditions had seems reverted back to a sol form rather than
a crosslinked hydrogel, as the structure had collapsed and was exceptionally
soft and could not be handled. This was present in the no cell condition,
suggesting that calcium ahs leached out of the matrix into the media and
washed away leading to structural collapse. Medium alginate conditions
maintained structural integrity across the board.

Cells appeared to have proliferated into clusters throughout the gels in all
conditions. In suspension conditions this was more evident, while adherent
appeared to migrate more throughout the gel and leading to a more spreading
out appearance as opposed to clusters.
