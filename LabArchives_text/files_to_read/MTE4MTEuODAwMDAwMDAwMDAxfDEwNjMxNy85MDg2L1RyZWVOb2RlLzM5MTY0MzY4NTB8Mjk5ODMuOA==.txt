Performed a 50% Feed on all chomp cultures (4xT175 flasks containing DMEM/F12
+ 10% FBS + 1xP/S adapted chomp cells, 2xT175 flasks containing 20% FBS
adapted Chomp cells).  
  
Removed 15mL of media from each flask and added 15mL of respective fresh
media.  
  
The same DMEM/F12 + 20% FBS + 1xP/S batch was used to feed the 10% Serum
adapted cells, however the media was diluted with a DMEM/F12 + 1xP/S mix to
the desired 10% serum content before being fed to the cells.
