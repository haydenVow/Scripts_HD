## 1\. Background

Transferrin is a universal iron carrier capable of delivering iron to cells.
It can be utilised to increase the quantity and quality of a wide range of
cell types. Transferrin is also associated with the innate immune system,
since its binding of iron can create decreased levels of free iron and impede
bacterial survival.

The preparation of Transferrin aliquots is to be performed in a Biological
Safety Cabinet. General lab PPE is required, including face mask, hair net,
gloves, and lab coat.

  5. 1 x Syringe filter unit
  6. Sterile microtubes 




## 8\. Method/Procedure (suitable for Biogems Cat# 10-366)

Note: Please perform this procedure with the BSC light turned off. Growth
factors are often sensitive to light exposure.  

  1. Calculate the volume of 0.5% albumin in dPBS solution required to create a 100 mg/mL stock solution of Transferrin. 
  2. Prepare the solution of 0.5% albumin in sterile dPBS in a sterile falcon tube in the BSC. 
  3. Retrieve stock powder from storage location (Transferrin powder is kept at -20 degrees C).
  4. Using a microfuge, centrifuge the vial containing Transferrin powder for 10 seconds and then transfer the vial to the BSC.
  5. Using a micropipette, transfer 0.5% albumin in dPBS solution from the falcon tube to the stock vial to reconstitute the powder to a concentration of 1.0 mg/mL. Pipette mix thoroughly and smoothly to dissolve the stock powder, taking care not to spill any of the solution.
  6. Transfer the entire aliquot back to the falcon tube containing 0.5% albumin in dPBS. Repeat steps 5 - 6 at least three more time to ensure that the entire amount of powder is dissolved.
    * Note: Transferrin powder takes a while to dissolve - do not be surprised if it seems very clumpy at first and it takes a while to fully wash out of the vial. 
  7. Check the vial to ensure that there is no powder left. If any powder remains, repeat step 8 until the vial is clean.
  8. Using a serological pipette, carefully mix the solution to ensure a homogenous mix (do not vortex!) 
  9. Pour or pipette solution into a syringe filter unit and filter into a new sterile falcon tube.
  10. Transfer the solution into sterile microtubes. Remember to add at least 5 uL to your desired aliquot volume to account for loss of liquid from pipetting. 
  11. Enter details in Stockyard V2 under "Create Mix".
  12. Place aliquots into an appropriately sized container (e.g. cryobox, 500 mL sterile pot) and stick Stockyard label on the container. Add a note of the volume per aliquot for future users. 
  13. Store in - 20 degrees C freezer.
