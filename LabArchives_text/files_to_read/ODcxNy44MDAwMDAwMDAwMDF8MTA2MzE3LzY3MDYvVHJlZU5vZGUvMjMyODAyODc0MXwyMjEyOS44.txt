### Process:

1\. Took image of vessel with microscope on phase setting.

2\. Gelatin coated  2x T175 vessel with sterile filtered 0.1% gelatin solution
and then incubated all coated flasks at 37˚C.  

  1. Time when all vessels(s) placed into the incubator    15:16   

3\. Aliquotted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then
placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath for a minimum of 20 minutes
prior to use:

  1. TrypLE:  20 mL  

  2.  dPBS 40 mL  

  3. Growth media (for seeding):  1x 60 mL  

Time that all aliquots were placed in the water bath the warm before use
15:31

Note: if aliquots were placed in water bath at different time, record the time
stamp for each individual solution.




C2C12 PASSAGE - 2XT175

4\. Removed vessel(s) from the incubator    18 : 35  pm

5\. Washed the vessel(s) with dPBS (warmed).

6\. Added      10   mL tryple to each vessel/well and incubated at 37˚C.

  1. Start for TrypLE was   16:25  pm 

7\. Neutralised with     10mL     dPBS and combined cell suspension into a
50mL     tube.

8\. Centrifuged at 650 x g for 5 min.

  1. Start/Finish time for centrifugation was   16:39  




C2C12 PASSAGE - 2XT175

9\. Aspirated the supernatant(s).

10\. Resuspended pellet(s) in     8    mL    Growth      media   16:48  

11\. Aliquoted      10uL    of resuspended cells into a microcentrifuge tube
for cell count.

12\. Performed a cell count using the haemocytometer and recorded the cell
count data in the Google Doc spreadsheet: Cell Count Spreadsheet or cell count
widget below

  1. Total cell number was:       23,040,000      

  2. Volume of cell suspension required for subculture was:    76 Ul      

  3. Cell density per vessel:     500/cm2      




BUFFY PASSAGE - 4XT175

13\. Transferred      As above     µl of cell suspension to the pre-warmed
60 Ml    mL Growth media:     16:58

14\. Transferred cell suspension into the pre-gelatin coated      2xT175s
vessel.

15\. Left at RT in the BSC for 30 min to allow cells to settle     17:01 -
17:31  

16\. Transferred vessel(s) to incubate at:

  * [X]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (avian cells)




Observations/Summary:

Passage supposed to be for BUFFY6 and C2C12, but upon observation of C2C12
flasks prior to passage, AW saw they looked more primary like and density was
very low, whereas the BUFFY6 flasks were virtually fully confluent. As such,
only passaged flasks labelled BUFFY and left C2C12 flasks in culture. Need to
check cells 8.2.22

  

After discussion with Bec Screnci, we (AW + RS) concluded that there was a
mislabelling - AW proceed with C2C12 and thaw more BUFFY
