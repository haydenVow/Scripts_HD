1\. Prepared    12 mL  PBST (0.2% Triton-X)

2\. Prepared   12 mL  blocking buffer: PBST (0.1% Triton-X + PBS) + 3% bovine
serum albumin (BSA). (Kept in the fridge until needed in blocking step)

3\. Prepared Primary Antibody Mix:  80 µL   Primary #1 MyoG (Santa Cruz)
(1:200  ) +  320 uL µL   Primary #2 MF20 (DSHB)   (1:50  ) +  16 mL Blocking
Buffer

Vortexed antibody mix for 5 seconds and stored refrigerated away from light
until needed.

Process:

Fix

1\. Remove media

2\. Wash Twice with PBS

a. 13:58- 14:04

b 14:04 - 14:09

3\. Add PFA for 15 minutes  14:10 - 14:25 pm  

4\. Remove PFA and wash with PBS for five minutes  14:27 - 14:32 pm

Permeabilise

1\. Removed PBS from each well.

2\. Added  500 µL PBST (0.2% Triton-X) to each well for 15 min:  14:40 - 14:55
pm

3\. Aspirated PBST for each well.




Blocking

1\. Added  500 µL of blocking buffer (3% BSA in PBST [0.1% Triton-X]) and
incubate for 45 minutes - 1hr at RT. (no more than 1 hour):   15:03 - 15:48 pm




Single/Simultaneous Primary Antibody staining

1\. Removed blocking buffer from each well.

2\. Incubated cells with primary antibody for 90min - 2hrs at RT, or 4ºC
overnight:   15:48

3\. Parafilmed plates and stored at 4ºC in tissue culture lab Fridge.

After this step, all further task should be performed in a dark room. The
vessel should also be wrapped foil when not used.
