Aim/Purpose


1\. To expand our MCB F_NANDO3 cells to a WCB of >100M cells


Hypothesis


1\. Continuous culture of our plastic adherent F_NANDO3  cells will allows us
to bank >100m million cells as a WCB.

  


Technical Gap


1\. F_NANDO3  is a chicken biopsy recently isolated by Vow. As these cells
have yet to be expanded to WCB, we have no prior indication of the health and
proliferative capacity of these cells.

  

  


Method/Procedure


Experimental Plan  
  
1\. Thaw F_NANDO3 MCB  

  * Warm an aliquot of DMEM/F12 + 10% FBS + 1x PS (growth media). 
  * 1 x vial of frozen F_NANDO3 MCB will be thawed and plated into 1x 6 well plate. Non-coated plates will be used to aid preferential selection of fibroblasts. Incubate at 37 degrees C and 5% CO2.

2\. Monitor/ feed plastic adherent F_NANDO3

  * Perform a 50% feed with  DMEM/F12 + 10% FBS + 1x PS approximately every 72 hours and image cells on feed days. 

3\. Expansion passages

  * When cells appear 80-90% confluent, passage following SOP_Passaging Adherent Cells V_04 using non-coated culture vessels.
  * Cells should be seeded back into plates at approximately 7500 cells/cm2.

4\. Passage and seed cells for immunostaining + Bank master cell bank of
F_NANDO3 cells.

  * When cell numbers are sufficient to be 90% confluent in a 10CF, bank cells as a WCB following Banking-Template_V2 .
