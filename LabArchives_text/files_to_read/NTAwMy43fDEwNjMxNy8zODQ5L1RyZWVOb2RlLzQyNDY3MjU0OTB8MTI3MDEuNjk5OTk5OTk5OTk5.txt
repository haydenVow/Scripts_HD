## Harvest

  1. Transfer flask and aliquots into BSC, ensuring to wipe down containers with 70% EtOH during the transfer.   
  2. Discarded growth media from each flask (for cell factory, carefully poured growth media ideally into a >500 mL waste bottle).
  3. Washed with warmed dPBS, then discarded. (for cell factory equalised and gently swirled flask

  

  

  1. Added TrypLE to each of the flasks. Swirled flask thoroughly to ensure coverage of the surface area.
  2. Placed in the incubator at 37C.
  3. After 5 minutes, swirled flask again to ensure all surfaces are covered.
  4. After 10 minute, removed flasks and observed for 95-100% dissociation of cells. Incubated further if needed until maximum dissociation level is reached.
    1. 4CF: `Time stamp`: 14:34 - 14:54
    2. 2xT175 flasks `Time stamp`: 14:29 - 14:46

  1. Collected TrypLE solution into 50mL or 225 mL centrifuge tubes.
  2. Wash flask with ambient temperature dPBS and transferred into tubes.  (for cell factories, preform the wash twice with 100 mL of dPBS each time)
  3. Centrifuged at 650 x g for 5 minutes.
    1. 2xT175 flasks `Time stamp` 14:53 - 14:58
    2. 4CF `Time stamp` 15:03 - 15:08

  

  1. Gently removed centrifuge tubes from the machine, ensuring not to disturb the suspended pellets.  Removed supernatant.
  2. Resuspend the pellets in 10 mL of growth media total for each clone.
  3. Pipette mix cell suspension to ensure a homegenous cell suspension is obtained. 
  4. Immediately aliquot     100 uL  of cell resuspension into cell count tubes.

  

Inser

  

  1. Triturated the obtained cell suspension 10 times (careful not to make bubbles) and transfer into trypan blue.
  2. Triturated the cells suspended in trypan blue at least 10 times (careful not to make bubbles) and transfer 10 uL onto haemocytometer.
  3. Performed cell count.




## Seed 50 mL spin tubes:

5\. Centrifuge the cells at 650 g for 5 min at RT:     15:58    \-  16 :03  

6\. Removed supernatant to remove residual growth media.  

7\. Resuspended each pellet in PBS:

6 mL for 11E7 clone

1.8 mL for 4C4 clone

8\. Transfer   355 uL  of the 11E7 cell suspension (~1M cells) into 12 of the
pre-warmed growth media conditions and mix. In total there were 3x replicates
for  each of the 4 media conditions.

Transfer 300 uL of the 4C4 cell suspension (~950K cells) into 6 of the pre-
warmed growth media conditions as follows:

1x replicate for RPMI + FBS, 2x replicates for RPMI + KSR, 1x replicate for
CD-CHO + FBS, 2x replicates for CD-CHO + KSR

9\. Transferred flask/plates(s) to incubate at: `  16:46  
`

  * [x]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (aviary cells)

10\. 50 mL bioreactor spin tubes were shaken at 206 RPM to achieve  P/V ~60
W/m3 as per the power/kLa calculator:

Summary:

Seeded 12 million of DOLLY12 MuSC clone 11E7 into into 4 different suspension
media conditions with 3 reps of each medium. Cells were seeded at 200k
cells/mL into 5 mL of media in spin tubes.

Seeded 5.8 million of DOLLY12 fibroblast clone 4C4 into into 4 different
suspension media conditions as follows:

1x replicate for RPMI + FBS, 2x replicates for RPMI + KSR, 1x replicate for
CD-CHO + FBS, 2x replicates for CD-CHO + KSR

clone 4C4 was seeded at ~190k cells/mL into 5 mL of media in spin tubes.

I was expecting higher cell numbers from the 4C4 clone. However, after
checking the previously observed doubling time of ~3 days from a clones
experiment, the low cell numbers for today's harvest make sense. In the
future, this should be taken into account when planning the experiment.
