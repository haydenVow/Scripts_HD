Biopsy #1 used for this







Process  
1\. Place biopsy into a 50mL tubes. Wash by adding 10mL of PBS to tube, mixing
a little and then discarding the PBS. Repeat wash. 14:45 pm  
2\. Remove the biopsy from tubes and place on 100mm plate.  
3\. Finely macerate the tissue using scissors, forceps and scalpel. (this was
done for 15 min with scissors and 2 x scalpels)  
4\. Lightly score the base of the wells of 3x 6 well plates with a scalpel (to
aid cell attachment).  
5\. Divide the macerated tissue from each sample into wells of 3 x 6 well
plates (1 well per plate)  
6\. Add 1mL of DMEM/F12 +20% FBS + 1x P/S to plates 1 and 2.  
7\. Add 1mL of M199 +20% FBS + 1x P/S to well of plate 3.  
Note* 1mL was just enough to cover the muscle mush,  
8\. Parafilm the edges of the plates  
9\. Incubate plate 1 at 37 degrees Celsius with 5% CO2. 15:14 pm  
10\. Incubate plate 2 & 3 at 30 degrees Celsius with 5% CO2. 15:15 pm  

Note: A further 2.5ml of growth media will be added the day after seeding.
