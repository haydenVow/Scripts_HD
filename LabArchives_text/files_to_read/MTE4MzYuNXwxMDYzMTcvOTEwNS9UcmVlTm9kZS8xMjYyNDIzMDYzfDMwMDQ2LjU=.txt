Passaged the 10% serum adapted CHOMP cells into new vessels today.  
  
Cells were passaged as normal out of 3xT175 flasks (ID's 13038-13040)

  1. Cells were washed with sterile filtered dPBS 
  2. Wash was removed and cells were covered with 10mL of sterile filtered tryple-EDTA per flask. 
  3. Cells were incubated for 30 minutes at 5% CO2 for 10 minutes. 
  4. Cells were collected into 50mL tubes and flasks were washed down with equal volumes of dPBS to tryple 
  5. Washes were also collected to the same tubes 
  6. Cells were centrifuged at 650g for 5 minutes to pellet 
  7. Supernatant was discarded and cells were resuspended in 20mL of growth media (made using 20% serum containing media diluted 1:2 with additional DMEM/F12 + 1xP/S media) 
  8. 10uL of cells were taken for a trypan blue stain at a 1:2 dilution followed by a count under a hemocytometer. 

Cells Count = 10,080,000

All of the 10% CHOMP cells were  then used to seed a 2CF in 300mL of growth
media however the cells were seeded in 20% growth media by mistake.

New culture ID (13118)

More growth media needs to be made up for these cells in the future and the
CHOMP 2CF needs to be diluted down to 10% FBS tomorrow.
