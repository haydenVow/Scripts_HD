## Remove the Stimulation Lead Wire

1\. Removed the hook test clips from the electrode connection pins on the
culture dish lid  
  
The test hook can be released from the pin by squeezing the spring loaded test
hook handle. It is best not to touch the metal electrode pins while doing
this. Hold the plastic culture dish lid for stability. If any wires become
dislodged and the operator is unsure about reattachment, contact experiment
owner for assistance   Addy - 0432715545




## Imaging

1\. Prior to imaging, ensure that the numerical aperture (NA) of the Zaber is
fully open (i.e. the toggle on the lens is moved all the way to the left).
Using an exposure setting of 4 ms, select the 'Live' setting and focus the
image on Phase.

2\. Select the 'Plugins' tab and choose 'HCS site generator' on the drop down
menu. Calibrate XY to well A1. When imaging 12wps, ensure 8 x 8 imaging sites
are selected in the HCS site generator, remembering to change the spacing rule
to 'Field of View' with 60 um overlap (refer to the image below). Ensure that
the corner wells are relatively in focus by clicking on the 'Move' option and
then selecting the centres of the 8 x 8 grid on wells A4, C1 and C4. Adjust
the focus as required. Build the MM List.

  

  

3\. Select 'Multi-D Acquisition' and ensure that only the 'Phase' option is
selected and the exposure used in the 'Live' setting is the same as the value
in the table (should be 4 ms). Scanned the QR code on the plate and entered
the following in the comments section:

05-12-21_estim_coatings_exp3_plate_9431 (for plate 9431)

05-12-21_estim_coatings_exp3_plate_94312 (for plate 9432)

4\. Confirm the number of images expected (usually > 700) in Multi-D Acq.

5\. Acquired images for BOTH PLATES using the Zaber   Plate 1: 11am, Plate
2:11:16.  

6\. Imaged each well B using at 10X objective using the Primo microscope.
11:28

Media Change

1\. Retrieved  40 mL  of  E6 Media from a   1 x 50 mL  tube from Fridge #117
next to biostat (brown falcon tubes with green top).  
  
2\. Aliquots placed in water bath for 20 mins 10 : 04 am  

3\. Carefully lifted the lid off the plate and placed it on the BSC surface
such that the electrodes in contact with the cells do not touch anything. This
can be achieved by flipping the plate upside down.

4\. Removed 100% of supernatant (per well/per vessel) and replaced with 1.5 mL
of E6 Diff media, ensuring to do so one well at a time. Changed tips between
plates (can keep the same tip for all wells in a plate).

5\. Returned vessels to incubate and connected the test hooks back up to the
electrode pins on the culture dish lid so that each set of hooks connects to
the corresponding wire colour and so that the black hooks are aligned on the
left side of each well and the red hooks on the right (see wiring setup
reference image below)   : a/pm

6\. Ensured that the oscilloscope displayed a curved waveform for both the
purple and yellow channels (you may need to wake up the oscilloscope by
pressing on the knob directly underneath the word 'Horizontal').
