Reagent preparation:

1\. Centrifuged the secondary antibody stock using the benchtop
microcentrifuge for 10 seconds.

2\. Prepared Secondary Antibody mix (pipette from the top/supernatant of
antibody solution):

  11 µL   Secondary #1   (1: 1000 ) + ~~  7 ~~ ~~µ L   Secondary #2   (1: 1000
) +~~  11  mL Blocking Buffer (PBST (0.1% Triton X + dPBS) + 3% BSA)  

If using AlexaFluor secondary antibodies then the max concentration should be
1:500 (typically used at 1:1000)

Pipette-mixed antibody mix and stored refrigerated away from light until
needed.

3\. Prepared DAPI mix:

  11 mL  PBS +   11 uL  of DAPI (1:1000)

PREPARE PHALLOIDIN MIX

Vortexed DAPI mix and stored refrigerated away from light until needed.

  

Number of wells for the 12wps = 24

2 mL PBS per well per wash

Number of washes before adding SAb = 3

Number of washes after adding DAPI + Phalloidin = 3

Top up with PBS = 1

Total volume of PBS required: 24 x 7 x 2 mL = 336 mL

  

Secondary staining with Ab (2 x 1:1000 dilution)  

400 uL of SAb per well for 12wp

  

11 mL / 1000 = 11 uL of secondary Ab required

11 mL of BB required to dilute SAb (MF20)

  

4.8 mL + 3 mL excess (OT2) = 8 mL PBS per plate to dilute DAPI + Phalloidin

Process:

1\. Removed plate from fridge (incubated in primary antibodies overnight).

2\. Washed 3 times for 5 min with PBS at RT.

11:05 - 11:14 - 11:23  a/pm (8822)

11:10 - 11:18 - 11:27  a/pm (8823)

3\. Incubated the cells with secondary antibody mixture in the dark at RT for
1 hour.

11:34 - : a/pm (8822)

11:38 - : a/pm (8823)

NOTE: from this step onwards protect from the light by wrapping plates in foil
and perform experiment in the dark.




Counter staining

1\.  Removed 2nd antibody solution.

13:18 a/pm (8822)

13:23 a/pm (8823)

2\.  Washed with DAPI (1:1000) in PBS for 5 min at RT in the dark.

13:20 - :  a/pm (8822)

13:25 - :  a/pm (8823)

3\.  Washed in PBS 3 x 5 min at RT in the dark. (No Triton)

13:30 - 13:38 - 13:49  a/pm (8822)

13:34 - 13:42 - 13:56  a/pm (8823)

4\.  Replaced dPBS.

14:01 a/pm (8822)

14:06 a/pm (8823)

5\. Confirmed staining on microscope by imaging.

Observations/Summary:

Had a few issues with the OT2 SAb staining protocol - wells A1-C1, A2 and B2
in plate 9432 were prematurely stained with DAPI and Phalloidin after only
completing one PAb wash with PBS. This run was terminated, the Phalloidin +
DAPI mix in PBS was remade and the OT2 protocol was restarted. The new start
time was 14:15. When the protocol finished at 5:55 pm, it was noticed that two
of the PBS washes were not performed for the second plate (9342). The
remaining washes were done manually and the plates were parafilmed and placed
in the fridge at 6:25 pm.

2 x estim plates secondary stained with MF20, Phalloidin and DAPI - ready to
be imaged.
