Aim/Purpose: To adapt fibroblasts isolated straight from the biopsy to suspension culture
Hypothesis: Fibroblasts recently isolated from the biopsy will adapt to suspension culture more easily
Technical Gap: We have only ever tried to adapt fibroblasts to suspension culture after they have been extensively cultured in adherent culture.
Method/Procedure


  1. [Experiment Plan]
  2. [Peer Review]
  3. [Make amendments and Sign off] 
  4. [Thursday July 8th] Thaw 1 x vial of chicken fibroblasts into 1 x T175 into D/F + 10% FBS + 1x PS
  5. [Thursday July 8th] Thaw 1 x vial of chicken fibroblasts directly into 25mL of DMEM + 10% FBS + 1x PS in 1 x E125 flask and set to shake, ideally at 130rpm. This flask should be fed & counted every 48hrs as per the rest of the suspension cultures.
  6. [Friday July 9th] Perform a 50% feed of adherent chicken fibroblasts
  7. Expand fibroblasts. Feed every 3 days. When there are alpaca biopsy fibroblasts available, transition the cells into suspension culture.
  8. [Day 0 - Wednesday July 14th] Transition the fibroblasts into suspension culture. Use a 50mL mini-bioreactor. Count the number of chicken and alpaca fibroblasts, divide those numbers in two, and seed two conditions for each species. Seed at ~500k cells/mL (may need to adjust based on the number of cells)  
  
Include the following conditions:

    1. Chicken fibroblasts: Control. D/F + 10% FBS + 1x PS
    2. Chicken fibroblasts: Best Guess. D/F + 10% FBS + 1x PS + 1:100 anti-clumping agent + 10uM ROCKi + integrin binding peptides
    3. Alpaca fibroblasts: Control. D/F + 10% FBS + 1x PS
    4. Alpaca fibroblasts: Best Guess. D/F + 10% FBS + 1x PS + 1:100 anti-clumping agent + 10uM ROCKi + integrin binding peptides
  9. [Day 2] Perform a 50% feed. Count cells & assess viability.
  10. [Day 4] Repeat 50% feed and cell count process every 48hrs for ~30 days or until the cells appear adapted, whichever comes first.
  11. Track viability and cell numbers overtime to record the amount of "recovery" during the adaptation process.
  12. If fibroblast viability is high but proliferation rates are non-existent or low, 100ng/mL of IGF-LR3 and 100ng/mL of FGF can be added to kick-start fibroblast proliferation.

After the lab work is complete:

  1. [Report writing (Draft)]
  2. [Review & fill out Report (Full)]
  3. [Ensure all lab books are complete & assign for review]
  4. [Review Lab Books, results, report]
  5. [Make necessary amendments and confirm with reviewer that experiment is complete
  6. [Release note on Project Updates]
