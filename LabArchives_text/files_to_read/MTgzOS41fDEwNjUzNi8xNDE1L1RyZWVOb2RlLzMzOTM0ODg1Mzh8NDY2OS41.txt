Harvest 1x10CS


Procedure

### Cell Harvest

  1. Turn on water bath and set temperature to 32C.
  2. Take the flasks for harvest and observe under the microscope at 4x objective for even cell distribution . Refer to VSOP-006. Take 2-3 images per flask.
  3. Aliquot required volume of  dPBS (ambient temp) and TrypLE in separate sterile pots.  Refer to Table below for required volume.
  4. Place aliquots in pre-warmed water bath and leave for at least 20 minutes or until warmed. Note: Ensure TrypLE is thoroughly warmed.
  5. Transfer aliquots and flasks required for harvest into the BSC.
  6. Collect growth media and loose aggregates from each flask.
  7. Wash with warmed dPBS, then collect this also.
  8. Add TrypLE to each of the flasks. Mix thoroughly to ensure coverage of the surface area.
  9. Place in the incubator at 37C. After 5 minutes, remove flasks and observe for 95-100% dissociation of cells. Incubate further until maximum dissociation level is reached.  
     NOTE: The flasks must be removed from the incubator within 18 minutes of initial incubation of TrypLE containing flasks
  10. Aspirate the TrypLE solution and collect into 250mL centrifuge tubes.
  11. Add ambient temperature dPBS to each flask as a final wash. To effectively remove remaining cells adhered to the flasks, mix thoroughly and then pour the dPBS into 250mL centrifuge tubes.
  12. Centrifuge at 700 x g for 5 minutes.````
  13. Meanwhile remove aggregates from collected growth media and dPBS via carefully aspiration with a serological pipette and place them into a 250mL centrifuge tube.
  14. Centrifuge this also at 700 x g for 5 minutes.
  15. Gently remove centrifuge tubes from the machine, ensuring not to disturb the cell pellets. Aspirate as much supernatant as possible from the tubes by pouring out in one gentle and swift motion. Note: Tilting the tube upright may cause the pellet to dislodge and mixed back into suspension.

### Re-pellet and Weigh Final Yield

  1. Label and Record the weight of 1 sterile centrifuge tube and set aside. Record details in Widget.  
  2. Add growth media to each centrifuge tube and resuspend cells. Refer to the table below for the required amount of growth media to be added.
  3. Combine all resuspended cells into the weighed centrifuge tube. 
  4. Wash all empty centrifuge tubes with growth media and add this to the centrifuge tube containing the resuspended cells. 
  5. Centrifuge at 700 x g x 5 minutes. 
  6. Aspirate the supernatant from the tube. Remove as much remaining supernatant with a 1mL pipette.
  7. Record the final weight of the cell pellet. Enter details in Widget. 
  8. Immediately provide to the food team for testing.
