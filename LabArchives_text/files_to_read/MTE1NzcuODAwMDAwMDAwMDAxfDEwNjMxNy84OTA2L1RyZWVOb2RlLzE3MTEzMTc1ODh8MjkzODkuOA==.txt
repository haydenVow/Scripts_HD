Process:

  1. Made up 1L of DMEM/F12 + BSA + ITS + P/S media.
  2. Obtained 60M cells from cell supply team by aspirating 18ml of Culture XXXX and aliquotting into a 15ml falcon tube.
  3. Centrifuged cell suspension for 5 minutes at 800g.
  4. Removed supernatant and resuspended pellet in 90mL of basal media (above). Pellet took a while to break apart into suspension.
  5. Seeded 6 x 48 well plates by aliquotting 300uL of cell suspension into each well.
  6. Placed well plates into incubator 51 (top right Binder in Main Lab). 5% CO2, 37C.
  7. Dissolved 42g of Ficoll PM 70 into 140ml of basal media to make up a 300mg/ml stock of Ficoll 70 media. 
  8. Dissolved 15.4 mg of Carrageenan (lab grade) into 110mL of basal media to make up a 140 ug/ml stock of Carrageenan MMC media.
  9. Stirred both crowder solutions with magnetic stirrer at 37C to speed up dissolution.




Observations/Summary:

Prep for DSD done by making MMC media, 6 x 48 well plates seeded.

Ficoll PM 70 was dissolved by constant magnetic stirring at room temperature
and took approximately 3 hours to fully dissolve.

CG did not pellet during mixing and suspended particles that have been noticed
before were not present this time.
