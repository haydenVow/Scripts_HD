Procedure

Before starting Media Top Up perform a microscope check to ensure there is no
contamination in the Bioreactor OR media containing vessel.

  1. Connect the media containing vessel to the STR200 or STR2000 in a sterile manner
  2. Use a peristaltic pump to pump media into the Bioreactor at a moderate speed
  3. Once the desired volume is reached immediately clamp the lines to prevent back flow
  4. Dis-connect the Media containing vessel from the bioreactor

No contamination or microbes present in the media. In addition the exhaust gas
had no prominent smell coming from it, other than warm milk, which is the
usual smell for just warm media.
