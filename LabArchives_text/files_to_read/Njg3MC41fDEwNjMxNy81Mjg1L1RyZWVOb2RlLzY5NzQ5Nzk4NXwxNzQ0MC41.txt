As the wallaby sample arrived at the Vowse frozen, it was decided that a
single biopsy should be processed. While we suspected that the cells within
the tissue would have been badly damaged by the freezing process, the single
biopsy was performed to see if live cells could be extracted from tissue that
had been frozen in this mannerr.  In order to maximise the likelihood of
obtaining a live cell population from our crude homogenate, the entire isolate
from the processed biopsy was placed into culture, with none being frozen for
later use. After 4 days in culture, we did not see any attachment, flattening
and elongation of cells onto the culture vessel.  
  
It is highly probable that the freeze/thawing of the meat prior to taking the
biopsy resulted in very low, or no cell viability within the tissue. The
homogenate was visualised under the microscope 24 hours after processing and
and there appeared to be a lot of debris present with very few cells.  
  
Clearer communication with the animal farm/processing facility as well as the
courier company about the proper storage and transport of the meat may be
required in future. This will hopefully prevent meat from arriving at the
Vowse frozen.

Another biopsy and isolation will need to be arranged in order to obtain a
healthy cell population of wallaby cells for our library.
