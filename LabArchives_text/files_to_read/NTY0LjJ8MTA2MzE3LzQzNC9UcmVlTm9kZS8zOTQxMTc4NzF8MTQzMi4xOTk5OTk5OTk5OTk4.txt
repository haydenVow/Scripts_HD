Method/Procedure

Table of volumes:

Flask TypedPBS at 37˚C (washing)  
  
  
  
  
T17515mL  
  
  
  
  
  
  




1\.  Turn on water bath and set temperature to 37˚C.

2\. Take the flasks for harvest and observe under the microscope

3\.  Aliquot required volume of dPBS (37C) 15mL

4\.  Place aliquots in pre-warmed water bath and leave for ~20 minutes or
until warmed.

NOTE - use the warmed dPBS is to wash the flask before the Tryple, this way we
don't cool down the flask before adding the warm tryple, so must ensure this
is warmed properly, also the tryple must be warmed properly before adding to
the flasks because the size of the 4CFs means that the 10 mins in the
incubator won't be enough to heat it all up and get the enzyme working




5\.  Transfer aliquots and flasks required for harvest into the BSC, ensuring
to wipe down containers with 70% EtOH during the transfer.  

6\. Weigh a 50mL conical tube and record the weight 13.1g

7\. Filter out the fibroblast aggregates and place in the 50mL conical. Record
the weight.




8.  Was twice with  5 mL  of warmed dPBS

9\.  Once wash has been completed, carefully pour the dPBS into a 500ml waste
container.

10\. Wash a final time with PBS and bring aggregates outside of the lab when
Suz is ready.
