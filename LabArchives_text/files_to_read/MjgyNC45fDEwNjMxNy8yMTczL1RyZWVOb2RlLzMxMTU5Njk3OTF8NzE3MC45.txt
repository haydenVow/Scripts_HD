Achieve a biomass doubling time of <24h and a final biomass of 5g/L in a 2L bioreactor, in ACF.


Scoring Guide:

0.25 = Fibroblasts are growing in a bioreactor.

0.50 = Maximum achievable biomass density in batch mode is determined,
limiting nutrients/metabolites are identified

0.75 = Fibroblasts biomass doubling time is <24h.

1.0 = 5g/L final biomass is harvested from the bioreactor in an ACF media.

  

Considerations:

  1. Optimise an ACF media to support 5g/L final biomass (~5 million cells per mL)
  2. Optimise media to achieve a suspension doubling time of <24h doubling time
  3. High-level metric: volumetric biomass production (g/L/day)
