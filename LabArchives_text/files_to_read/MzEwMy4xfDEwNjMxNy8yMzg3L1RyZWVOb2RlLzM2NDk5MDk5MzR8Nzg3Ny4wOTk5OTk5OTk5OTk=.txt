Growth Media:

  * [x ]  DMEM/F12 + 10% FBS + 1X P/S 




### Process:

1\. Took image of vessel with microscope on phase setting.  

3\. Aliquotted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then
placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath for a minimum of 20 minutes
prior to use:

  1. TrypLE:    15     mL in       1  tube.
  2.  dPBS (for washing and neutralising):    10     mL in 1  tube
  3. dPBS (for neutralising):    10    mL in      1  tube
  4. Growth media (for pellet resuspension):   5  mL in    1  tube
  5. Growth media (for seeding):   90mL  in   1 urine pot  

Time that all aliquots were placed in the water bath the warm before use
9:40  

Note: if aliquots were placed in water bath at different time, record the time
stamp for each individual solution.




4\. Removed vessel(s) from the incubator   09:50

5\. Washed the vessel(s) with dPBS (warmed).

6\. Added     10    mL tryple to each vessel/well and incubated at 37˚C.
Checked tryple at 10 min, ~80% cells detached so replaced in incubator for 5
more min.  

  1. Start/Finish for TrypLE was   09:55 - 10:07    

7\. Neutralised with    10 mL   dPBS and combined cell suspension into   1 x
50 mL   tube.

8\. Centrifuged at 650 x g for 5 min.

  1. Start/Finish time for centrifugation was   10:15 - 10:20    




9\. Aspirated the supernatant(s).

10\. Resuspended pellet(s) in    5     mL       growth   media  

11\. Aliquoted     2 x 40ul     of resuspended cells into a microcentrifuge
tube for cell count.

12\. Performed a cell count using the haemocytometer and recorded the cell
count data in the Google Doc spreadsheet called 'Cell Count Spreadsheet' (see
link below):

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1DPzKubYxfHmWogVPihC-
SSIBtIylyrBQE5kRX5Z8NtI/edit#gid=0

  1.  Total cell number was:     2,950,000     

  2. Volume of cell suspension required for subculture was:    5 mL (total)    

  3. Cell density per vessel:   5,700 cm2 (3xT175)    




14\. Transferred cell suspension into pre-warmed 90mL media  

16\. Transferred vessel(s) to incubate at: 11:00  

  * [ x]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (avian cells)
