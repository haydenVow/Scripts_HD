Experimental plan

  1.  Establish a dilution series from concentrated cell suspension
    1. starting conc. = 1.7 M cells in 400 uL = 4.25M/mL in well A1 of a 1 mL deep well plate
    2. transfer 200 uL suspension into well B1 and add 200 uL PBS
    3. repeat step 2 until well A10 for a total of 10 datapoints 
    4. fill well in A11 with PBS as control
    5. A12 to remain empty
    6. multichannel transfer 100 uL from each well into row 1 and 2 of a non-TC 96well plate
    7. spin down to remove bubbles
  2.  Read plate on Nanostar with OD measurement protocol "xxxxx" (download and append here)
  3.  Analyze data and establish calibration curve
