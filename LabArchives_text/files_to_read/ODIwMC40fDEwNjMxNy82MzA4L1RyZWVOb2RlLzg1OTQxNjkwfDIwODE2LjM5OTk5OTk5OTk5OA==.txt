Procedure


Prepare media

Medium needed for CHOMP cultures

  * 4 x 384 well plates (50 uL per well) = 76 mL 
  * Total to prep = 100 mL 

Medium was prepared using the following volumes:

Final growth medium vol (mL)100  
  
  
  
  
Desired conc (mg/mL)Stock conc (mg/mL)Total mg in final volVol to add (mL)

Total medium vol (mL)100.00  
  
Medium needed for CHO-S culture

  * 1 x 384 well plates (50 uL per well) = 19.2 mL
  * Total = 25 mL

Medium was prepared using following volumes:

Prepare plates

  1. Add 50 uL/well of fresh Growth Medium (HyCell+20%KSR+1xP/S+10ng/mL FGF) to plates
  2. Parafilm plates before closing the lid (sterile-side down, facing wells, as demonstrated in image below) & then parafilm lids and plates together (same fashion as is done for fix and stained plates in fridge) for transport to Garvan

  




Prepare FACS buffer

  1. Prepare 20mL of FACS buffer (PRF DMEM/F12 + 2% FBS).
    1. 400 uL FBS + 19.6 mL PRF DMEM/F12
  2. Sterile filter through a 0.2 µm filter.
  3. Store at 4ºC until needed




Prepare cells for FACS by following relevant harvesting protocol (lab book:

  2. Once cell pellet was generated after neutralising:
    1. Re-suspended pellet in _3_ mL Growth Medium (can go up to 4 - 5mL if necessary, just keep in mind Hoechst is 100 X so if cell suspension is 5 mL, add 50 uL of Hoechst in the next step, etc.)
    2. Placed the FACS tube cell suspension on ice. 

  




Prepare 1 styrofoam boxes to transfer to the Garvan

1 Box with:

  * Pre-filled (medium) multi-well plates, parafilmed
  * An ice pack
  * Hoechst (ddH20) - vial is located in large new fridge in library lab, top shelf of door in 70 mL urine conatiner 
  * Extra FACS Buffer
  * Tube containing cells
