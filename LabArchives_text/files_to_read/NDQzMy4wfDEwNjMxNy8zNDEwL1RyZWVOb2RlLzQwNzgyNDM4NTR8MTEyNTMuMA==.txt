Perform feed using below volumes:

  






Growth Media:

  * [x]  DMEM/F12 + 20% FBS + 1X P/S
  * [x]  M199 + 20% FBS + 1X P/S




Reagent preparation

1\. Aliquot   2.5 mL DMEM/F12 +20% FBS +1x p/S . Placed in incubator to warm
to 37 degrees14:04 pm  
2\. Aliquot  2.5 mL DMEM/F12 +20% FBS +1x p/S . Placed in water bath to warm
to 30 degrees 14:04 pm  
3\. Aliquot  2.5 mL M199 +20% FBS +1x p/S . Placed in water bath to warm to 30
degrees  14:04 pm  




Process

1\. Image cells at 10x magnification

2\.  Add 2.5ml  respective media to plates following the table below. Add
media gently by pipetting down the side of the well to avoid disturbing
tissue.

5\. Returned vessel to incubate at: 15:36 pm  

  * [x]  37ºC, 5% CO2  OR [x]  30ºC, 5% CO2  (see table bellow)
