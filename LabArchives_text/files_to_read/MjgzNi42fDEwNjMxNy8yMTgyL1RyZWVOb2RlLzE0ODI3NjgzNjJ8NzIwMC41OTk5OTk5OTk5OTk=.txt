  * Platinum is bioinert and won't elicit electrolysis
    1. Bend into L shape to go through lid
  * Held in place with superconductive glue or silicone
    1. https://www.future-science.com/doi/full/10.2144/000114382
  * Copper wires for soldering with platinum electrodes:

# Plate details

  * 24-well plate depth is 16.10 mm, so the electrodes should be this long, as the lid is raised several mm from the surface of the well.
  * Well diameter is 14 mm, but each electrode should be spaced far apart in each well, perhaps 3.5 mm from each end.
  * The L-shape should be 16.1 mm vertical, 6 mm horizontal
  * Capacitive coupling or direct coupling?

# External electronics

  * This will be the non-sterile parts, including electrical boards to deliver correct power supply
  * Arduino Uno microcontroller
  * Banana connectors, electrical pins, bread board

# Sterilization

  * Ethanol bath followed by UV sterilization > 1 hour
    1. Could flip lid over after 1 hour and do 1 hour each side
  * Can verify this technique using available bacterial detection kits
