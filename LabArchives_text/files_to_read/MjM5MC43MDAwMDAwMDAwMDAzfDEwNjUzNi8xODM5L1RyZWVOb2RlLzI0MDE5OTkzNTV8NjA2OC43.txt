Draw (Harvest): AK/SM/SR/LP

Cell suspension removed from bag in ~1hr

Centrifuging started at: 12:45

Harvesting finished at: 17:00

95L of media was pumped out of the STR200 into a palletank bag. This will then
be connected to the centrifuge to harvest the cells.  
  
The Centrifuge was cleaned out with sanitiser and hot water. The bowl was
filled with sanitiser and left for 10 mins of contact time. Sanitiser was
drained and the bowl filled with hot water and scrubbed with a scourer. The
water was drained and the bowl filled with hot water again then drained. The
palletank bag with cells was then connected onto peri pump/centrifuge setup

Centrifuge was rotated at the maximum speed achievable and cell suspension was
pumped in at 70rpm to give a flow rate of 500mL/min.  
  
The two satellite flask that were seeded from the bag on 08/07 were harvested
with the 95L




Preparing sample for regulation:

1\. Transfer the dip tube line into the BSC.

2\. Connect the tubing to a peristaltic pump

3\. Pump at least 350 mL of cell suspension from the 200L bag into a sterile
500 mL container

4\. Cap the dip tube and the 500 mL bottle and transfer the bottle into main
lab.

5\. Prepare the growth factor, Species ID, mycoplasma and genetic drift
samples in the following manner:

  1. Growth factors: Transfer 100 mL of the cell suspension into 2x 50 mL falcon tubes and centrifuge at 1000 rcf for 5 mins to pellet the cells. Decant the supernatant and leave the pellet intact. Store at -80'C
  2. Species ID: Transfer 100 mL of the cell suspension into 2x 50 mL falcon tubes and centrifuge at 1000 rcf for 5 mins to pellet the cells. Decant the supernatant and leave the pellet intact. Store at -80'C
  3. Mycoplasma: Transfer 3 mL of the cell suspension into 2x 1.5mL eppendorf tubes and centrifuge at 450 rcf for 5 mins to pellet the cells. Decant the supernantant into another 1.5 mL tubes careful not to aspirate the cell pellet. Store the tubes at -80'C
  4. Genetic drift: Transfer 100 mL of the cell suspension into 2x 50 mL falcon tubes and centrifuge at 1000 rcf for 5 mins to pellet the cells. Decant the supernatant and leave the pellet intact. Store at -80'C

  

6\. Fill in the following spreadsheet with information on storage and sample
ID




Fill: AK/SM/SR/LP

Filling started at: 12:35

Filling finished at: 16:30

Media being pumped in: MIX-13310

Media Type: 1:1 RPMI/CHO-in-1

Media was pumped into the STR200 at a rate of 20 RPM as this kept the input
temp below 41'C and the recorded temp above 36'C. Given the error when making
the media, the weight was made to 177.5 kg then the filtered ID water bag was
welded onto the 200L STR bag with an additional 9.5L of water pumped in. The
remaining ID water was then added to the palletank bag after welding.  
  
GF, antifoam and L-glutamine were added after the media finished pumping into
the bag


Growth Factors


IGF: 95 mL (A12935, A12939, A13035)

EGF: 19 mL (A12880, A12879)

L-glutamine: 1414 mL (A12942, M13004)

Antifoam C: 9.5 mL (M6141)
