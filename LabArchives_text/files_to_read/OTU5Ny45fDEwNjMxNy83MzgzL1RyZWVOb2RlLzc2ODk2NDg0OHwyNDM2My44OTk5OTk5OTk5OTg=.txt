From 8th-12th of March, we saw a rapid uptick in cell numbers across several
cultures. This increase co-coincided with the addition of EGF and IGF1 to all
cultures. On the 14/3 however, we saw that these cultures had declined. This
may be due to the fact that on 8/3, growth factors were added directly to
cultures, while on 11/3, the media change was performed using media that had
been prepared with growth factors, and then sterile filtered through a vaccum
filter unit. I now know that when in low protein media, these growth factors
are likely to bind to the filters, meaning they are lost from the media. Low
protein binding filters are therefore recommended for filter sterilization
(which the vaccume filter units are not). Today I will top up the growth
factors by directly adding  to each culture, to see if this improves
proliferation.
