### Process:

1\. Aliquotted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then
placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath for a minimum of 20 minutes
prior to use:

  1. TrypLE:      200   mL   

  2.  dPBS (for neutralising):    200 mL
  3.  dPBS (for washing):     200   mL
  4. Growth media (for pellet resuspension):      40   mL
  5. Growth media (for seeding into a 10CF):  1500 mL 

Time that all aliquots were placed in the water bath the warm before use
14:10

Note: if aliquots were placed in water bath at different time, record the time
stamp for each individual solution.




4\. Removed vessel(s) from the incubator   14:45

5\. Washed the vessel(s) with  200   dPBS (warmed).

6\. Added     200  mL tryple to each vessel/well and incubated at 37˚C.

  1. Start/Finish for TrypLE was   14:54- 14:59  

7\. Neutralised with     200   dPBS and combined cell suspension into a  8 x
50ml centrifuge tube.

8\. Centrifuged at 650 x g for 5 min.

  1. Start/Finish time for centrifugation was 15:22 - 15:27    




9\. Aspirated the supernatant(s).

10\. Resuspended pellet(s) in   45  mL     Growth     media   15:45  

11\. Aliquoted   10ul   of resuspended cells into a microcentrifuge tube for
cell count.

12\. Performed a cell count using the haemocytometer and recorded the cell
count data in the Google Doc spreadsheet: Cell Count Spreadsheet or cell count
widget below. Cell count added to the doublings calculator to track the
doublings time

  1. Total  cell number was:    66,060,000  

  2. Volume of cell suspension required for subculture was:    45 mL      

  3. Cell density per vessel:   10,452 cells/cm (all cells were reseeded)  




13\. Transferred      45mL   of cell suspension to the pre-warmed  1500 mL
Growth media: 15:58

14\. Transferred cell suspension into the      1x 10CF    vessel.

16\. Transferred vessel(s) to incubate at: 16:04

  * [ X]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (avian cells)




Observations/Summary:

F_KUZCO20 expanded from 1X4CF flask to 1x10CF. Cells appeared as usual under
the microscope, prior to passaging.
