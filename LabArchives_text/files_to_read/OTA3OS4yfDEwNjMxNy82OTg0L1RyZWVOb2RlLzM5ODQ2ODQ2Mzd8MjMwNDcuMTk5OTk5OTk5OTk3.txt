Digestion with Collagenase II in plate with scalpels (Alex)  

  1. Collect the liver samples (~3-5g each) and transfer into tube containing 20 mL of dPBS (incl 5x P/S).
  2. Transfer tubes into lab.
  3. Transfer each liver sample to 1 x 100mm plate, and maintain moisture by adding digestion buffer so it doesn't dry out.
  4. Mince liver sample with scalpels until a slurry is developed (5-8 mins).   : - : pm
  5. Transfer slurry to a collection 150mm dish or 120ml urine pot containing 10mL or 40mL Digestion buffer  : pm

  10. Resuspend each pellet in 30mL of Williams Medium E (incl hepatocyte supplement pack)
  11. divide as follows:
    1. 10mL into 1 x collagen Type I coated 100mm plate
    2. 10mL into 1 x gelatin coated 100mm plate
    3. 10mL into 1 x uncoated 100mm plate
  12. Parafilm edges of each plate/vessel and transfer into a 37ºC incubator with 5% CO2   : pm
