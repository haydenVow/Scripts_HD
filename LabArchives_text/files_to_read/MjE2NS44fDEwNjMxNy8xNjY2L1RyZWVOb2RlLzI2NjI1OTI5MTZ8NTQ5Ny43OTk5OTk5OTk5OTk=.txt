1\. Gelatin coated  6  x  T25  flasks/plates with sterile filtered 0.1%
gelatin solution and then incubated all coated flasks at 37ºC

  * Time when all flasks placed into the incubator   11 : 29         

2\. Aliquotted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then
placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath for a minimum of 20 minutes
prior to use:

  * Growth media (for seeding):    30 mL in  1  tubes 
  * Growth media (for resuspension and counts):   30 mL in  1  tubes 
  * Time that aliquots were placed in the water bath to warm before use:   11:41

## Thaw and seed vial:

3\. Collected the cryovial from Liquid Nitrogen storage & place in foam
floater in water bath for 5 min  : - : a/pm

Location where cryovial was collected from:

Vial details:    1 cryovial containing   540 K  cells

Brew

Tower/Bucket #1

Box/Cane #1

Vial location:

Vial ID(s): 2209-Culture-6066-Vial-10of74

`4. Ethanol sprayed & transferred the vial(s) to the BSC.`

`5.  Added  500 µL of Growth Media (to generate a total volume of 1mL in the
cryovial) to the cryovial, resuspended the cell suspension gently to reduce
osmotic shock. ``Aliquoted 10uL of cell suspension for a cell count.`

`6. Collected the remaining ~1mL of cell suspension & transfer into the pre-
warmed tube of 30 mL Growth Media. ```

`Performed a cell count.`

`Total cell count was: 756 000k cells in 30mL  
`

`125k cells = 4.96 mL from 30mL`

`62.5k cells = 2.48mL from 30mL`

7\. Prepared the following cell suspensions:

    125k cells in 30 mL of growth media

    62.5k cells in 5 mL of growth media

`8. Transfered   5 mL to each pre-coated  T25  flask/well, allow to rest in
the BSC at RT for 30 min  16:28 - 16:58 a/pm `

`9. Transfered flask/plate(s) to incubate at: `

  * [X]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (aviary cells)

  

Making labels

Note - You will need to increase the passage number by one. (i.e. if your
thawed vial ID has a passage number of 3, when you make a culture ID for you
vessel you will need change the passage number to 4 on Airtable.)

  




SOPs used:

  * Thaw/Revival Template_V3

  

Summary:

Revived DOLLY12 WCB cells into serum containing media in 6 x T25 flasks. 5 of
these were seeded with 1000 cells/cm^2. 1x T25 was seeded with 2500
cells/cm^2.




### Results:

  * Results were;
    * [X]  As Usual (this is a repetitive task)
    * [ ]  Unexpected because...
    * [ ]  Need to be further analysed
    * [ ]  Other (.......)
