21APR21: Prepare Zein


12-April-2021 Preparation of zein (3SP)

Volumes of zein needed for different plate formats:

6-well plate - 1 scaffold = 1ml

24-well plate - 1 scaffold = 300 ul (pipetted onto 2 ml of water)

96-well plate - 1 scaffold = 50ul

  

Chris: 5g zein, 20ml 100% ethanol, 5ml water. Mixing with magnetic stir bar
11:25 - 11:55 am

Aliquotted 200uL/well sterile MilliQ into 2 x full 96-well plates and 2mL/well
sterile MilliQ into 1 x full 24-well plate.

  

  

  1. Determine the following key volumes and weights to make the desired number of scaffold pieces:
    1. Number of scaffold pieces desired: 32x1 = 32 scaffolds 
    2. Volume of zein solution used per scaffold piece: 50 uL per piece, ~ 5 mL sol'n per 96WP 
    3. Total volume of zein solution (number of scaffold pieces x volume/piece) + loss/error: 32*50 + error = 25 mL total sol'n (incl excess samples)
    4. Total grams of zein required (total volume of zein solution / 5): (x = answer from above)/5 = 5 g zein powder (incl excess samples)
    5. Total volume of 80% ethanol to make (total volume of zein solution + loss/error to the filter):  = 25 mL 80% ethanol
  2. Acquire aliquot volumes of the Ultrapure water (sterile filter milliQ water using a 0.2 um filter into a sterile tube in the BSC) and of 100% ethanol 65 + 4 + error = 80 mL of Ultrapure water needed
  3. Weigh out 3.6 g of zein powder into a sterile sample pot and record the actual weight below:
    1. Actual zein weight: 5.000 g
  4. Transfer the zein powder, 100% ethanol and Ultrapure water into the BSC in the Production lab
  5. Make 20 mL of 80% ethanol in the BSC and filter it using a 0.2 um filter
    1. Volume made: 20 mL
  6. Add 25 mL of 80% ethanol into a sterile sample pot/container and add a sterile magnetic stirrer bar (previously spray with ethanol then autoclave in a autoclave bag) inside the BSC
  7. Commence mixing of the 80% ethanol on the stirrer (sprayed down and brought into the BSC) and slowly add the pre-weighed 5 g zein powder until it is all added
  8. Mix at room temperature until the powder has completely solubilised (20-60 minutes):
    1. Start time: 11:25 am
    2. Finish time: 11:55 am
  9. Add 200 uL of 0.2 um filtered ultrapure water to each well of a 96-well plates (use multichannel pipette) 
    1. Number of 96-well plates required: 2 plates 
    2. Number of 24-well plates required: 1 plates 
    3. Total vol. filtered ultrapure water required = 88 mL + error = 90 mL 
  10. After solubilisation, carefully add 200 uL of the zein solution to the top surface of the ultrapure water in each well in the 24-well plate (drop by drop) so that a skin forms on the surface of the water (use multichannel) 
  11. Allow the zein to form in each plate inside the BSC with the lids completely removed for 60-90 minutes
    1. Start time (last plate): 12:00 (checked at : : and : pm)
    2. Finish time: (started removing first pieces) : pm
  12. After solubilisation, carefully add 50 uL of the zein solution to the top surface of the ultrapure water in each well in the 96-well plate (drop by drop) so that a skin forms on the surface of the water (use multichannel) 
  13. Allow the zein to form in each plate inside the BSC with the lids completely removed for 60-90 minutes
  14. Using a sterile spatula and forceps, loosen the edges of each zein piece from the walls of the wells and transfer the zein pieces into a sterile sample pot/container/tissue culture dish with 20 mL of DMEM. Discard any damaged or cracked pieces
  15. Seal the container and store the scaffold pieces at 4C overnight or until needed, for a maximum of 7 days prior to use.

## Finish time: 13:48
