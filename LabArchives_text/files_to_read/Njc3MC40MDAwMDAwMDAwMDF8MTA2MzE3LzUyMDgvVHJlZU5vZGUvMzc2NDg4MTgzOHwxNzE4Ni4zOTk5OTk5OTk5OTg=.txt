 3\. Added the following reagents to the water bath and media to incubator and
warm at 37 degrees Celsius 11:05, 14:00 (90mL)

  

  * Growth media (for seeding) shaker tubes: 1x16mL D/F media, 1x16mL CD CHO 

  * Growth media (for seeding) E125 flasks:  1x 90 mL D/F media , 1x90mL CD CHO  
  

  * 3\. Added the following reagents to the water bath and media to incubator and warm at 30 degrees Celsius 11:05, 14:00 (90mL)
  * Growth media (for seeding) shaker tubes: 1x16mL D/F media, 1x16mL CD CHO 
  * Growth media (for seeding) E125 flasks:  1x 90 mL D/F media , 1x90mL CD CHO




Process:  
E-125 flasks

  1. Collected E125s from shaker, wiped with ethanol-sprayed Rediwipe, and brought into BSC
  2. Using a 25 mL serelogical pipette, gently pipette-mixed culture for 1 minute to break up cell clumps
  3. Transfer suspension into 50 mL tubes. Kept E125 vessels in BSC, as culture will be returned to this vessel after feed. 
  4. Centrifuged 50 mL tubes at 300 x g for 5 min 14:06 -14:11
  5. Aspirated  100% (30 mL) of supernatant, taking extra care to not disrupt or aspirate pellet. Leave approximately 1 mL of supernatant in the 50 mL tube to avoid disturbing the pellet. 
  6. Resuspend pellet in remaining supernatant using a P1000 pipette
  7. Added  30 mL of fresh, warmed growth media to each 50 mL tube
  8. Took 100 uL samples from each culture and stored in separate microtubes until ready to stain alongside 50 mL shake tubes.
  9. Gently pipette-mixed cultures using serological, before moving cell suspension back to E125s
  10. Returned E125s to incubator 15:39

Process:

50 mL shake tubes

  1. Paused shaker by pressing the "play" button on the controller on the side wall of the incubator
  2. Collected shake tubes from shaker 
  3. Centrifuged at 300 x g for 5 min
    1. Timestamp  11:18-11:23
  4. While tubes were centrifuging, loaded protocol linked below (added protocol as attachment) on computer next to OT2 and set up deck as described at calibration step
  5. Ethanol-sprayed  shake tubes and loaded on OT2
  6. Collected media aliquots from water bath, ethanol-sprayed, and loaded on OT2 deck. Ensured that media aliquot deck positions matched up with intended feed tube positions.
  7. Calibrated the pipet head. Note: OT2 will attempt to calibrate to position A1 of Media Rack 2, this is expected run proceeded as normal.
  8. Ran protocol  
    1.  Start time  11:36:11 AM
    2.  END TIME 12:14 PM  

    3. Total run time: 00:38:00
  9. Replaced caps and returned tubes to the incubator  13:18

Staining and imaging:  
1\. Prepared stain buffer in 15 mL amber or black tube by combining the
following:

  * 1 mL of dPBS 
  * 1 drop of NucGreen Dead 488 Cell Stain ReadyProbes Sytox Green
    * Vortex mix for ~5 seconds, then stored in dark until ready to use.

  1. Added 100 uL of dPBS + NucGreen solution directly to each well with cells
  2. Added 100 uL of dPBS to columns 3, 4, 9 and 10 according to the below plate map
  3. Perform serial dilution of cells by transferring 100 uL of cell suspension to subsequent well
  4. A third plate (labelled plate 2) was setup according to previous lab entries (1 mL dPBS, 3 drops Hoechst Readyflow, 1 drop Nucgreen Dead 488 cell stain with 100 uL added to cells)
  5. Incubated for 30 minutes in the dark at room temperature Timestamp: 14:37 (Plate 1), 16:12 (plate 2), 17:05 (plate 3)
  6. Made 25% and 12.5% dilutions of the sample in dPBS   

  7. Centrifuged plates at 300 RCF for 1 minute  14:03, 16:42
  8. Plate map of culture IDs in 96-WP for imaging:
