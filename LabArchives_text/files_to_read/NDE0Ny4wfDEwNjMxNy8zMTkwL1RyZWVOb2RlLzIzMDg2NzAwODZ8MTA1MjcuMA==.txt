Growth Media:

  * [x ]  DMEM/F12 + 10% FBS + 1X P/S 




### Process:

1\. Took 2x image of vessel with microscope on phase setting.  

3\. Aliquotted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then
placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath for a minimum of 20 minutes
prior to use: time

  1. TrypLE:    15   mL 
  2.  dPBS (for washing and neutralising):    30  mL 
  3. Growth media (for pellet resuspension):   3  mL 
  4. Growth media (for seeding):  tbd

Time that all aliquots were placed in the water bath the warm before use
11:39

Note: if aliquots were placed in water bath at different time, record the time
stamp for each individual solution.




4\. Removed vessel(s) from the incubator

5\. Washed the vessel(s) with dPBS (warmed).

6\. Added    5   mL tryple to each vessel/well and incubated at 37˚C.

  1. Start/Finish for TrypLE was   11:55 - 12:10   

7\. Neutralised with    50 mL   dPBS and combined cell suspension.

8\. Centrifuged at 650 x g for 5 min.

  1. Start/Finish time for centrifugation was   12:16 - 12:21    




9\. Aspirated the supernatant(s).

10\. Resuspended pellet(s) in   3  mL       growth   media

11\. Aliquoted   20 uL   of resuspended cells into a microcentrifuge tube for
cell count.

12\. Performed a cell count using the haemocytometer and recorded the cell
count data in the Google Doc spreadsheet called 'Cell Count Spreadsheet' (see
link below):

SSIBtIylyrBQE5kRX5Z8NtI/edit#gid=0

  1. Total cell number was:     5,268,000    

  2. Volume of cell suspension required for subculture was:    3 mL (total)     

  3. Cell density per vessel:    7525/cm2     




13\. Transferred    3000  µl of cell suspension to the pre-warmed     120 mL
Growth media:  

14\. Transferred cell suspension into the    4 x T175s  

15\. Transferred vessel(s) to incubate at: 13:10  

  * [x]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (avian cells)

Observations/Summary:  

Cells have proliferated since last checked, however they have a concerning
"bubbly" appearance (see images linked) which may indicate beginning of
sensence. Passaging instead of banking to monitor growth and survival.  

On cell count, a number of cells had a fuzzy looking membrane




### Results:

  * Results were;
    * [x]  As Usual (this is a repetitive task)
    * [ ]  Unexpected because...
    * [ ]  Need to be further analysed
    * [ ]  Other (.......)
