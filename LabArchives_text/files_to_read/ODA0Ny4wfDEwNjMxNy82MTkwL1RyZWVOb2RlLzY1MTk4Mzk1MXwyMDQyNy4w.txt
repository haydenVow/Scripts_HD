RELATED TO OKR:  Please provide the OKR that this EPIC is progressing towards

AIM/PURPOSE: Before starting the experiment, ask yourself: "Does my
experimental design address my proposed aim/purpose?" Pay close attention to
this when reviewing an experimental design as well.

HYPOTHESIS: Before starting the experiment, ask yourself: "Will my
experimental design allow me to support/disprove this hypothesis? Is there
sufficient replicates to ensure statistical significance?" Pay close attention
to this when reviewing an experimental design as well. Please make your
hypothesis specific and measurable.

RESULTS SUMMARY: State the key take-aways from the experiment in 1-2 sentences

CONCLUSIONS: State whether your hypothesis was supported or not. In some
instances, the hypothesis will be less relevant, so this will be less
important (e.g. generating WCBs). If your EPIC is not a hypothesis-driven
research experiment, you can state that this is a "process" in the header's
aim, and indicate "NA" for the hypothesis & conclusions.

NEXT STEPS: Bullet points should be used to indicate what experiments (if any)
will be completed as a direct result of this experiment. In addition, you
should think about how the experiment could be done better next time (e.g. if
I was to repeat this experiment I would include an additional timepoint at day
5 to understand whether the number of Myogenin positive cells decreased before
myotube delamination occurred"

[NOTE: Where appropriate, please indicate WHO will take responsibility and put
a date for completion. (e.g. "James will create an SOP detailing the new
methodology by the end of August 2021" or "Tom will repeat the experiment on
18th November 2021")
