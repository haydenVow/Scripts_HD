Aim/Purpose


Background

Given the initial findings from Mini-tissue optimisation experiments 1-5 in
the multi-well mould design, we will now begin trialling a much larger
circular mould design. This design is intended to be more scaleable and to
allow the generation of much larger tissue constructs in a stackable manner
(see initial write-up here and here). Producing tissues at this scale (6cm
discs) will hopefully allow us to produce a complex, layered textured product.

Findings from experiment 5 have shown that tissues form well between 15 and 60
million cells per mL. As such we will trial tissue disc formation at 30 and 60
million cells per mL, to assess the formation, integrity, thickness and
stability of tissues at these two densities.

Aim

To produce large tissue-engineered tissues in a scaleable, parallelised manner

Hypothesis

Large scale tissue formation will be highly dependent on cell density


Methods and Experiment layout


  

Experiment layout

We will attempt to seed four tissue discs inside printed moulds (Fig.1). Each
disc will be a single replicate (condition). Conditions will be as follows
(also see Fig.2):

  1. 0.1M NaOH used in gel matrix, (conditions to set gel: 37C, 5%CO2)
  2. 0.1M NaOH used in gel matrix, (conditions to set gel: Ambient, 5%CO2)
  3. 0.1M NaOH used in gel matrix, (conditions to set gel: 37C, 5%CO2) with cell resuspension in growth media (listed in table above) with the addition of 1:100 HEPES buffer solution. 
  4. 0.2M NaOH used in gel matrix, (conditions to set gel: 37C, 5%CO2)

Figure 2. Plate Map for Tissue Discs Experiment B, to determine the optimum
acidity levels of large scale tissue disc cultures. There are 4 conditions
(n=1) with the condition details outlined within the figure. All culture will
have a cell density of 40M cells/ml with a gel matrix volume of 25ml.
