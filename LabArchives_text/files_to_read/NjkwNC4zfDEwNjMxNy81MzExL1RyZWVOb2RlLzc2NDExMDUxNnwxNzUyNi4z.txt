Aim/Purpose


To compare suspension adaptation of CHOMP cells in 24 DWP, 50 mL shake tubes,
and E125 flasks.

To test suspension adaption of CHOMP in different medium conditions:


Hypothesis


Cells will adapt to suspension adaption better (higher cells/mL will be
achieved) in E125 flasks than in 24 DWP and 50 mL shake tubes.

CHOMP cells will adapt to suspension in at least one of the media formulations
tested.


Technical Gap


Vow has not tried adapting cells to suspension in 24 deep well plates before.
It is important to compare cell growth in these vessels with E125 flasks
throughout the suspension adaptation process. This will ensure that any
failure to adapt cells is due to cells or media formulations, rather than the
types of vessels used.

This experiment will also help to identify a media formulation for adapting
CHOMP cells so that large scale expansion can occur to create Vow's first
product.

E125 flasks

Seed 3 replicates for each condition, 500 000 cells/mL and shake on MaxQ
shaker (19 mm orbital diameter)

24 DWP: 1.25 M cells in 2.5 mL per well, 300 rpm

50 mL tubes: 2.5 million cells in 5 mL per tube, 206 rpm

Underlined ingredients (including KSR) should be added fresh on the day of
feed.

OT2 Feed

Perform 75% media changes twice per week by centrifuging cell suspensions at
300xg for 5 minutes, discard the supernatant and re-suspend cells in their
respective growth medias. Transfer 100 uL of resuspended sample into 96 well
plate for imaging and cell counts.

Cell counts

Add 100 uL of stain buffer (Hoechst 33342 Readyflow) to the cells and incubate
at room temperature and in the dark for 30 minutes. Prepare serial dilutions
(50%, 25%, 12.5%) of the stained cell preparation in subsequent wells,
diluting with dPBS. Image all wells using the Zaber and analyse using MIA.
