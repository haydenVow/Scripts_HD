### Process:

1\. Took image of vessel with microscope on phase setting

3\. Aliquotted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then
placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath for a minimum of 20 minutes
prior to use:

  1. TrypLE:     30    mL in    1 x 50mL Falcon  tubes
  2.  dPBS (for neutralising):     30    mL
  3.  dPBS (for washing):     30    mL
  4. Growth media (for pellet resuspension):    Included in Seed Media     mL
  5. Growth media (for seeding):    90     mL 

Time that all aliquots were placed in the water bath the warm before use
14:11   a/pm

Note: if aliquots were placed in water bath at different time, record the time
stamp for each individual solution.




4\. Removed vessel(s) from the incubator     14:13   a/pm

5\. Washed the vessel(s) with dPBS (warmed).

6\. Added     10    mL tryple to each vessel/well and incubated at 37˚C and
30C.  

  1. Start/Finish for TrypLE was     14:45 - 14:50   a/pm 

7\. Neutralised with    10    dPBS and combined cell suspension into a
50mL    tube.

8\. Centrifuged at 650 x g for 5 min.

  1. Start/Finish time for centrifugation was     15:02 - 15:07   a/pm 




13\. Transferred      Refer to above widgets     µl of cell suspension to the
pre-warmed      50     mL Growth media:      16:30 (approx)    a/pm

14\. Transferred cell suspension into the pre-gelatin coated     3 x 6 well
plates + T-flask (per species)       vessel.

Remaining cells were put into T75 (CHOMP) and T175 (CHICK) for continous
expansion for other experiments.

16\. Transferred vessel(s) to incubate at:

  * [X]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells) and 30C for CHOMP
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (avian cells)

CHICK cultures in Incubator 52 in Main Lab

CHOMP cultures in Incubator 82 in Main Lab




Observations/Summary:

Cells succesfully passaged from T flasks into 6 well plates. Remaining excess
cells were seeded into T75 and T175 for continous expansion should we need a
supply of cells for further experiments (where Nuvonis is unavailable).

Version Change Log

NameChange Details  
V1 (original)N/A  
V2Changed all sentences to past tense to better reflect a hand-written lab
book entry.  
Various formatting changes.  
Addition of more detail to step 2, removal of step 3. Replaced volume
requirements table with updated volumes @Sep 22, 2020  
Updated temperature selection for mammalian/aviary cells @Sep 23, 2020  
V3Included a section for 'vessel type' in passage ID table Replace
'flask/plate' with 'vessel' throughout lab book Include at step 1 to take
image of vessel on the microscope  
Mentioned that dPBS for washing should be warm - step 3(2) and 5.  
Added timepoint at step 4 for when vessel is removed from incubator  
Include at step 11 to aliquot cell resuspension into microcentrifuge tube  
Included at step 10 and 13 time point for when cell pellet is resuspended and
when resuspended cells is moved into growth media.  
Included p38i in table of regent used  
Combined two dPBS entries in 'Media/reagents' table Added 'cell density per
vessel'
