Process:

1\. Collected 1x24 well plate from clear drawer at bottom of "Media+Gelatin"
fridge in main lab labelled "LL SAT". Removed parafilm and placed in incubator
for at least 20 minutes 10:12

2\. Retrieved culture plate from Thermo incubator (large glass incubator).
Using a gloved, well-ethanoled hand, carefully lifted out the inserts by the
edges

3\. Placed inserts with zein scaffolds into new 24 well plate with warmed E6
medium. Use lid from previous plate for new culture to avoid re-printing
culture ID label.

4\. Returned vessel to incubate at:

  * [X]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (aviary cells)
