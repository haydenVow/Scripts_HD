Growth Media:

  * [x]  DMEM/F12 + 20% FBS + 1X P/S + P38i (10uM)

Total media required: 1x45mL (For E125s) 1x30mL (for 50mL tubes)

Total p38i required: 1x22.5uL (for E125s), 1x15uL (for 50mL tubes.




Process:

[18/june/21] Aliquotted   1x45mL and 1x30  mL of  growth Media into  2x50mL
tube(s). placed in the fridge (#74, under biostat) in the main lab at 4
degrees overnight.

1\. Removed aliquots from the fridge and added of P38 inhibitor to each tube
see volumes to add above.

2\. Placed in water bath   8:15 am

3\. Removed  50%  % of supernatant from vessel (15mL).

4\. Replaced with  15 mL (per well/per vessel) of  growth   media.

5\. Returned vessel to incubate at:

  * [x]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (aviary cells)

Incubator #78 library lab.
