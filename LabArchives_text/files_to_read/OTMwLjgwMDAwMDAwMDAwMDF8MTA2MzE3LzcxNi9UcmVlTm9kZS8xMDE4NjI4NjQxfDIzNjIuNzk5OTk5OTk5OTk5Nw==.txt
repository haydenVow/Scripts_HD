 ~~Finished sterility test~~

  1.  ~~Took a sample and transfer it to the well of a well plate.~~
  2.  ~~Observed the sample under the microscope.~~

NotesSigns of contamination include cloudy culture medium, motile particles
visible under the 60x or 100x objective.  
  
NOT CONDUCTED DUE TO NEED TO SEED IMMEDIATELY AFTER SETUP  
  
  
  




 ~~Calibrated dissolved oxygen probe~~

  1.  ~~Ran the calibration routine as per the operating manual~~
    1.  ~~Sparged nitrogen gas at high flow rate and with high impeller speed until dissolved oxygen reading equilibrated at a very low level.~~
    2.  ~~Set that level as 0%~~
    3.  ~~Sparged air at high flow rate and with high impeller speed until dissolved oxygen reading equilibrated at a high level.~~
    4.  ~~Set that level as 100%~~

Set level probe

  1. Loosened the nut around the antifoam/level probe.
  2. Gently rotated and pulled the probe out until it reached the desired height.
  3. Tightened the nut until finger tight.

NotesNEVER push the probe back into the bioreactor after autoclaving as this
can introduce contamination.

Configured the operating parameters

  1. Configured dissolved oxygen control cascade.
  2. Configured pH control.
  3. Configured level control.
  4. Configured feed schedule.
  5. Switched all accessories to "Automatic".

Seeded the batch

  1. Thoroughly wiped down the seed bottle and corresponding line from the bioreoactor with 70% ethanol.
  2. Placed the seed bottle and the end of the seed line in the BSC next to the bioreactor.
  3. Aseptically transferred the seed cells to the seed bottle.
  4. Make an aseptic connection between the bottle and the bioreactor seed line.
  5. Pumped the seed cells into the bioreactor.

Set intermittent stirring schedule:

  1. Set STIRR PROFILE to stirr for 2 minutes every half hour for 4 hours.
  2. Set STIRR to PROFILE (not AUTOMATIC).

NotesThe maximum number of profile points is 32, so intermittent stirring can
only be set for up to 4 hours using a square wave speed profile.  
The speed in the first profile should be 0. If the speed in the first profile
point is greater than 0, the stirrer will gradually increase in speed to this
speed, rather than jumping up to to that speed at that time.
