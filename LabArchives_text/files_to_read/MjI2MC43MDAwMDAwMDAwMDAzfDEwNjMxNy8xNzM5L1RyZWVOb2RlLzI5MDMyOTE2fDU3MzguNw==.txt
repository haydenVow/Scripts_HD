Experimental timeline

[Day - 2] 09/06 Wed: Thaw C2C12 and seed onto 2 x 96 wp - seeding density of 5
K- 7K per well.

[Day - 1]  10/06 Thurs: Feed with GM - Check plate for confluency. If
confluent (>70%) then change to E6, otherwise feed with growth media. + Prep
E6 media with creatine concentration of 0, 1, 5, 10 mM.

Media requirement's:

  * 30mL per day. (7.5 mL to feed 4 columns (one condition) of 2 x 96wp)

For 7 days of feed:

  * E6 media - 52.5 mL  
  * 1mM creatine + E6 media - 52.5 mL  
  * 5mM creatine + E6 media - 52.5 mL  
  * 10mM creatine + E6 media - 52.5 mL  

Method:

  * Prep 100 mL of 10 mM creatine stock solution by dissolving 131.13mg of creatine with 100 mL E6 media. 
  * Prepare 10 mM by sterile filtering 52.5 mL of creatine stock media between 7 x sterile urine container
  * Prepare 5 mM by sterile filtering 26.25 mL of creatine stock media and 26.25 mL of E6 of media between 7 x sterile urine container
  * Prepare 1 mM by sterile filtering 5.25 mL of creatine stock media and 47.25 mL of E6 of media between 7 x sterile urine container
