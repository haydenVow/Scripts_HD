RELATED TO MILESTONE: Milestone 2:

AIM/PURPOSE: To assess whether it is possible to obtain viable ECM scaffold
sheets (evidenced by scaffold thickness and structural integrity) derived from
fibroblasts cultured under different culture conditions.

HYPOTHESIS: From at least two of the culture conditions tested in this
experiment we will be able to harvest structurally intact, stable fibroblast
cell sheets, which we will subsequently decellularise and use as ECM scaffolds
for MuSCs (see next experiment).  

RESULTS SUMMARY: See report

CONCLUSIONS: This investigation focused on achieving successful creation of
fibroblast cell sheets and we found that only two conditions of the total
eight tested could result in fibroblast ECM sheets of sufficient viability to
serve as scaffolds to seed MuSC onto, however additional experimentation is
required to refine this process of generating fibroblast cell sheets.  

NEXT STEPS:

  * Test the formation of fibroblast cell sheets during a six week culture period.
  * Evaluate the impact of different coating solutions or substrates such as higher concentration gelatin coating, plastic substrates or thermo-responsive polymers on fibroblast sheet formation. 
  * Continue experiment with chosen scaffolds and seed with MuSC to assess adherence and differentiation over 14 days (see next experiment).
