Figure 1: Mean cell counts across 5 different feeding conditions (100% / 50% /
0% with media changed daily or every second day, ESD) over 10 days of
differentiation for DOLLY12 WCB cells in E6 (top) and 2% HS (bottom)
differentiation media. Error bars show standard error of mean, with N = 4 for
each data point.




Figure 2: Normalised MyoG count (calculated by dividing the MyoG count by the
DAPI count) across 5 different feeding conditions over 10 days of
differentiation for DOLLY12 WCB cells in E6 (top) and 2% HS (bottom)
differentiation media. Error bars show standard error of mean, with N = 4 for
each data point.

Note: Due to the low DAPI count in the wells fed with 100% HS every second day
(blue bar graph), the effect of normalisation has been amplified. This should
be regarded as an artefact.




Figure 3: Normalised MF20 area (calculated by dividing the %myotube well area
by the DAPI count) across 5 different feeding conditions over 10 days of
differentiation for DOLLY12 WCB cells in E6 (top) and 2% HS (bottom)
differentiation media. Error bars show standard error of mean, with N = 4 for
each data point.

Note: Due to the low DAPI count in the wells fed with 100% HS every second day
(blue bar graph), the effect of normalisation has been amplified. This should
be regarded as an artefact.
