Process:

1\. Aliquotted   1.5mL  mL of  E6 Media  and   1.5mL  mL of  2% HS Diff media
into  2x15mL     tube(s). Placed in incubator at  

2\. Removed 96 well plates from top binder incubator (#67, top shelf). Removed
100 % of Growth Media from each well on the 96 well plates.  

3\. Replaced with  150uL (per well) of  Diff   media.

  * Top row (E6 media) 
  * Bottom row (2% HS media). 

4\. Returned plates to incubate at: [10:07am]

  * [x]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (aviary cells)
  * incubator #67.
