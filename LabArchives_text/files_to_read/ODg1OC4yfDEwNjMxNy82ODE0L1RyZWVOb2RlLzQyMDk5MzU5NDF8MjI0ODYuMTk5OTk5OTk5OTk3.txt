Note

Due to time contraints, cell counts were not performed for this passage.
Instead, they each culture being passaged was given a 1:3 split, so were
passaged from a T175 to 3x T175s.




### Process for Passage:

  1. Took image of vessel with microscope on phase setting and determined if cultures should be passaged for given a 50% feed (see notes in table)
  2. Aliquoted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath for a minimum of 20 minutes prior to use
  3. Removed vessel(s) from the incubator
  4. Washed the vessel(s) with dPBS (warmed).
  5. Added    10    mL tryple to each vessel/well and incubated at 37˚C for 12min (checked after 10min, then incubated for a further 2min until >90% of cells were detached).
  6. Neutralised with    10      dPBS and combined cell suspension into      50ml   tubes.
  7. Centrifuged at 650 x g for 5 min.
  8. Aspirated the supernatant(s).
  9. Resuspended each pellet(s) in      50 mL/tube    respective growth  medias  

  10. Re-seeded 3 x T175 for each culture, 30mL per vessel.   

  11. Transferred vessel(s) to incubate:   
37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)  
Incubator #138, Library Lab  
  




Process for feed

  1. Growth media pre-warmed to 37C, by placing in the water bath for >15min.
  2. Cultures removed from the incubator and placed in the BSC
  3. 50% of the growth media removed from each vessel (15mL)
  4. Media replaced with 15mL of each cultures growth medium
  5. Returned to the cell culture incubator, Library Lab #138, 37C and 5% CO2.  
  




Observations/Summary:  
Cells cultured in KSR were clumpy Could not be broken apart with a 1mL
pipette.
