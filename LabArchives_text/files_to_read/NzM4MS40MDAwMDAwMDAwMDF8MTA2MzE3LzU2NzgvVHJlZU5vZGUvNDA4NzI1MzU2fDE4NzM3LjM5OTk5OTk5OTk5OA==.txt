RELATED TO OKR:  Non KR

AIM/PURPOSE: The overarching goal is to expand the Vows existing cell library
to include a broader range of species. Here, we aim to isolate a plastic
adherent population of cells from wallaby muscle tissue (which we will refer
to as WALLE cells). These cells will then be expanded to form a master cell
bank (MCB) and working cell bank (WCB).

HYPOTHESIS:

  1. ≥12 Vials of WALLE crude homogenate will be frozen down following Vows established protocols for cell isolation.
  2. Plastic adherent populations of cells will be established via immediate culture of WALLE crude homogenate. 
  3. The plastic adherent population of WALLE cells will be expanded in culture to an MCB of ≥ 15M cells. 

RESULTS SUMMARY:

  1. Due to the Wallaby sample arriving at the Vowse frozen, only 1 biopsy was collected and processed into crude homogenate. The entire homogenate was then placed into immediate culture. 
  2. The hypothesis was not supported. We were unable to establish an adherent population of cells via immediate culture of WALLE crude homogenate.
  3.  The hypothesis was not supported as we were unable to expand our cultures to an MCB of ≥ 15M cells as we did not successfully establish a population of plastic adherent cells. 

CONCLUSIONS:

The isolation and culture of viable cells from the WALLE biopsy was
unsuccessful. This was most likely due the meat arriving at the Vowse frozen,
which would have greatly limited the cells viability.

NEXT STEPS:  
Another Wallaby sample should be sourced to repeat the biopsy and isolation.
The wallaby farm/ processors should be reminded not to freeze the meat prior
to shipping.
