## Quickly determining whether nylon scaffolds will distort from sterilisation
and during scaffold cell culture experiments

## Performed by: JesiD, James H, VarshanaB

## Aim:

To determine whether nylon scaffolds will distort or absorb significant
volumes of fluid, to ensure it is a viable material for use in cell culture
experiments for the 'mini-tissue' project.

## Hypothesis:

The nylon scaffold will absorb very minimal volumes of fluid and will not
distort when autoclaved.

## Method:

1\. The nylon scaffold was placed in a bath of 70% ethanol within a 20cm petri
dish

2\. The edges of the petri dish were wrapped with parafilm and placed in a dry
location for 24 hours. 13:15 31 May 2022 - 12:30 01 Jun. 2022  
3\. The scaffold was removed from the EtOH bath and weighed. Then, a dry
control nylon scaffold was also weighed and the difference was compared.

4\. A dry scaffold was placed in the autoclave to determine whether the high
pressure and heat sterilisation process distorts the scaffold. 4.30pm 6 Jun.

Measurement:

  * The ethanol-soaked scaffold was approximately 2grams heavier than the control dry scaffold. 
  * No size variation following a autoclave sterilisation cycle. 

## Results:

  * The nylon scaffold absorbs minimum volumes of fluid and does not distort when undergoing a sterilisation cycle. 

## Conclusion:

From this experiment we found the nylon scaffold does not distort and does not
absorb large volumes of fluid. Thus, it is a viable scaffold mould to use in
cell culture.  
  
Moving forward to ensure optimal sterilisation we have implemented a series of
steps to avoid contamination. This is especially crucial given we cannot
autoclave petri-dishes spin-coated with PDMS (which is the sealant for the
scaffold). The sterilisation steps we will be including moving forward:

  * After attaching the scaffold to a petri dish (with PDMS) submerge the scaffold in a bath of 70% EtOH 24hrs before using for an experiment. 
  * On the day of use: dry the scaffolds (upside down) in a BSC for 1 hour. 
  * After drying in the BSC, UV irradiate for 1 hour.
