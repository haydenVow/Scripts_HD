Process:

1\. Aliquotted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then
placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath for a minimum of 20 minutes
prior to use:

  1. TrypLE:    30   mL in  1 x 50ml   tubes
  2. dPBS (for neutralising)    30   mL in   1 x 70ml     tubes
  3. Growth media (for seeding):    150   mL in   2 x 120ml (75mL per continer)    tubes




2\. Washed the flask(s) with dPBS.

3\. Added   5    mL tryple to each vessel/well and incubated at 37˚C for    8
min.

Note: Fibroblasts typically require 15-18 minutes of incubation with tryple,
slightly longer than MuSCs.

4\. Neutralised with    5   dPBS (warmed) and combined cell suspension into 5
x    50 ml   tube.

5\. Centrifuged at 400 x g for 5 min.




6\. Aspirated the supernatant(s)

7\. Resuspended pellet(s) in      1  mL PBS.

8\. Performed a cell count using the haemocytometer, mixing 1:1 with trypan
blue. Recorded the cell count data in the Google Doc spreadsheet called 'Cell
Count Spreadsheet' (see link below):

10\. Seeded ~7000k cells per cm2 of the flasks/plates Note that fibroblasts
prefer to be subcultured closely together.

12\. Transferred volumes of cell suspension (see above) to separate pre-warmed
growth media containing T flasks.

14\. Transfer flask/plate(s) to incubate at:

  * [ ]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (aviary cells)
  * [x]  30ºC, 5% CO2 (aviary cells), incubator 120

Transferred the remaining volume of each cell of the suspensions to separate
1.5mL eppendorf tubes

centrifuged tubes for 5 minutes at 500g.

Removed supernatant and left raw pellet in each tube. Placed all 4 tubes in a
yellow top lid 50mL container, labelled with the date, epic number and
knockout conditions.

Placed this yellow lid container in the bottom shelf of the -80 freezer in the
library lab for future RNA extractions.
