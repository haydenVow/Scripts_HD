Aim/Purpose


Perform a minimum effort (no imaging, staining, or picking until day 30
following sorting) suspension SCC run of CHOMP_09 fibroblasts in 384 ULA
plates.


Hypothesis


CHOMP_09 fibroblasts sorted in 384 ULA wells will survive and proliferate in
static suspension such that we will attain ≥1 suspension adapted cell
population.

In addition, modifying the current cloning protocols with the inclusion of
alternative feeding strategies (feed every 10 days vs no feed), seeding
density (1 cell vs 5 cells per well) and reduced imaging will maximise the
chance of attaining ≥1 suspension adapted cell population with minimal effort.


Technical Gap


Preliminary results with CHOMP_09 fibroblasts indicate that these cells are
able to survive and proliferate in 384 ULA plates, following FACS sorting and
seeding. However current protocols for SCC involve imaging and/or staining
culture plates at several instances during the SCC process. Given that these
CHOMP cells were not observed until day 24 indicates that if any viable
population arises after being sorted into 384 ULA plates it will be after a
minimum of 30 days. Therefore following FACS sorting these plates will remain
in culture for a minimum of 30 days, with intermittent media feeds and
observed/stained at day 30 to confirm the presence of cell populations, if
any.


Method/Procedure


Media conditions:

  * RPMI + 20% FBS + 1X P/S + ACA (1:100) + 0.1% pluronic + FGF (10 ng/mL) + IGFLR3 (100 ng/mL) + 4 mM glutamax 
  * Hycell CHO + 20% KSR + 1X P/S + FGF (10 ng/mL) + IGFLR3 (100 ng/mL) + 4 mM glutamax 
  * CD CHO + 20% KSR + 1X P/S + FGF (10 ng/mL) + IGFLR3 (100 ng/mL) + 4 mM glutamax 
  * RPMI + 20% KSR + 1X P/S + ACA (1:100) + 0.1% pluronic \+ FGF (10 ng/mL) + IGFLR3 (100 ng/mL) + 4 mM glutamax 
  * FreeStyle CHO + 8mM L-Glutamine + 1X P/S (for CHO-S only)  
  
*CD-CHO and Hycell CHO already contain ACA and pluronic so it is not necessary to add those components. 

Cell types:

  * Adherent CHOMP_09 fibroblasts thawed from a WCB vial and grown in adherent culture for 6 days prior to the FACS sort
  * CHO-S cells thawed from an MCB vial currently in liquid nitrogen

Feed strategy:

  * Every 10 days
  * No feed for the entire 30 day culturing period

Cell density:

  * 1 cell per well
  * 5 cells per well

Possible permutations for a single media condition (using RPMI + FBS as an
example):

  1. RPMI + FBS  1 cell  feed every 10 days (CHOMP fibroblast)
  2. RPMI + FBS  5 cells  feed every 10 days (CHOMP fibroblast) 
  3. RPMI + FBS  1 cell no feed (CHOMP fibroblast) 
  4. RPMI + FBS  5 cells (CHOMP fibroblast) 

Therefore a total of 4 permutations per media condition. Consequently, as
there are a total of 4 media conditions, there can be a total of 16
conditions. An additional condition will be a CHO-S control plate, bringing
the total to 17 plates. The other three will be replicates of the RPMI + FBS
media condition (given that we have seen that this is promising) for a total
of 20 plates (see below for all experimental conditions).

  

Experimental conditions:

RPMI + FBS

RPMI + KSR

Hycell CHO

CD-CHO

Freestyle CHO

*As we currently only have 1 ULA plate in house only 1 of the 20 conditions will be tested using those plates (i.e. plate 1). The remainder will be coated with the anti adherence rinsing solution prior to FACS sorting and seeding.

7-Dec-2021D-0Revive 2M x F_CHOMP09 cells and seed 2x T175These flasks will be
harvested on the day of the sort to be seeded into the 384 well plates

13-Dec-2021D-5/D-0Prepare additional 19x 384 well plates (non-tissue culture
treated, with black walls) with Anti-adherent rinsing solution to prevent
cellular attachment (Plates 2-20)  
*Perform process in non-tissue culture treated 384 plates  
  
  
NOTE: For all cell types, Anti-Adherence Rinsing Solution is required during
plate preparation steps to ensure optimal performance. Anti-Adherence Rinsing
Solution prevents cell adhesion and promotes efficient EB and spheroid
formation.  
  
  
1. Warm basal medium (i.e. RPMI, CD-CHO, Hycell, etc) and complete medium (RPMI + FBS/KSR/PS etc).  
  
2. Pre-treat 384 wells with Anti-Adherence Rinsing Solution as described below.  
a. Add Anti-Adherence Rinsing Solution to each well to be used, as follows:  
• 384-well plate: 20 µL  
• 24-well plate: 500 µL  
• 6-well plate: 2 mL  
b. Centrifuge plate at 1300 x g for 5 minutes in a swinging bucket rotor
fitted with plate holders. NOTE: Plates must be well balanced. Prepare a
balance plate using a standard plate filled with water to match the weight and
position of the plate.  
c. Observe plate under a microscope to ensure that bubbles have been removed
from microwells. If bubbles remain trapped in any microwells, centrifuge at
1300 x g for an additional 5 minutes.  
d. Aspirate Anti-Adherence Rinsing Solution from the wells.  
  
3. Rinse each well with warm basal medium, as follows:  
• 384-wellplate: 50 µL  
• 24-wellplate: 2 mL  
• 6-wellplate: 5 mL  
  
4. Aspirate medium from the well.  
  
5. Add warm complete medium to each well to be used, as follows:  
• 384-wellplate: 50 µL  
• 24-wellplate: 1 mL  
• 6-wellplate: 2.5 m

13-Dec-2021D0 FACS sort into 20 x 384-well plates:

*Note plates will have been prefilled with complete growth medium in the previous step (for all the growth media conditions used in this experiment refer to the top of this section)  
  
1. Prepare plates are described in the step above

2. Prepare 20 mL of FACS Buffer (PRF DMEM/F12 + 2% FBS)

3. Harvest fibroblast from 2x T175s

4. Take to Garvan and sort (1 cell will be sorted per well). Garvan sort protocol here (under Day 7)  
*Previous SCC run typically sort 15 cells into each corner well, however these are primarily used as a reference when imaging and since these plates will not be imaged until day 30 it is not required. 

5. Transport plates back to Vowse and place in incubator at 30'C 5% CO2
