### Process:

1\. Took image of vessel with microscope on phase setting.

3\. Aliquotted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then
placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath for a minimum of 20 minutes
prior to use:

  1. TrypLE:    15     mL in     1    tubes
  2.  dPBS (for neutralising):     10mL in 1 x tube, 5mL in 1 x tube    mL
  3.  dPBS (for washing):      10mL in 1 x tube, 5mL in 1 x tube   mL
  4. Growth media (for pellet resuspension):     10mL 10% FBS for DOLLY cells, 4mL 20% FBS for CHOMP cells    mL
  5. Growth media (for seeding):     30mL 10% FBS, 30mL 20% FBS, 4 x 15mL 10% FBS, 2 x 15mL 20% FBS, 4 x 2.5mL 10% FBS    mL 

Time that all aliquots were placed in the water bath the warm before use
11:01 pm

Note: if aliquots were placed in water bath at different time, record the time
stamp for each individual solution.




4\. Removed vessel(s) from the incubator     :   a/pm

5\. Washed the vessel(s) with dPBS (warmed).

6\. Added     10mL (F_DOLLY12) and 5mL (F_CHOMP9)    mL tryple to each
vessel/well and incubated at 37˚C.

  1. Start/Finish for TrypLE was     11:23 - 11:35 pm 

7\. Neutralised with    10mL (F_DOLLY12) and 5mL (F_CHOMP9)    dPBS and
combined cell suspension into a    1 X 50mL tube (F_DOLLY12) and 1 x 15mL tube
(F_CHOMP9)   tube.

8\. Centrifuged at 650 x g for 5 min.

  1. Start/Finish time for centrifugation was    : pm 




9\. Aspirated the supernatant(s).

10\. Resuspended pellet(s) in      10mL (DOLLY12) and 4mL (F_CHOMP9)   mL
respective growth media    media    12:02 pm

11\. Aliquoted     10uL     of resuspended cells into a microcentrifuge tube
for cell count.

12\. Performed a cell count using the haemocytometer and recorded the cell
count data in the Google Doc spreadsheet: Cell Count Spreadsheet or cell count
widget below

  1. Transferred 2.8mL of F_DOLLY12 cell suspension to the pre-warmed 30mL of DMEM/F12 + 10% FBS + 1X P/S and into 1 x T175 flask
  2. Transferred 2.1mL of F_CHOMP9 cell suspension to the pre-warmed 30mL of DMEM/F12 + 20% FBS + 1X P/S and into 1 x T175 flask

Transferred DOLLY12 flask into 37C incubator (#68 - Library lab)

Transferred CHOMP9 flask into 30C incubator (#77 - Library lab)  
12:20 pm




Remaining cells left at 4C in fridge 12:20 pm

Add cell count data to this spreadsheet; it will calculate the volume of cells
+ media needed to seed cells into each condition:

Cells successfully seeded into 8 x 384-well plates and 6 x 96-well plates.

Row H of the 96-well plates contain F_CHOMP9 cells. All other wells contain
F_DOLLY12 cells.

16\. Transferred vessel(s) to incubate at:

  * [ X ]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (avian cells)

Version Change Log

NameChange Details  
V1 (original)N/A  
V2Changed all sentences to past tense to better reflect a hand-written lab
book entry.  
Various formatting changes.  
Addition of more detail to step 2, removal of step 3. Replaced volume
requirements table with updated volumes @Sep 22, 2020  
Updated temperature selection for mammalian/aviary cells @Sep 23, 2020  
V3Included a section for 'vessel type' in passage ID table Replace
'flask/plate' with 'vessel' throughout lab book Include at step 1 to take
image of vessel on the microscope
