Hoecsht Reagent Preparation:

Prepare 1ml per well for 24well plates, and 100ul per well for 96 well plates.
Use Hoechst at 20ul/mL.

  




# Procedure

  

Aliquoted sufficient volume of relevant medias for Hoechst staining         ml
and placed in the waterbath at 37'C         \-  

  1. Prepared Hoechst stain by adding        uL of Hoechst to         uL of pre-warmed respective growth media (check what wells are in what media)
  2. Sterile filtered Hoechst solution using a syringe filter 
  3. Remove plate from incubator and place in the BSC 
  4. Transfer scaffolds, using a sterile tweezers or needle into a new plate.  
  5. Cover wells with         mL of Hoechst media and incubate cells at 37 degrees for 10 minutes. (Away from light)
  6. Replaced with        fresh growth media for imaging 
  7. Imaged using Zaber microscope 

  

  




Imaging

  1. After incubation, the plate was placed under the Zaber microscope for imaging under the DAPI channel, 5x objective (see template for imaging here: https://au-mynotebook.labarchives.com/share/Vow%2520-%2520Team%2520Science/MTI3Mi43fDEwNjMxNy85NzkvVHJlZU5vZGUvMzEwOTgyMDE0MnwzMjMwLjc=)  
NOTE - If imaging live cells which have been hoechst stained keep samples
sterile, and only have 50ul of media per sample to prevent sample floating
(effects z-stack)

  2. Captured 1x image for each well, return plate to the incubator and using sterile tweezers flip the samples and then re-image using the zaber
  3. Once images have been stitches write notes on observations in the table below - copy and paste images and details below
  4. If fixed and DAPI stained cover the plate with foil and store in the fridge (4'C) until images deemed final
  5. If live cells (hoechst stained) add pre-warmed media to each sample and return plate to the incubator for continual culture (37'C, 5% CO2)
