Process:

1\. Remove plate 7411 (37C, 5% CO2) & 7412 (28C, 0% CO2) from the bottom
incubator in library lab. Look at plate under the microscope, and take images
at 10x magnification if you see cells adhered to the base of the wells.

2\. Aliquot 6mL 'crocodile food' from fridge 104 and place in water bath to 37
degrees 12:36 pm  

3\. Plate 7411: Check under microscope to check for contamination or attached
cells. Please image cells on 10x magnification if you see any adhered to the
plate.  

4\. Plate 7411: Remove 0.5mL media from each well, without removing tissue
chunks.

5\. Plate 7411: Gently topped up media by slowly adding 0.5mL GM to side of
well, taking care not to dislodge chunks from the bottom of the plate.

6\. returned 7411 to incubator at 37C with 5% CO2 12:59 pm

Leave media out at RT to allow it to cool to ~28C.

7\. Plate 7412: Check under microscope to check for contamination or attached
cells. Please image cells on 10x magnification if you see any adhered to the
plate.  

8\. Plate 7412: Remove 0.5mL media from each well, without removing tissue
chunks.

9\. Plate 7412: Gently topped up media by slowly adding 0.5mL GM to side of
well, taking care not to dislodge chunks from the bottom of the plate.

106\. returned 7412 to incubator at 28C with no CO2 13:13 pm  

  




Observations/Summary:

CHOMP9 cells fed with M199 + 15% FBS + 1X P/S media and returned to incubate
at:

1) 37C, 5% CO2

2) 28C, 0% CO2
