WCB2s containing some cells expanded in planar cultureware and some expanded
in microcarrier culture were prepared from the DOLLY12_11E7 clone. We need to
demonstrate that the microcarrier WCB2 cells expand at least as fast as the
planar cultureware cells, and that cells from both the planar cultureware and
microcarrier cultures differentiate and fuse normally.
