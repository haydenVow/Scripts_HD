Process:

1\. Aliquotted   25mL  mL of  growth Media into  1x50mL     tube(s). Placed in
water bath   15:28 a/pm

2\. Removed   50 % of supernatant from each well, a new tip was used for each
well.

3\. Replaced with  0.25 mL (per well) of  pre warmed growth   media.

4\. Returned vessel to incubate at:

  * [x]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (aviary cells)

  

  * Incubator (#78  ), Lab [Library]
