Egg sources

Due to the time of year, it was not possible to source the majority of eggs
from commercial farms, and instead they were purchased from back yard
breeders. Of note, eggs laid out of season are likely to have lower fertile
than those collected during peak breeding season.

Incubation Period before cell isolation.

The day at which we aim to isolate cells is calculated 1/3 of the total
natural incubation time. Early isolation should in theory allow us to take
full advantage of embryonic cells high proliferation rate, and increased
amenability to suspension adaption. By 1/3 normal incubation, the embryos will
already have developed a rudimentary form of all of its all anatomical
features. This is advantageous because in future, it will allow us to extract
any cell type that we desire from the frozen homogenate.
