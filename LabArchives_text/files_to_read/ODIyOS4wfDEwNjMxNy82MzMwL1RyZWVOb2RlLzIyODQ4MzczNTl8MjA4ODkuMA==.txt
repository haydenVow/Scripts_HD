Prepare materials for thaw and seed:

1\. Aliquoted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then
placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath for a minimum of 20 minutes
prior to use:

  * CHOMP growth medium (for seeding 1 x T175): 30 mL
  * CHOMP growth medium (for re-suspending and counting): 4 mL   




## Thaw and seed vials:

2\. Collected the cryovial from Liquid Nitrogen storage & place in foam
floater in water bath for max 5 min

Location where cryovial was collected from:

Vial details: 1 x CHOMP09 cryovial at  2M  cells respectively

Brew

Tower/Bucket #5

Box/Cane #5

Vial location: D2, D3  

Vial ID(s): see table above

``3\. Ethanol sprayed & transferred the vial(s) to the BSC.

4\. Added 500 µL of Growth Media from re-suspension media aliquots to
respective cryovial, resuspended the cell suspensions gently to reduce osmotic
shock.

5\. Collected entire cell suspensions & transferred back into the pre-warmed
respective tubes of growth media.

6\. Gently resuspended and evenly distributed cells and documented exactly how
much medium is in each final cell suspension.

7\. Received CHO-S cells from this thaw [INSERT LINK]

8\. Performed cell count. CHOMP count: CHO-S count:

9\. Aliquoted following for XTT & alamarBlue assay testing:

  * 2 x CHO-S aliquots of 400,000 cells  
  * 2 x CHO-S aliquots of 6,400 cells 
  * 2 x F_CHOMP aliquots of 400,000 cells 
  * 2 x F_CHOMP aliquots of 6,400 cells 

10\. Added 1.1 M (all leftover) CHOMP cells to 30 mL growth medium aliquot and
seeded 1 x T175.

11\. Added 4.1 M (all leftover) CHO-S cells to 30 mL growth medium aliquot and
seeded 1 x E-125. Set to shake at 120 RPM.

12\. Transfered flask/plate(s) to incubate at:

  * [x]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * [x]  30ºC, 5% CO2 (reptilian cells)
