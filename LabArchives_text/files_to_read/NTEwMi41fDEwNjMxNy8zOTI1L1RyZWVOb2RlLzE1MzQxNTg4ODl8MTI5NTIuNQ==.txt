Aim/Purpose: To understand the factors that work together to support adaptation of cells to suspension culture
Hypothesis: We hypothesise DoE can be used to most quickly adapt cells to suspension.
Technical Gap: We've never completed a DoE using suspension culture at Vow. In addition, we do not know how species, basal media, anti-clumping agent, pluronic, KSR, and FBS interact to support or inhibit suspension culture.
Method/Procedure


Experimental Plan:  
  
Day 1:  
  
Step 1: Make up the following 18 media mixes as per the DoE

1\. RPMI + 1:200 anti-clumping agent + 0.1% Pluronic + 10% KSR + 10% FBS

2\. DMEM/F12 + 1:200 anti-clumping agent

3\. RPMI + 1:100 anti-clumping agent + 0.05% Pluronic + 10% KSR + 10% FBS

4\. DMEM/F12 + 0.05% Pluronic

5\. DMEM/F12 + 1:100 anti-clumping agent + 5% KSR + 10% FBS

6\. RPMI + 0.05% Pluronic + 5% KSR

7\. RPMI + 1:100 anti-clumping agent + 5% FBS

8\. DMEM/F12 + 0.1% Pluronic + 10% KSR + 5% FBS

9\. RPMI + 1:100 anti-clumping agent + 0.1% Pluronic

10\. DMEM/F12 + 10% KSR + 10% FBS

11\. RPMI + 1:100 anti-clumping agent + 10% KSR - problem with making up
medium, only has ~120-125 mL in it. Will wait to see how much we have left of
everything before determining what is missing.

12\. DMEM/F12 + 0.1% Pluronic + 10% FBS

13\. DMEM/F12 + 1:100 anti-clumping agent + 0.1% Pluronic + 10% FBS

14\. RPMI + 10% KSR

15\. DMEM/F12 + 1:100 anti-clumping agent + 0.1% Pluronic + 10% KSR

16\.  RPMI + 10% FBS

17\. DMEM/F12 + 1:200 anti-clumping agent + 0.05% Pluronic + 5% KSR + 5% FBS

18\. RPMI + 1:200 anti-clumping agent + 0.05% Pluronic + 5% KSR + 5% FBS  
  
If making media for multiple days/the whole adaptation period (I recommend
this), then after making the media, aliquot 15mL of each media into a separate
tube & store the remaining media. 3 million of the appropriate cell type
should be thawed into 15mL of each media.  
  
Step 2: Thaw 27 million DOLLY12 WCB cells (passage 7). Use Production's big
vials ideally, to keep cells consistent Re-suspend the cells at 200k cells per
mL in 15mL of each of the 9 different medias which indicate that they should
recieve DOLLY12 cells. (This is 3 million cells per tube of media mixed
above). Mix the cell suspension, then place 5mL of cell suspension in each of
three 50mL bioreactor spin tubes. Place the spin tubes on a shaking platform
at standard RPMs.  
  
Step 3: Thaw 14 million NANDO R&D cells (passage 4). Re-suspend cells at ~100k
per mL in 15mL of each of the 9 different medias which indicate that they
should recieve NANDO cells. (This is 1.5 million cells per tube of media mixed
above). Mix the cell suspension, then place 5mL of cell suspension in each of
the three 50mL bioreactor spin tubes. Place the spin tubes on a shaking
platform at standard RPMs. Note: We do not have enough NANDO cells to thaw 27
million, unfortunately. The R&D cells are at passage 4, so earlier stage than
the DOLLY12 WCB as well, so there are going to be unavoidable differences in
cell type anyway. We only have 24 million DOLLY12 MCB at passage 5 and given
how much we are relying on those cells for production's WCBs right now, I am
hesitant to use a lot of them.  
  
Perform media changes and counts every 4 days, as is standard. I suggest you
make up sufficient media for at least 2 weeks, and doing it for 4 weeks may
make the most sense. I don't think there is anything in there that will expire
after 1 week.  
  
Proposed concentrations:  
-1 is always indicative of 0

0 is the midpoint between +1 and -1.

+1 is the high concentration of a given ingredient.

  

Anti-clumping agent: 0, 1:200, 1:100  
Pluronic: 0, 0.05%, 0.1%  
KSR: 0, 5%, 10%  
Serum: 0, 5%, 10%
