Matrix formation for scaffold seeding - 5 cell densities + cell-free control

N.B. Repeat this gel formation for each falcon tube at the same time - i.e.
Add Collagen to all, then add DMEM to all etc. - BUT be sure to move quickly!
Refer to Figure 2 to visualise the workflow.

1. Remove pluronic from the wells.

stripette (not resuspending):

3\. Add 10xDMEM/F12 and mix with stripette.

4\. Add 0.1M Sodium Hydroxide and mix with stripette:

5\. Seed    4mL    gel/matrix gently into scaffold ensuring good distribution
around pillars in the well.

6. Leave for    60-90    minutes to gel at 37°C - start time   17:34  

7\. Add     ~180L   Media to entire 15mL dish, ensure entire mould is covered.

8. Culture at 37°C overnight before checking.

Tips and Tricks for this protocol:

  * When pelleting cells, make sure they are completely dry
  * Flick pellet to dislodge before adding medium
  * Add Medium first to pellet to prevent clumping and cell death
  * Col1 is very viscous, pipette carefully - when adding 10x DMEM, it turns yellow
  * As soon as you add the NaOH, be quick as the Col starts to gel
  * Everything has to be exact, don't be tempted to add more cells than the volume stated if there are some left
  * Add cells slowly!
