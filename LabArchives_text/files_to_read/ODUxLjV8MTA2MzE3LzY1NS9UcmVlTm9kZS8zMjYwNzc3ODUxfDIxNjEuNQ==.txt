Fridge 104 (library lab) Top shelf on the door.  
There is 120mL in the container, you'll only need 60mL, p38i is already added.  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  




Growth Media:

  * [x]  DMEM/F12 + 20% FBS + 1X P/S + P38i (10uM)

Total media required: 60mL

  




Process:

1\. Removed pre aliquoted    120mL  mL of Growth media in a 120mL container
from the fridge and placed in water bath   10:29

2\. Inspected each flask under the 5x objective on the primo microscope,
scanned the bar code of each flask and captured 2x images to monitor cell
confluence and morphology.

3\. Removed  50  % of supernatant from each vessel mentioned above.

4\. Replaced with  15 mL (per well/per vessel) of  growth   media.

5\. Returned vessel to incubate at:    11:10  

  * [x]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells), incubator 67.
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (aviary cells)
