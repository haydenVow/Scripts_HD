Culture ID(s)  
Vessel type  
No. of wells to fix (staining later)

Media/Reagents used:

NameDetails  
PFA  
5 (4 mL + excess) mL; Alq #3079  
  
dPBS40 mL (32 mL + excess);  Mix #7046  
  
  
40 wells in total

100 uL of PFA in each well = 4 mL

200 uL of dPBS x 4 (once to wash out growth media, twice to wash out the PFA
and once again to top up the fixed cells) = 32 mL

  




Process:

Fixing ( ~ 20 - 30 min)

  1.  Removed media from each well and wash with PBS @ 12:42 - 12:47 pm
  2.  Added  100 µL PFA for 15 min:  12:48 - 1:03 pm 
  3. Removed PFA (and add in PFA waste container) and wash wells with   200 µL PBS twice (refer to steps below)
  4. Parafilm the assay plate and place in fridge.

First PBS wash: 1:04 - 1:09 pm, wait 5 mins.

Second PBS wash: 1:10 - 1:15 pm, wait 5 mins.

Final addition of PBS @ 1:61 pm.




Observations/Summary:

###  

###  

All cells in rows C were void of cells due to cell death observed in wells
with 2% HS Diff media and 100% feeds. Note that all cells in row E and wells
F7-F10 appear to be differentiating, and did not observe the same cell death.
Will need further investigation.

i.e. all wells that had 100% feeds and were in 2% HS diff media died/detached
from the 96-well plate.

all wells that had 2% HS diff media added on Day 0 of differentiation and did
not undergo any additional feeds appear in tact and differentiating.

all wells that had 50% feeds and were in 2% HS diff media appear in tact and
differentiating.

  

This is unlike plate 8410-DOLLY12-Sheep P10- 2of4 (part of another experiment
running simultaneously), which observed cell death and detachment in all wells
in rows C and E (100% feeds and 50% feeds with 2% HS diff media).
