Aim/Purpose


1\. to investigate the suitability of Alginate hydrogels as a cell
encapsulation matrix for mechanical stimulation

2.  to identify the minimum cell density in alginate that results in differentiation/maturation


Hypothesis


By increasing the cell seeding density inside alginate gels, we can create
sufficient cell-cell contact to enable differentiation and enable the use of
alginate as a matrix


Technical Gap


In previous studies we never observed cell differentiation inside alginate,
probably due to insufficient cell seeding density. In this study we are hoping
to overcome this limitation and enable alginate as a viable candidate for cell
encapsulation.


Method/Procedure


## Study setup:

  1. Preliminary experiments to test suitability of alginate crosslinking in conical inserts
  2. Cell expansion of C2C12s to 100M
  3. Preparation of materials (4% alginate, autoclaved, and 100mM CaCl2, sterile-filtered)
  4. Day 0: Cell harvest and seeding into gel matrices in inserts vs controls (see platemap below)
  5. Day 1: 100% switch media to E6 and start differentation
  6. Day 2: assess viability using CMFDA or MTT assay for half of each sample sacrificed other half fix (and stain with Day6 samples) , 100% feed
  7. Day 3: 100% feed
  8. Day 4: 100% feed
  9. Day 5: 100% feed
  10. Day 6: assess maturity of muscle using immunostaining or total protein quant.




## Materials Prep

Preparation of 4% Alginate solution:

  * weigh out 8 g of alginic acid into a weigh boat
  * measure out 200 mL of ddH20 into a schott/duran bottle
  * label the bottle '4% alginate solution in ddH20
  * add magnetic stir bar to the bottle and place on magnetic stir plate
  * slowly add the 8g of alginic acid to the stirring ddH20
  * leave to stir until dissolved at 40C
  * add the bottle lid and screw on loosely, cover with autoclave tape
  * autoclave solution

Preparation of 100mM CaCl2:

  * In a 200 mL bottle add 2.22 g of CaCl2 granules into 200 mL of dH20 > stir until dissolved
  * sterile filter

Preliminary testing #1:

  1. pipet 150 uL of AlluraRed-dyed 4% alginate into a conical insert
  2. immerse in 1 mL of 100 mM CaCl2 in a 24wp
  3. examine shape/warping of alginate gel after crosslinking

\--> shape is mostly maintained, Alginate can be used as a Collagen-hydrogel
alternative

Preliminary testing #2:

  1. pipet alginate into a CaCl2 bath to precipitate beads/worms
  2. measure diameter = 3 mm (14 uL volume)
  3. beads are stable after only 2 min

\--> we can use this technique to encapsulate cells in "macrocarriers" for use
in maturation bioreactors




## Encapsulation of cells

  

  

  

  1. centrifuge ~100M cells and resuspend in growth media to a total max volume of XXX mL       time    
  2. Prepare cell suspensions in alginate at varying loading densities:

  4.  Prepare cell free alginate gel only: 
    1. 1 mL media + 1 mL of sterile autoclaved 4% Alginate in MQ 
    2. 1500 uL media + 500 uL sterile 4% Alginate in MQ  
  time  

  5. For conical inserts: pipette up to 200 ul per well around the perimeter trough of the insert  
For wells without inserts, add 300 ul to the center of the well  time  

  6.  Gelation will occur within 5 minutes, but allow approximately 10 minutes for firm gel formation.
  7. Transfer all inserts to a new plate preloaded with 1 mL media (wash 1) for 2 min
  8. Transfer all inserts to a new plate preloaded with 1mL media (wash 2) for 2 min
  9. Transfer all inserts to a new plate preloaded with 1 mL media
  10. Put plate in incubator
