Aim


To isolate a single cell population of muscle stem cells (MuSCs) and/or
fibroblasts from lobster muscle extract.

Animal is rinsed in 70% ethanol and dried prior to biopsy

  1. Produce multiple 2-5 cm3 muscle extractions from tail of lobster and collect in collection tubes containing antibiotic lobster saline (ALS) + 1X P/S. Wash for 5-10 mins.
  2. Transfer two tubes into lab
  3. Remove the two extractions from tubes and place each on a separate 100mm petri dish containing some DMEM/F12 + 1X P/S.
  4. Extracts are minced into 0.1mm - 5mm explants in both petri dishes.

Explant protocol:

  1. Explants from one petri dish are split into 3 different gelatin coated 100mm dishes (and 3 non-coated) containing:

  * DMEM + 10% FBS + 1X P/S
  * M199 + 10% FBS + 1X P/S
  * L-15 + 10% FBS + 1X P/S 

These explant cultures are monitored for cell monolayer formation and topped
with the appropriate media every 2-3 days. Once monolayer is observed,
explants are removed from petri dishes and the remaining cell population is
passaged to a new set of petri dishes.

Enzymatic digestion protocol:

  1. Mascerated explants from the other petri dish are transferred to 3 x 50mL falcon tube containing 10-20ml of a 50/50 mix of collagenase (type II) and dispase in ALS. 
  2. Tubes are incubated with collagenase/dispase mix for 1 hours at RT. (kk:does this stage require agitation? - I know when we've used these enzyme in the past bipsy digestion, we typical shake it in the shaking waterbath. Also worthwhile having a read of our current biopsy protocol. Perhaps you can use parts of it when creating the actual lab book (:  https://au-mynotebook.labarchives.com/share/Templates/MzI3LjZ8MTE3MTM1LzI1Mi9UcmVlTm9kZS8zNzI1MDI2NjgzfDgzMS41OTk5OTk5OTk5OTk5)
  3. Suspended explants are passed through a 50-70uM cell strainers into a new falcon tubes.
  4. Cells in suspension are pelleted by centrifugation at 650g for 5 mins.
  5. Pellet is washed with 25mL wash media (DMEM/F12 + 1X P/S) and then centrifuged once again.
  6. Repeat wash and centrifuge.
  7. Supernatant is removed and cells in each respective tube are re-suspended with the appropriate media.w
  8. Cell suspensions are dispensed evenly (for 45 mins) in 3 x different gelatin coated 100mm dishes containing: 

  * DMEM + 10% FBS + 1X P/S
  * M199 + 10% FBS + 1X P/S
  * L-15 + 10% FBS + 1X P/S

This 45 min step is for the quickly adhering fibroblast population to anchor
to the non-coated surface.

The supernatant (ideally containing the MuSC population) is then transferred
to a set of gelatin coated petri dishes for MuSC isolation. All 6 cultures are
given 50% media changes every 2-3 days.
