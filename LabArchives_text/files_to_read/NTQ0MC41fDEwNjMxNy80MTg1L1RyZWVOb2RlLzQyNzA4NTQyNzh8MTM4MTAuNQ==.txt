2\. Aliquotted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then
placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath for a minimum of 20 minutes
prior to use:

  *  Growth media (for seeding):    30mL
  *  Time that aliquots were placed in the water bath to warm before use:  16:00

  




## Thaw and seed vial:

1\. Collected the cryovial from liquid nitrogen storage & place in foam
floater in water bath for 5 min  

Location where cryovial was collected from:

Vial details:  2  x  cryovials at   500,000  cells.

2.Ethanol sprayed & transferred the vial the the BSC

3\. Added 500ul of Growth media to each cryovial, resuspended the cell
suspension gently to reduce osmotic shock.

4\. Combined the cell suspensions from both vials into a 15mL tube and took
20uL aliquot to perform cell cound

5\. Collected the total 2mL of cell suspenntion & transferred into the pre-
warmed Growth Media.

6\. Using a p1000 micropipette, resuspend & distribute the cells evenly in the
30mL pre-warmed Growth Media

7\. Transfer cell suspension to 1x T175
