Process:

### Step 1: Fix samples

  1. Removed flask(s)/plate(s) `culture IDs # XXXX  `from the incubator. 
  2. Removed media and washed wells with  XXXX uL PBS.  
  3. Remove wash and wash once more with  XXXX uL PBS. 
  4. Remove dPBS and add  XXXX uL of 4% PFA and incubate at RT for 15 minutes. TIMESTAMP
  5. Remove the PFA and wash wells twice with  XXXX ul dPBS.  
  6. Remove dPBS and replaced with fresh XXXX uL of dPBS 
  7. Proceed to primary antibody or store the plates at 4 degrees parafilmed until ready for immunostaining.

Fridge location/ID: XXXX




### Step 2: Permeabilize and block

Permeabilise

1\. Removed PBS from each well.

2\. Added  XXXX µL PBST (0.2% Triton-X) to each well for 15 min:  TIMESTAMP

3\. Aspirated PBST for each well.

  

Block

1\. Added  XXXX µL of blocking buffer (3% BSA in PBST [0.1% Triton-X]) and
incubate for 45 minutes - 1hr at RT. (no more than 1 hour):   TIMESTAMP

2\. While incubating, prepare primary antibody solutions (see next steps)




### Step 3: Primary Stain

Prepare Antibody solution(s)

Use this spreadsheet to:

  * Determine the total amount of regent required for primary staining
  * Provide more information on antibody types

1\. Prepared     XXXX mL  PBST (0.2% Triton-X)

2\. Prepared    XXXX mL  blocking buffer: PBST (0.1% Triton-X + PBS) + 3%
bovine serum albumin (BSA). (Kept in the fridge until needed in blocking step)

3\. Prepared Primary Antibody Mix: :  XXXX µL   XXXXX   (1:XXXX  ) in  XXXX
mL Blocking Buffer and  XXXX µL   XXXX  (1:XXXX) in  XXXX  mL Blocking Buffer
and a combined mix of both antibodies in their respective dilutions for
fluorescent control (in 5mL blocking buffer).

Pipette-mixed antibody mix and stored refrigerated away from light until
needed. DO NOT VORTEX ANTIBODIES!!

  

Single/Simultaneous Primary Antibody staining

1\. Removed blocking buffer from each well

2\. Added    XXXX uL  of primary antibody solution.

2\. Incubated cells with primary antibody for 90min - 2hrs at RT, or 4ºC
overnight:   TIMESTAMP

3\. Parafilmed plates and stored at 4ºC in lab Fridge ID XXXX.

After this step, all further task should be performed in a dark room. The
vessel should also be wrapped foil when not used.




### Step 4: Secondary Stain

  1. Prepared Secondary Antibody mixes (pipette from the top/supernatant of antibody solution
    1. Pipette-mixed antibody mix and stored refrigerated away from light until needed.
  2. Removed sample vessels from fridge (if incubated in primary antibodies overnight).
  3. Washed 3 times for 5 min with PBS at RT.  TIMESTAMPs  
  4. Incubated the cells with secondary antibody mixture in the dark at RT for 1 hour.  TIMESTAMP
    1. NOTE: from this step onwards protect from the light by wrapping plates in foil and perform experiment in the dark

    2. Do not add any secondary in the TMB + HCL control 




### Step 5: Enzymatic Reaction (TMB conversion)

Please note critical steps highlighted in bold/underlined.

  1. Removed 2nd antibody solution.   TIMESTAMP  
  2. Washed in 200uL PBS ( Tween20 ) 5 times for 5 min at RT in the dark. (No Triton) 
    1.   

    2.   

    3.   

    4.   

    5.   3. Started peroxidase reaction by adding 100 uL of TMB substrate solution to respective wells (see Figure 1 for plate map) and incubating plate at RT for 15 mins. TIMESTAMP 
  4. Quenched reaction with an equal volume of 0.5 M HCl or 100 uL  STRICTLY after 15 minutes and observed cyan to yellow colour change.
  5. Pipette mixed and transferred 100 uL of the yellow supernatant to a non-treated 96 well plate.
    1. DO NOT USE A TREATED 96W PLATE!
  6. Spun down plate in centrifuge for 1 min at 1000 rpm to remove bubbles and droplets
  7. Placed plate in NanoStar plate reader and measured absorbance values at 450nm (ELISA 405 preset program)
