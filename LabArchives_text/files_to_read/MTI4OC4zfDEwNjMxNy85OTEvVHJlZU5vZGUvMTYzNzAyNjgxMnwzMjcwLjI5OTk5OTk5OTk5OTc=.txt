Growth Media:

  * [X]  DMEM/F12 + 20% FBS + 1X P/S + P38i (10uM)




### Process:

1\. Took image of vessel with microscope on phase setting.

2\. Gelatin coated     3     x     T175     vessel with sterile filtered 0.1%
gelatin solution and then incubated all coated flasks at 37˚C.

  1. Time when all vessels(s) placed into the incubator      14:07    a/pm 

3\. Aliquotted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then
placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath for a minimum of 20 minutes
prior to use:

  1. TrypLE:     30    mL in     1 x 50 mL Centrifuge    tubes
  2.  dPBS (for washing and neutralising):     30    mL in   1 x 50mL Centrifuge     tubes
  3. Growth media (for pellet resuspension):     5    mL in     120mL Urine Container    tubes
  4. Growth media (for seeding):     90    mL in     120mL Urine Container    tubes

Time that all aliquots were placed in the water bath the warm before use
14:28

Note: if aliquots were placed in water bath at different time, record the time
stamp for each individual solution.




4\. Removed vessel(s) from the incubator    14:50   a/pm

5\. Washed the vessel(s) with 10mL dPBS (warmed).

6\. Added     10    mL tryple to each vessel/well and incubated at 37˚C.

Flasks were checked at [15:10] and only 50% detachment was observed .

Flasks were checked again at [15:17] and ~ 80% detachment was observed.

  1. Start/Finish for TrypLE was     14:59 - 15:24   a/pm 

7\. Neutralised with     10mL     dPBS and combined cell suspension into a
2 x 50mL    tube.

8\. Centrifuged at 650 x g for 5 min.

  1. Start/Finish time for centrifugation was     15:32 (Start Time) - 15:38  a/pm 




9\. Aspirated the supernatant(s).

10\. Resuspended pellet(s) in     3    mL    Growth Media      media

11\. Aliquoted      20uL    of resuspended cells into a microcentrifuge tube
for cell count.

12\. Performed a cell count using the haemocytometer and recorded the cell
count data in the Google Doc spreadsheet called 'Cell Count Spreadsheet' (see
link below):

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1DPzKubYxfHmWogVPihC-
SSIBtIylyrBQE5kRX5Z8NtI/edit#gid=0

  1.  Total cell number was:     ~ 1.2 million      

  2. Volume of cell suspension required for subculture was:      N/A       

  3. Cell density per vessel:      N/A      




Cells had been seeded at 1.1 million seeds 2 days prior and cells were
harvested today at 1.2 million cells total. Hence, due to obviously poor
growth rates - cells were discarded.

Observations/Summary:

Flasks were checked under the library lab Primo microscope to find that every
flask had achieved confluency. Images of 6722 (see below) were taken as
evidence of this. Hence it was decided instead of a scheduled feed, cultures
would receive a passage to 3 x T175 to calculate doublings (Nathan to do) and
monitor growth rate (to see if it has picked up).

Cell morphologies still appear to be irregular despite confluency being
acheived.

Cells took longer in Tryple to detach than the typical 10-15 min window - this
phenomenon was also observed with BUFFY6 clonal populations (potentially a
trait specific to clones of MuSCs)

NOTE: CELLS WERE DISCARDED DUE TO POOR GROWTH RATES OVER 2 DAYS.

### N/A




### Results:

  * Results were;
    * [ ]  As Usual (this is a repetitive task)
    * [X]  Unexpected because of irregular morphologies and POOR growth rates of DAISY clones
    * [ ]  Need to be further analysed
    * [ ]  Other (.......)
