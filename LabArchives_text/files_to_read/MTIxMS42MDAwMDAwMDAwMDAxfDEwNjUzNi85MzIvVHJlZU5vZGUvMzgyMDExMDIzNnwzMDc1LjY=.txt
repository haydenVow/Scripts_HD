Batch 29 Overview

[CHOMP09]

Batch Total Weight: N/A (Terminated early due to contamination)

Batch Objectives/Outline:

  * Harvest ~200g of cell mass to provide to Product 
  * Determine if seeding at 7,500cells/cm2 and 15,000cells/cm2 give the same yield in the final passage

  

Batch Timeline (Proliferation days in each passage & Flask no./type):

Passage NumberProliferation daysFlask No./Type  
P171x10CF, 1x4CF  
P267x10CF, 1x4CF  
P310 (terminated early)40x5CS, 2x10CS  
  
  

Notable Events:

  * This batch was originally planned for a final passage of 25x10CS, however due to a shortage of 10CS in the Vowse (only 2x10CS) available, 5CS were used instead. To make things more manageable the size of the batch was also reduced to 40x5CS and 2x10CS (equivalent of 22x10CS) 
  * Due to a widespread contamination throughout the laboratory (between 17th-30th January 2022: https://www.notion.so/vow/2022-01-31-Post-mortem-Fungal-contamination-28eabe30c9f04de48f1c9b12005f6703), flasks were observed carefully under 40x magnification to identify for possible contamination. Spindle-like structures were found in 2+ flasks, indicating potential fungal growth within the cultures. It was decided to discard the flasks due to the high risk of fungal contamination that was widespread throughout the labs and the questionable structures shown below.

Batch/Experiment Results:

  * No results could be determined from this batch due to the early termination.
