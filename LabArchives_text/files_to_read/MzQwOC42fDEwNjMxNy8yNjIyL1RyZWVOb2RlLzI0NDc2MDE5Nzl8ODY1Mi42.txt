Aim/Purpose


1\. To enrich the fibroblast portion of our KUZCO20 cells by expanding the
plastic adherent component of our raw isolate.

2\. To expand these cells to a master cell bank.  


Hypothesis


1\. Continuous culture of our plastic adherent KUZCO20 cells will allows us to
achieve 90% coverage of 700cm/2 prior to banking.

  


Technical Gap


1\. KUZCO20 is an alpaca biopsy recently isolated by Vow. As these cells have
yet to be expanded, we have no prior indication of the health and
proliferative capacity of these cells.

2\. As we are working with raw isolate, the plastic adherent cell population
is also likely to be a non-homogenous, mixed-cell population, and is unlikely
to be comprised solely of fibroblasts.

  


Method/Procedure


Experimental Plan  
  
1\. Thaw raw isolate of KUZCO20.  

  * Warm an aliquot of DMEM/F12 + 10% FBS + 1x PS (growth media). 
  * 1 x vial of frozen cell isolate from KUZCO20 will be thawed and plated into 1x 6 well plate. Non-coated plates will be used to aid preferential selection of fibroblasts. Incubate at 37 degrees C and 5% CO2.
  * 4 hours after seeding, the seeding media containing unattached cells will be removed, and replaced with fresh growth media. 

2\. Monitor/ feed plastic adherent KUZCO20 cells

  * Perform daily imaging of the plate & write observations regarding cell proliferation and morphology.
  * Perform a 50% feed with  DMEM/F12 + 10% FBS + 1x PS approximately every 72 hours. 

3\. Expansion passages

  * When cells appear 80-90% confluent, passage following SOP_Passaging Adherent Cells V_04 using non-coated culture vessels.
  * Cells should be seeded back into plates at approximately 3500 cells/cm2.

4\. Passage and seed cells for immunostaining + Bank master cell bank of
plastic adherent KOZCO20 cells.

  * When cell numbers are sufficient to be 90% confluent across approximately 4x T175 flasks (700cm/2), bank cells as a MCB following Banking-Template_V2 .
