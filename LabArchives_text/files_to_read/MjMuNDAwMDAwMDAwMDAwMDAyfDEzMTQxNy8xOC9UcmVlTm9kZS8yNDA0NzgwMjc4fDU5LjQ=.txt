Varying ratios of Dolly 12 Fibroblasts to Cytodex 1 microcarriers


13/12/2021

Seeding Dolly 12 Sheep Fibroblasts onto Cytodex 1 (17044801) microcarriers:

  1. A constant microcarrier number (the manufacturer's recommended concentration) will be used in each of four Erlenmeyer flasks
  2. Seeding density of fibroblasts will be titrated

Our goal is seeding as few cells as possible for the greatest harvest in a
reasonable timeframe. We will start by decreasing the number of cells per
flask, using the manufacturer's recommended seeding density (3 g/L) a starting
guide. 1 x 107 cells per 0.3 g microcarriers are recommended (i.e. 2,500,000
cells and 0.075 g beads in each E125 flask containing 25 mL volume). We will
create a cell dilution curve across four flasks, starting at 5 million cells
per flask (double the recommended concentration) and titrating down to 0.625
million cells.

4 x E125 flasks, each containing 25 mL volume, were prepared such that each
flask will contain ~75 mg microcarriers.

Preparing Cytodex 1 microcarriers:

  1. 0.35 g microcarriers weighed out (aiming for 0.3 g microcarriers)
  2. Soak microcarriers in (Ca2+ and Mg2+ free) DPBS for 2 hours
  3. Remove old DPBS and rinse microcarriers in fresh DPBS
  4. Allow microcarriers to settle, remove supernatant, and made up to 20 mL in complete DMEM/F12 media

Preparing Dolly 12 Dolly 12 Sheep Fibroblasts for seeding:

  1. Each flask rinsed with 5 mL DPBS
  2. 5 mL TrypLE added to each flask
  3. Cells incubated at 37°C for 10 minutes
  4. TrypLE inactivated via dilution with 5 mL DPBS
  5. Cells collected in 4 x 50 mL tubes and spun at setting 6 for 10 minutes
  6. Cell count: 24.25*10*104  = 4,225,000 cells/mL ∴ 500,000 cells per 118.3 μL.
  7. Each of the 4 E125 flasks set up as follows in the below table:

Volume of Cytodex 1 microcarrier stock5 mL5 mL5 mL5 mL

The remaining cells were seeded in 17 x T75 flasks, at a density of 500,000
cells per flask (~7,000 cell/cm2).

13/12/2021 lab maintenance:

  1. Thawed out 50 mL frozen FBS in fridge
  2. Made up 500 mL fresh media
  3. Shaker installed in incubator

15/12/2021

One T75 flask split: 507,500 cells/mL split into two flasks seeded at 500,000
cells per flasks.

The cells in the remaining flasks were given a 50% fed.

Observations and suggestions from today:

  1. Tried to count cells on microcarriers using single-use haemocytometers. However, the microcarriers were unable to enter the opening on the haemocytometer. A glass slide and cover slip need to be used when counting cells on the microcarriers.
  2. We also realised that we seeded the 0.625 million cells and 2.5 million cells into baffled flasks and the 1.25 million cells and the 5 million cells into non-baffled flasks. In future, we will keep the flask design consistent across single experiments. Our next experiments will all be performed in non-baffled flasks.
  3. Using trypan blue to visualise cells on microcarriers does not work as the microcarriers absorb the dye very strongly and look very dark under the light microscope.
  4. KEY OBSERVATION: 0.625 million cells per flask and 1.25 million cells per flask have a low number of cell per microcarrier; 2.5 million cells per flask and 5 million cells per flask have similarly higher numbers of cells per microcarrier (more cells in = more cells on). However, without a decent method with which to visualise cells (e.g. haematoxylin) we cannot determine the best seeding density. Brodie will bring haematoxylin from his lab tomorrow.

15/12/2021 lab maintenance:

  1. Made up 500 mL fresh media

16/12/2021

Adherent cells look healthy and ready for seeding on microcarriers tomorrow.

Counting cells on microcarriers:

  1. Most microcarriers in the flask seeded with 0.625 million cells were empty. The odd microcarrier had a single cell attached.  

  2. 1.25 million cells per flask had very few cells per microcarrier--many microcarriers were empty, and those microcarriers that did have cells had only about 1-4 each.
  3. 2.5 million cells per flask and 5 million cells per flask had significantly more cells per microcarrier. Between the three of us, we estimated 8 cells/microcarrier for the flask with 5 million cells, and 5-6 cells/microcarrier for the flask with 2.5 million cells.
  4. For the next experiment, all flasks will be seeded with 5 million cells and the density of microcarriers will be varied.

Observations and suggestions from today:

  1. A 1:1 ratio of haematoxylin and DMEM/F-12 react to form clumpy debris which can make accurate cell counts hard. The longer the mixture of dye and media is left, the larger the aggregates. Going forward we will be sure to count cells immediately after the media and dye have been mixed so as to minimise time for aggregates to form.

16/12/2021 lab maintenance:

  1. Haematoxylin filtered
  2. Weighed out 0.67 g Cytodex 1 microcarriers (to give approximately double the density of microcarriers per flasks as was used in the experiment set up on 13/12/2021)

17/12/2021

  1. To obtain at least 20 million cells, cells were collected from 12 flasks. Cells were incubated in TrypLE, spun down, resuspended in 10 mL media, and then counted using a 1 in 10 dilution in trypan blue (10 μL cells:90 μL dye).
  2. Cell count: 227/8 x 10 x 104 = 2.83 x 106 cells/mL; 28,375,000 cells total ∴ 5 x 106 cells per 1.76 mL.

Microcarriers soaked overnight from 16/12/2021 were rinsed in PBS and then
made up to 20 mL with DMEM/F12 media.

  1. 50% media change performed for all T75 flasks. I.e. 6 mL DMEM/F12 media removed and replaced with 6 mL fresh DMEM/F12 media.
  2. Cells in E125 flasks given 50 % fed. I.e. 12.5 mL media removed and replaced with 12.5 mL fresh DMEM/F-12.
  3. Cells imaged and returned to 37°C incubator.

CONCLUSION: The 1 x microcarrier density (~75 mg microcarrier per flask)
recommended by the Cytodex 1 manufacturers (3g/L) was the optimal microcarrier
density when seeded with 5 million cells.

Preparing Cytodex 1 microcarriers:

4 x density microcarriers left to soak in DPBS: 1.2  g microcarrier soaking in
120 mL PBS

Two tubes of 2 x density microcarriers left to soak in DPBS: 0.6  g
microcarrier soaking in 55 mL PBS each

  1. Soak microcarriers in (Ca2+ and Mg2+ free) DPBS for 2 hours
  2. Remove old DPBS and rinse microcarriers in fresh DPBS
  3. Allow microcarriers to settle, remove supernatant, and made up to 20 mL in complete DMEM/F12 media

Preparing Dolly 12 Dolly 12 Sheep Fibroblasts for seeding:

  1. 10 x T75 flasks rinsed with 5 mL DPBS
  2. 5 mL TrypLE added to each flask
  3. Cells incubated at 37°C for 10 minutes
  4. TrypLE inactivated via dilution with 5 mL DPBS
  5. Cells collected in 4 x 50 mL tubes and spun at setting 6 for 10 minutes
  6. Resuspend cells in 10 mL media
  7. Dilute cells 1 in 4 with trypan blue
  8. Cell count: 44.375*4*104  = 1,975,000 cells/mL ∴ ~ 20 million cells (2 million cells per flask).

The optimal conditions for obtaining the greatest number of cells on beads
after 5 days appears to be 1 x bead density, 5 million cells, 15 minute
attachment time. However, this semi-quantitative method for determining
cells/microcarrier is not precise enough to say for sure that the slight
difference we appear to have seen between the flask conditions is real or
representative. Many more bead samples would need to be counted to confirm
this is a real difference. For the moment, we are content to say that there is
no drastic difference between the flasks.

The microcarrier:cell ratio of 75 mg microcarriers:5 million cells may
translate to a higher number of beads and cells per volume media.

The optimal conditions for obtaining the greatest number of cells on beads
after 6 days appears to be 1 x bead density, 5 million cells, 15 minute
attachment time. However, this change in values from yesterday is unlikely to
be real a more likely a consequence of sampling difference. Indeed, semi-
quantification appears to indicate no real difference between the flask
conditions after 6 days.

CONCLUSION: The optimal microcarrier concentration when seeding 5 million
cells per flasks is 3g/L, as recommended by the manufacturer. This experiment
replicates the results obtained on 20/12/2021 from the experiment set up on
17/12/2021.
