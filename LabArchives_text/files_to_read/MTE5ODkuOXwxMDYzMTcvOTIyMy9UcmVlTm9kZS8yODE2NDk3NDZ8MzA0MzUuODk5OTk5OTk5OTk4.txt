CLONES

Clones on culture 12614 were passaged by hand.  
  
Briefly.

  1. Cultures were imaged using the Zaber imaging system under 5x objective. Whole well images were stitched together and inspected manually for a confluence estimate by eye. Wells that appeared to have >90% confluence were selected for continuous passaging (see well selections here https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1yQD_JrhzktpQd0vaCt2B5OskKgl9SipLLab3WZ9v7ZU/edit#gid=1517361241&range=209:218) 
  2. Media was aspirated from these wells
  3. Wells were washed with 100uL of dPBS 
  4. Wash was removed and cells were covered with 100uL of Tryple
  5. Cells were left to incubate for 10-12 minutes at 30 degrees, 5% CO2. 
  6. 20uL of tryple volume from each well was then transferred to a new well containing 200uL of growth media on a new 96 well plate.
  7. The new culture was returned to incubator 140 (culture 12766) 




Counting 6wp 80 rpm suspensions  
10uL of suspension cultures were taken for counting (mixed 1:1 with trypan
blue on a hemocytometer:

Split cultures 11491 and 11492 that were in 6 well plates shaking at 80rpm.
1.5mL of each culture was added to a fresh well on the plate and both wells
were topped up to 3mL with growth media (Dmem/F12_20% FBS + 1xP/S)
