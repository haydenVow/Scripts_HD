StepInspect physical gas line connections  
Operator nameVP  
Time-stamp10:46am  
Protocol

  1. check gas line connections to the hardware. The AMBR hardware supports 3 gas inputs in the following order from left-to-right:
    1. CO2
    2. Compressed air or N2
    3. O2
  2. Mammalian settings will always used compressed air and not N2. Ensure this is physically connected at the gas regulator
  3. Inspect the regulator switch. Ensure the handle is running parallel to the line (open) and not perpendicular to the line (closed)
  4. Inspect the pressure of the regulators. The regulators should be between 1-3 bar in pressure for proper functionality. Ensure all regulators are set to the same pressure

  
Deviations & notesAdjusted O2 at regulator after opening to bring pressure to
the same bar as air and CO2 (just below 2 bar)

StepSet process parameters and flow  
Operator nameVP  
Time-stamp10:48  
Protocol

  1. Open Vow_1 protocol in processes tab at the bottom of the screen
  2. Adjust parameters as necessary
    * set stirring speed for each vessel
      * Select the 'Process' tab -> 'Vow 1' -> locate the 'Conditioning and Calibration' tab -> select 'Stir speed on' step / phase -> click 'Edit' -> select the RPMs that are being tested

      * Under the 'Set point' enter desired RPMs

    * control loops turn on or off (antifoam, dissolved oxygen, pH (CO2 gassing), pH (base)
      1. Go to 'Process' -> 'Vow 1' -> 'Control loops' -> Edit 'pH lower' and 'pH upper'; from this menu, the CO2 gas flow rate can also be changed by editing the 'Maximum (mL / min)' - can be used to alter the rate at which the pH changes
      2. Delete anti-foam control loop (anti-foam will dose at entire vessel volume when feed added)
      3. Delete dO control loop (unless required for the run)
    * set reservoir details and pumps
      1. Select 'Process' -> 'Vow 1' -> 'Pumps A-E'
      2. Assign the role of 'Pump A' as the feed (consisting of 3:1 R:H + GFs + antifoam)
      3. Assign the role of 'Pump B' as the base (1M sodium bicarbonate)
      4. Ensure the remainder of the pumps are marked as 'Not used'
    * media batch volume and total vessel volume after inoculation
      1. Edit the volumes of the batch by selecting 'Vow 1' -> 'Volumes' -> 'Batch media' in the 'Components' table -> change the volume to 180 mL
    * feed and sampling schedules
      1. Select 'Process' and explore around the screen to locate the 'Steps on days within phase' table and change the sample volume to 2 mL (1 mL x 2; once to purge the line and another to take the sample)
      2. Delete any 'Calculated antifoam bolus' steps (as the AF was added to the feed media

Suggestions/notes:

  * you cannot adjust pH set-point at this time before pH has been calibrated with spot patch and offset calculation
  * once a phase has started or has been completed it cannot be edited. Instead, copy the phase and paste after the phase currently in progress
  * to re-run a phase (e.g. the temp didn't reach set point within the specified wait time) can re-attempt the phase by clicking on 'Failed bioreactors' -> then press 'Retry'. Can also manually copy and paste the phase into the workflow in process tab
  * For any step that takes too long, the wait time can be changed by going to 'Process' -> selecting the relevant step in the 'Conditioning and calibration' table (e.g. 'Check for pH drift') -> 'Edit' -> 'Timing' -> select 'Maximum wait time' (e.g. 2m, 5m) -> 'OK'

StepAuto-set up for pH  
Operator nameVP  
Time-stamp11:42am  
Protocol

  1. System will automatically proceed through a number of steps and checks. The first is turn stirring on and warm media to set point - this will take about 20-30 minutes
  2. Following stages including probe hydration checks and pH drift will follow automatically
  3. During this time, cell count flasks for inoculation and calculate inoculum volume (next step)

  
Deviations & notes

  * Edited process:
    * reduced wait time for pH read consistent and pH drift steps to 30 minutes
    * inserted steps for turning on air sparging and headspace sparging at 2mL/min
    * inserted prompts to set pH and sparging rates for each reactor after pH set up and offset input completed

StepSample for pH offset calculation  
Operator nameVP  
Time-stamp4:00pm  
Protocol

  1. Follow prompts to sample 2mL from bioreactor. If vessels are new, there is no need to purge the sample line. If vessels are old, draw 1mL and discard to purge the line, and draw 2mL and reserve in falcon tube
  2.  ~~If vessel is old and being re-used, program another step to feed 1mL per reactor after inoculation during routine bolus feed~~
  3. Measure pH offline using pH probe and record pH values
  4. Follow prompts to record offline pH values and program will automatically calculate the offset

  
  
Deviations & notes

  * offline pH measurements:
    * BR1: 8.22
    * BR2: 8.24
    * BR3: 8.24
    * BR4: 8.27
  * changed pH set points:
    * BR1: 7.0
    * BR2: 7.5
    * BR3: 7.0
    * BR4: 7.5
  * pH was out of range by a lot, pH did not come within range within 5 minutes (this was the wait time specified for this step)
  * re-ran step and edited to have wait time of 10 minutes, and changed 'pH control check' (bottom section of the table) "If fail to reach pH -> Leave pH control on'
  * need to re-set pH set points when this process is re-run (returns to 7.5 as set point for all vessels)
  * observation: when pH goes down (during CO2 sparging), DO goes down as well.
