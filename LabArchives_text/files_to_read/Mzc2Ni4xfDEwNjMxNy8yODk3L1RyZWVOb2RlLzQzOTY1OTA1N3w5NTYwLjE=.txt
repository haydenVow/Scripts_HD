Growth Media:

  * [x ]  DMEM/F12 + 10% FBS + 1X P/S 




### Process:

1\. Took 2x image of vessel with microscope on phase setting.  

3\. Aliquotted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then
placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath for a minimum of 20 minutes
prior to use: time

  1. TrypLE:    5     mL in       15mL  tube
  2.  dPBS (for washing and neutralising):    5    mL 
  3. dPBS (for neutralising):    5     mL
  4. Growth media (for pellet resuspension):   2   mL 
  5. Growth media (for seeding):  90  mL in  

Time that all aliquots were placed in the water bath the warm before use
12:00 time

Note: if aliquots were placed in water bath at different time, record the time
stamp for each individual solution.




4\. Removed vessel(s) from the incubator   14:55  time

5\. Washed the vessel(s) with dPBS (warmed).

6\. Added    5mL   mL tryple to each vessel/well and incubated at 37˚C.

  1. Start/Finish for TrypLE was   14:59 - 15:18 time \- at 15:09pm at least 50 % of cells were still attached   

7\. Neutralised with   5mL      dPBS and combined cell suspension.

8\. Centrifuged at 650 x g for 5 min.

  1. Start/Finish time for centrifugation was    15:21 - 15:26 time 




9\. Aspirated the supernatant(s).

10\. Resuspended pellet(s) in    1   mL       growth   media

11\. Aliquoted     1 x 20    of resuspended cells into a microcentrifuge tube
for cell count.  

12\. Performed a cell count using the haemocytometer and recorded the cell
count data in the Google Doc spreadsheet called 'Cell Count Spreadsheet' (see
link below):

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1DPzKubYxfHmWogVPihC-
SSIBtIylyrBQE5kRX5Z8NtI/edit#gid=0

count 1: 1,592,000

count 2: 1,500,000

  1. Total cell number was:     1,546,000      

  2. Volume of cell suspension required for subculture was:      all      

  3. Cell density per vessel:    6871 cells/cm2     

  




13\. Transferred      all (1mL)    of cell suspension to the pre-warmed
36 mL    Growth media:    time  

14\. Transferred cell suspension into the pre-gelatin coated     3 x T75
vessel.

15\. Left at RT in the BSC for 30 min to allow cells to settle     time 16:02
- 16:32  

16\. Transferred vessel(s) to incubate at: 16:32

  * [ x]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (avian cells)

Observations/Summary:  

\- tryple time was increased as cells were not detached at 10 minutes with
tryple




### Results:

  * Results were;
    * [ x]  As Usual (this is a repetitive task)
    * [ ]  Unexpected because...
    * [ ]  Need to be further analysed
    * [ ]  Other (.......)
