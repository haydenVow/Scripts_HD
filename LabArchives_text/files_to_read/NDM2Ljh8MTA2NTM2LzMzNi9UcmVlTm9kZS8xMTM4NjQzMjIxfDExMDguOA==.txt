Harvest & Weigh Collagen


## Instructions

1\. Remove flasks from the incubator and spray into the BSC.  
2\. Weigh an empty tube and record the weight.  
3\. Scrape the bottom of the flask using the same pressure used to scrape
cells during a harvest.  
4\. Collect any residue/scraped particles and collect this into the empty
tube.  
5\. Centrifuge @ 700rpm for 5 mins.  
6\. Discard Supernatant. Use a 1mL pipette to remove as much supernatant
residue as possible.  
5\. Record final weight of the tube.




There was a very very small pellet of collagen matrix at the bottom of the
centrifuged tube. (Visible to the eye, but not able to photograph clearly).
