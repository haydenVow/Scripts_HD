RELATED TO MILESTONE:  Milestone 2: To have completed the experimental work on
at least two DoE's with multiple inputs [from cells, media, biomaterials
and/or microcarriers).

AIM/PURPOSE: To determine the stability of gluten, konjac and beancurd
materials after various sterilisation methods and maintenance under cell
culture conditions (growth media, 37'C, 5% CO2)- to assess their feasibility
for use scaffolds.  
  
To assess initial cell adhesion to gluten, konjac and beancurd scaffolds
(after 24hours in proliferation medium)

HYPOTHESIS: The materials tested will remain stable and intact after
sterilisation and in cell culture conditions. The materials tested will
support cell adhesion.

RESULTS SUMMARY:  

1\. Gluten (dry autoclaved)  
2\. Wheat flour + gluten (dry autoclaved)  
3\. Wheat flour (dry autoclaved)  
4\. Dried beancurd sticks (dry autoclaved)  
5\. Dried beancurd sticks (wet autoclaved)  
6\. Dried beancurd knots (dry autoclaved)  
7\. Dried beancurd knots (wet autoclaved)  
8\. Fried beancurd sheets (dry autoclaved)  
9\. Fried beancurd sheets (wet autoclaved)  
10\. Konjac (dry autoclaved)  
  
Samples 1,2,3,4,6,7,8 and 10 survived sterilisation (remained intact), whereas
samples 5 and 9 lost all integrity.  
  
Dry autoclaving was more beneficial to the long-term structural integrity of
the conditions in the media. The sole condition that survived the wet
autoclave sample (7, the dried beancurd knots) was easily torn and difficult
to handle after 24hrs in media.  
  
After 24hr in cell culture conditions sample 8 (fried beancurd, dry
autoclaved) was extremely soft and had deposited oil into the media. Whereas,
sample 6 (dried beancurd knots, wet autoclaved) maintained their form after
24H, but became extremely after 3 days.  
  
The gluten (1), gluten + wheat flour (2), and wheat flour (3) samples all
maintained good integrity after 24hr in media. The wheat flour (3) was
slightly more resistant to squeezing  and more dense than 1 and 2.  
  
Both the dried beancurd sticks, dry autoclaved (4), the dried beancurd knots,
dry autoclaved (6) and Konjac (10) maintained their form in media after 24hr.  
  
  

CONCLUSIONS:

Dry autoclaving was more beneficial to the long-term structural integrity of
the conditions in the media.

Overall, the most promising samples for cell culture scaffolds based on their
stability after sterilisation and cell culture conditions were the dried
beancurd sticks (4) and dried beancurd knots (6) sterilised via a dry
autoclaved run. The gluten (1) and the gluten + wheat flour (2) scaffolds
sterilised by dry autoclave were also promising, but would need to be cut into
thinner sheets which may be difficult to achieve.

Low cell adhesion was seen on all material samples (<10%) regardless of
sterilisation method.

NEXT STEPS:

Improved handling and preparation of samples could improve cell adhesion to
the material samples. Subsequent experiments should therefore aim to optimise
material preparation with the intention of impoving cellular adhesion.
