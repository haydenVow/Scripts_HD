Growth Medium: DMEM + 10% FBS + 1xP/S + 1:100 anti-clumping agent




Process:

  1. Aliquoted:
    1.  26 mL  of  DMEM + 10% FBS + 1xP/S + 1:100 ACA  x 2   
Placed in water bath: 15:30  

  2. Paused shakers by pressing the "play" button on the controller on the side wall of the incubator
  3. Collected culture vessel from shaker, wiped with ethanol-sprayed cloth and brought into BSC
  4. Using a 5 mL serelogical pipette, gently pipette-mixed culture for 1 minute to break up cell clumps
  5. Pipetted suspension though 70 um cell strainer into 1 x 50 mL tube
  6. Centrifuged at 300 x g for 5 min. Timestamp: 15:43 - 15:48
  7. Aspirated supernatant, taking care to not disrupt or aspirate pellet 
  8. Re-suspended pellet in 500 uL growth media
  9. Took 2 x 10 uL aliquots from cell suspension
  10. Performed cell counts and recorded in cell-count spreadsheet: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1YuTvXJXQQMIMwRZGeqNjdi20WeURg5FpM-1TJ-zrb1c/edit#gid=1104649984
    * Count:
