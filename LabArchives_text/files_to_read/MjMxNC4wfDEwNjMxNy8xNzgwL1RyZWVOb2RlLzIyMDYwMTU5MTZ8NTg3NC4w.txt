## Feed performed by: Bec Screnci  




Process:

1\. Place the pre-aliquotted  10 mL  mL of each respective type of Growth
Media into the water bath   9:35 am

2\. Placed shake tubes in centrifuge and centrifuge at 650 x g for 5 min at
RT.   10:40 am

Aspirated supernatant from each pellet

Added 1mL of respective growth media to each tube and used a P1000 pipette to
break up cell clumps.

Remaining 9mL of each respective media was added afterwards and triturated
with 10mL serological pipette to break up cell clumps for each culture further
and resuspend cells evenly.

4\. Returned vessel to incubate at:   11:03 pm

  * [X ]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (aviary cells)

  

  * Incubator (#67 ), Lab [Library]




### Observations:

Serum lowe - cloudy supernatant, 1 medium circular clump floating around

Serum high - very cloudy supernatant, 1 large circular clump floating around

ROCKi - cloudy supernatant, 1 medium clump sinking at bottom of tube

ROCKi + ACA - cloudy supernatant, 1 small clump sinking at bottom of tube

Pluronic - cloudy supernatant, 1 medium circular clump floating around
