AIM/PURPOSE: To develop a workflow/tool allowing us to quantify the success of
our maturation studies

HYPOTHESIS: Bradford ( or other Total protein assays) are suitable indicators
for the progress of muscle maturation studies. Most relevant proteins involved
in the later stages of myogenesis are captured using Bradford

RESULTS SUMMARY: A working pipeline has been developed to analyse water
soluble protein in mammalian cells has been constructed. This includes a
clear, working methodology for:

  1. Cell lysis and protein extraction
  2. Plate format and reagent quantities (see scheme below for standardized plate format) to use for the Plate Reader analysis step
  3. Automated data analysis to read out protein content (ug) using a Python script

CONCLUSIONS: The Bradford Assay and associated pipeline steps described herein
are a suitable and efficient method to analyse soluble protein in our cell
cultures (scaffold free). Pronounced differences between myblasts (100ug) and
mature muscle (~700ug) were measured in multiple experiments, demonstrating
the robustness of the method, which could further be enhanced by automation.
This simple assay will also be available and useful for other groups at Vow,
specifically the product team.

NEXT STEPS:

  * Incorporate a cell counting module as part of the Bradford pipeline to normalize protein gains to cell numbers.
  * Run proteomics on cell lysate to examine composition of soluble proteins and insoluble proteins missed by this assay to ensure no relevant (protein) markers of maturation are omitted
  * compare to alternative total protein assays (BCA, Lowry etc) or protein analysis techniques to establish fidelity
  * automate Bradford assay where possible to further enhance accuracy
