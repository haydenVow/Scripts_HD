Prepared media & reagents


Volume medium required

  1. CHO-S medium: [1] x [384] x [50] + 10 mL buffer = 24 mL
  2. CHOMP suspension medium: [2] x [384] x [50] + 10 mL buffer = 48 mL
  3. Nuvonis suspension medium: [2] x [384] x [50] + 10 mL buffer = 48 mL

The following medium was prepared/sourced

  1. CHO-S Medium: HyCell CHO + 4 mM Glutamax
  2. CHOMP Suspension Medium: HyCell CHO + 20%KSR + 1:100ACA + 4mM Glutamax + 100ng/mL IGF-1-LR3 & FGF-B 
  3. Nuvonis Suspension Medium: Freestyle 293 + 1g/L YE + 20mg/L L-Ornithine monohydrochlorid + 20mg/L Putrescine dihydrochloride + 1:100 ACA + 1mg/mL IGF-1-LR3 & EGF

Prepared FACS buffer

  1. Prepared 20 mL of FACS buffer (PRF DMEM/F12 + 2% FBS).
    1. 400 uL FBS + 19.6 mL PRF DMEM/F12
  2. Sterile filter through a 0.2 µm filter.
  3. Store at 4ºC until needed

Pepared plates
  
  
  1. Added 50 uL/well of Growth Medium to plates using OT2 (protocol linked in Rich Text Entry below)  
  
Notes: Plates 1 & 2 are CHOMP medium, Plates 3 & 4 are Nuvonis medium, and 5
is CHO-S medium.  
  

  2. Parafilm plates before closing the lid (sterile-side down, facing wells, as demonstrated in image below) & then parafilm lids and plates together (same fashion as is done for fix and stained plates in fridge) for transport to SCC facility 

  




Note: Edited OT2 protocol - removed "blowout" step for dPBS filling to speed
up protocol. Reduced time from 8 min to 5.5 min per plate for dPBS.

  2. Once cell pellet was generated after neutralising:
    1. Re-suspended pellet in __ mL Growth Medium (can go up to 4 - 5 mL if necessary, just keep in mind Hoechst is 100 X so if cell suspension is 5 mL, add 50 uL of Hoechst in the next step, etc.)
    2. Placed the FACS tube cell suspension on ice


Prepared styrofoam box for transport


1 Box with:

  * Pre-filled (medium) multi-well plates, parafilmed
  * An ice pack
  * Hoechst (ddH20) - vial is located in large new fridge in library lab, top shelf of door in 70 mL urine container
  * Extra FACS Buffer
  * Tube containing cells
