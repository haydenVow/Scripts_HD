Perform thaw using below volumes:

  




Growth Media:

  * [x ]  DMEM/F12 + 20% FBS + 1X P/S + P38i (10uM)

  




Prepare materials for thaw and seed:

1\. Gelatin coated  6  x  T175  flasks/plates with sterile filtered 0.1%
gelatin solution and then incubated all coated flasks at 37ºC

  * Time when all flasks placed into the incubator   9:25   

2\. Aliquotted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then
placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath for a minimum of 20 minutes
prior to use:

  *  Growth media (for seeding):    180mL in  1  tub.   

  * Time that aliquot was placed in the water bath to warm before use:   10:30

  




## Thaw and seed vial:

  1. Collected the cryovial from Liquid Nitrogen storage & place in foam floater in water bath for 5 min  10:55 
  2. Location where cryovial was collected from: 

Vial details:  2   x  DOLLY12  cryovials at   540K  cells each for a total of
1.08M cells

Brew

Tower/Bucket # 1

Box/Cane # 1

Vial location: A8 + A9  

Vial ID(s): 2207 +2208  

` `

  1. `Ethanol sprayed & transferred the vial(s) to the BSC.`
  2. `Added 500 µL of Growth media (to generate a total volume of 1 mL in the cyrovial) to the cyrovial, reuspended the cell suspension gently to reduce osmotic shock. `
  3. `Collected the entire 1 mL of cell suspension and transfer into the prewarmed tube of growth media. `
  4. `Using a serological pipette, resuspend and distribute the cells evenly in the   mL of pre-warmed Growth media. `
  5. `Transfered   30 mL to each pre-coated   T175 flask/well, allow to rest in the BSC at RT for 30 minutes  11:05 ```
  6. `Transfered flask/plate(s) to incubate at: 11:30`

  * [X]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells) THERMO

  

Making labels

Note - You will need to increase the passage number by one. (i.e. if your
thawed vial ID has a passage number of 3, when you make a culture ID for you
vessel you will need change the passage number to 4 on Airtable.)
