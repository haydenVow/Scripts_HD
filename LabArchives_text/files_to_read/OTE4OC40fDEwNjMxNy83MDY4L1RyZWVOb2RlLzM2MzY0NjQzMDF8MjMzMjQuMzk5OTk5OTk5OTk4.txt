Harvest and Seed

  

       Process

  1. Removed vessel from incubator and took 100uL sample from cell suspension. Returned cells to incubator immediately after sampling and cell counted. Recorded counts as per table above.
  2. Calculated required media for seeding E250 vessel at density of 50 000 cells/mL in a total volume of 30mL (made up of old cell suspension and new media)
    * see seed calculator
    * cell suspension to seed into new flask is 4.2mL for final volume of 60mL
    * Required new media is therefore:
      * ~56mL
  3. Added required growth factors to media, calculated from Media Calculator
  4. Incubated media at          37   °C for    30   minutes
  5. Removed vessel from incubator and performed media change/ ~~passage~~ :
    * added required newly prepared media into vessel as above
    * added cell suspension as above
    * Returned vessel to shaking incubation at 37°C
    *
