Background

The Biostat A (cell culture version), 2 L stirred-tank bioreactor is a system
designed for the expansion of animal cells. Its key components are:

  * Control tower (including mass-flow controllers for dosing gas and peristaltic pumps for dosing liquids)
  * Reactor vessel (including pitched-blade impeller for low-shear, impeller motor, gas sparger, pH and dissolved oxygen probes, ports for addition and removal of liquids and gases)
  * Reagent bottles (typically for anti-foam, base, feed and a spare for feed 2 or waste)

It has some key advantages over uncontrolled suspension cell culture systems,
such as Erlenmeyer flasks:

  * Accurate control of and higher maximum gas transfer rates allows us to achieve higher cell concentrations
  * Accurate control of temperature and pH to enable the use of these stimuli to control cell behavior
  * Automated removal of spent growth medium and addition of fresh growth medium to eliminate manual handling

The Biostat A has been widely used for microbial culture and mammalian
suspension culture. However, there is very little evidence of use for
microcarrier culture. The purpose of this experiment is to develop a set of
standard procedures for operating microcarrier cultures in the bioreactor, and
to concurrently train others in the operation of the bioreactor. The training
manual (attached below) will form the basis for this user training and
demonstration experiment.
