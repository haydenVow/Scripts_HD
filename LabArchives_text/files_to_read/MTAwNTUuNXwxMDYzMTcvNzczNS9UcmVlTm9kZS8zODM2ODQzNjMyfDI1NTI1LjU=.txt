Process
  
  
  1. Transferred _ mL containing 3,000,000 cells from culture 11634-Nuvonis Quail Suspension341-P-11of12 to 1 x 50 mL tube (lab book with culture and cell counts)
  2. Centrifuged at 500 x g for 5 minutes
  3. Aspirated 100% of supernatant
  4. Re-suspended in 3 mL of sterile dPBS (need 10K cells in 10 uL, so need 1M cells/1 mL in seeding suspension)
  5. Using 1-100 uL multichannel pipette, added 10 uL of cell suspension to each well of DSD plates 
  6. Imaged plates on Zaber microscope (phase, 5X) and ran through ML model. Checked that wells received cells. 
  7. Moved plates to incubator at 37'C, 5%CO2 (incubator #119, main/library/production lab)
