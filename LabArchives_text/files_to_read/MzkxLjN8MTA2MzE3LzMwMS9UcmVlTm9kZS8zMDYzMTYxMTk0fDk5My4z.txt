Total p38i required:




Reagent preperation

1\. Aliquotted   750mL  mL of  Growth Media into 1x 600ml + 1 x 150ml Placed
in water bath  15:37




Cell factory Process

  1. Unscrew white cap and remove blue cap and place aside.
  2. Removed  150mL supernatant from each 2CF by carefully pouring into a waste container with 150mL marked.
  3. Replaced with  `150` mL (per flask) of  `growth`   media by carefully pouring media through the white cap opening (alternatively you may use a 50mL serological to add media.)
  4. Place caps back and equalize 2CF by placing it on its side (blue cap on the bottom and white cap on the top, see image below:)  
  

4\. Returned vessel to incubate at:

  * [x]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (aviary cells)

  

  * [x]  Thermo Incubator (ID #13)
  * [ ]  Top Sanyo Incubator (ID #25)
  * [ ]  Bottom Sanyo Incubator
  * [ ]  Top Binder Incubator
  * [ ]  Bottom Binder Incubator




Media/Reagents used:

### Observations/Summary:

When I took the 2CFs out of the incubator, they only had 150ml of media in
each vessel. The media was not discolored. After speaking with Kylie, we
decided to just replace the full amount, so there is still only 150ml of media
in each vessel.  




### Results

  * Results were;
    * [ ]  As Usual (this is a repetitive task)
    * [ x]  Unexpected because... Unexpected because vessels were found to only contain 150ml of media. 
    * [ ]  Need to be further analysed
    * [ ]  Other (.......)
