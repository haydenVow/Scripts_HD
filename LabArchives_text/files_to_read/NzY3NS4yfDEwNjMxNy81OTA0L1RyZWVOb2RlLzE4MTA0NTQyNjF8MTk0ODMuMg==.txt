Media/Reagents used:

  

NameDetails (reagent ID)  
Tryple A6097  
  
dPBS (for washing & neutralising) A8756  
  
Growth Media M8766  
  
  
  

  




Process:

1\. Imaged each plate on 10x and 10x magnification.

2\. Aliquotted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then
placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath for a minimum of 20 minutes
prior to use:

  1. TrypLE:     12  mL in    1   tubes
  2. dPBS (for washing and neutralising)   24    mL in     1  tubes
  3. Growth media (for seeding):   100    mL in    1    tub
  4. Times that all aliquots were placed in the water bath to warm before use   16:40

Note: if aliquots were placed in water bath at different times, record the
time stamp for each individual solution.




2\. Washed the flask(s) with dPBS.

3\. Added     2  mL tryple to each vessel/well and incubated at 37˚C for    24
min.

WALLE06: 16:58  
WALLE07: 17:19  
WALLE09: 18:00

4\. Neutralised with   2mL    dPBS (warmed) and combined cell suspension into
a   15mL    tube.

5\. Centrifuged at 650 x g for 5 min

WALLE06: 16:58  
WALLE07: 17:50  
WALLE09: 18:30  

  




6\. Aspirated the supernatant(s)

7\. Resuspended pellet(s) in      1  mL      growth  media (WALLE06 and
WALLE07).  
Resuspended pellet(s) in      0.5 mL      growth  media (WALLE09).

8\. Performed a cell count using the haemocytometer and recorded the cell
count data in widget or the Google Doc spreadsheet called 'Cell Count
Spreadsheet' (see link below):

SSIBtIylyrBQE5kRX5Z8NtI/edit#gid=0

  




9\. Total cell number was:

WALLE06: 160,000, seeded into 1x T25, 6400/cm  
WALLE07: 315,000, seeded into 2x T25, 6300/cm  
WALLE09: 45,000, seeded into 2x wells of a 12 well plate. 6400/cm  

11\. Volume of cell suspension required for subculture was: 5mL (WALLE06) 10mL
(WALLE07) 2mL (WALLE09)  

12\. Transfer  cell suspension to the pre-warmed Growth Media.

13\. Transfer cell suspension into flasks/plates.

WALLE06: seeded into 1x T25, 6400/cm  
WALLE07: seeded into 2x T25, 6300/cm  
WALLE09: seeded into 2x wells of 12 well plate, 6400/cm

14\. Transfer flask/plate(s) to incubate at:

WALLE06: 18:05  
WALLE07: 18:05  
WALLE09: 18:50

  * [ x]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (aviary cells)
