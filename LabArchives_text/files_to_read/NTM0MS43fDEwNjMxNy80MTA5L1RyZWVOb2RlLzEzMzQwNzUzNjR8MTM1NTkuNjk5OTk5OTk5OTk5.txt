## Start Electrical Stimulation

###  
Attention: Restarting stimulation

1\. Perform a Test Run

For detailed instructions on how to do this, refer to the StimJim Notion Page.  
  
This is to check and record the what voltages the cells are actually seeing,
using feedback function within the StimJim.  
The test run is set for a finite amount of time. Anywhere between 10 and 100
seconds is recommended.

  1. Ran the stimulation pulse   10:00   
Stimulated with parameters:  
  
S0,0,0,500000,10000000; 4500,3000,6000; -4500,-3000,6000  
  
Paste the above sequence into the Serial Monitor.  
  
  

  2. Paste the response from the StimJim in the Serial Monitor below. It should begin with 'Parameters for PulseTrain[0]'  
\----------------------------------  
Parameters for PulseTrain[0]  
  mode[ch0]: 0 (Voltage output)  
  mode[ch1]: 0 (Voltage output)  
  period:    500000 usec (0.500 sec, 2.000 Hz)  
  duration:  10000000 usec (10.000 sec)  
  
  stage    duration     output0   output1  
    0     6000 usec     4500mV     3000mV  
    1     6000 usec    -4500mV    -3000mV  
\----------------------------------  
  
  
  

  3. Executed with command T0. Paste the response displayed on the Serial Monitor below. It should begin with 'Started T train with parameters of PulseTrain 0'.  
  
Started T train with parameters of PulseTrain 0  
Train complete. Delivered 200 pulses.  
Current/Voltage by stage:  
           Ch0                Ch1    
Stage 0  2978mV,            3016mV,  
Stage 1 -2758mV,           -3022mV,  
  
NOTE: CH1 no connected properly due to dodgy connection. Need to fix.  
  
  

  4. Optional: Record the oscilloscope output here:

  
  

### 5\. Begin Continuous Stimulation

For detailed instructions on how to do this, refer to the StimJim Notion Page.

  1. Ran the stimulation pulse   14:32   
Altered the code to eliminate duration limit (so no feedback) and ran the
above stimulation parameters continuously. Executed with command T0.  
Once more, paste the complete response displayed on the Serial Monitor (as
recorded in the Test Run) below:  
  
Ready to go!  
  
  
\----------------------------------  
Parameters for PulseTrain[0]  
  mode[ch0]: 0 (Voltage output)  
  mode[ch1]: 0 (Voltage output)  
  period:    500000 usec (0.500 sec, 2.000 Hz)  
  duration:  10000000 usec (10.000 sec)  
  
  stage    duration     output0   output1  
    0     6000 usec     4500mV     3000mV  
    1     6000 usec    -4500mV    -3000mV  
\----------------------------------  
  
  
Started T train with parameters of PulseTrain 0  
  
  
  




## Remove the Stimulation Lead Wire

1\. Removed the hook test clips from the electrode connection pins on the
culture dish lid for Plate 2 (____)  
  
The test hook can be released from the pin by squeezing the spring loaded test
hook handle. It is best not to touch the metal electrode pins while doing
this. Hold the plastic culture dish lid for stability. If any wires become
dislodged and the operator is unsure about reattachment, contact experiment
owner for assistance   Jared - 0420881185




## Imaging

1\. Imaged PLATE 2, taking whole well images of every well using the zaber
time  

For information on how to use the zaber, refer to:
https://www.notion.so/vow/User-Guide-to-Zaber-imaging-
ad19527eee9e42ed9db96faa911d6536

Tips for imaging the 12WP are to use 8x8 imaging sites in the HSC site
generator, remembering to change the spacing rule to field of view with 60 um
spacing. Remember to build the MM List in the HSC site generator and confirm
the number of images expected (usually >700) in the Mult-D Acq.




Media Change

1\. Retrieved   24 mL  of  E6 Media from a 90 mL shared gains and chains
aliquot in   1x 120 mL  pot from the biomaterials fridge.  
  
2\. Aliquots placed in water bath  time  

3\. Removed  100% of supernatant from vessel.

4\. Replaced with  2mL (per well/per vessel) of   E6 diff media using a P1000.
The media level must be accurate during stimulation.

5\. Returned vessels to incubate and connected the test hooks back up to the
electrode pins on the culture dish lid FOR PLATE 2 (____) so that each set of
hooks connects to the corresponding wire colour and so that the black hooks
are aligned on the left side of each well and the red hooks on the right (see
wiring setup reference image below)
