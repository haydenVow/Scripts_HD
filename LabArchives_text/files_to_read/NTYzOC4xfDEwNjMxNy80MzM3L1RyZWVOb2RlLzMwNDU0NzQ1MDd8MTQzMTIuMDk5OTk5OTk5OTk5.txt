Performed by: Bonnie




Process

1\. Plates located in incubator #68 library lab. Please image each well on 10x
magnification

Notes

1) No obvious cell adhesion

2) Far fewer cells than were observed floating in media than were seen on
24/09. BT believed these cells to be red blood cells based on colour and
morpholgy.

  

  




Reagent preparation

1\. Aliquoted   24mL   of  Growth Media . Placed in water bath   15:47




Process

2\. Removed  50 % of supernatant from the seeded wells of the 6-well plates.
There are still no cells attached to vessel. For this reason, 50% media from
each well was transferred to a new well in the same plate. 16:15

3\. Replaced with   ~~~~3 mL of   growth  media.

4\. Returned vessel to incubate at: 16:20
