## STEPS FOR BSC2 (Enzymatic Digestion Protocol for Cartilage) Performed by:

  1. Transfer 1g of biopsy tissue into a falcon tube with 5mL of Wash with Shark wash media. and leave for 5 minutes
  2.  Transfer 1g of biopsy tissue into a falcon tube with 5mL of Wash with Shark wash media
  3. Transfer 3g of biopsy tissue into a falcon tube with 5mL of Wash with PBS.
  4. Transfer to a dry 100mm culture plate. 
  5.  5mL of DIGESTION media was added to the plate and mincing with 2x scapels was performed (no. 22 type blade) for 10 minutes minimum.  : a/pm`  
`

  6. Media was slowly (~5mL) added to the minced tissue to keep the tissue just hydrated. 
  7. The tissue was adequately minced into 1mm pieces. 

Initiate Serial Digestion Stage:

  1.  Transfer the minced tissue from the petri dishes into a 50ml falcon tube containing 30mL Digest Media (LDF basal media + Collagenase, at 10mL of digestion media per gram of tissue).
  2. Incubate for 3 hours, at 26°C with optional agitation in the water bath. : a/pm
  3. Add 10mL wash media to the biopsy tubes.
  4. Centrifuge tube at 500 x g for 5 min.
  5. Add 5mL of Wash media. 
  6. Centrifuge tube at 500 x g for 5 min. 
  7. Aspirate supernatant from the pellet.  
  

  8. Resuspend in 5mL of Digest Media 
  9. Transfer tissue to a 50mL tube and incubate with shaking for 20 hours.     : a/pm  xx/xx/2022   \-   :    a/pm  xx/xx/2022    
  

  10. If the muscle is well digested, triturate through a 10mL serological pipette.  
If there are still muscle chunks, using a 10ml syring and 20-gauge needle,
aspirate and eject the muscle suspension in and out of the syringe 10x.  
CRITICAL STEP: The needle may be clogged by small pieces of tendon or
undigested tissue during the first few attempts. If clogging occurs during
trituration, remove the clog from the tip of the needle. If clogging occurs
during ejection, pull the plunger up and down to move the clog out of
position. Eject towards the wall of the tube (as opposed to the bottom) to
avoid foaming.

  11. Fill tube to 50 ml with wash media. Gently invert a few times to mix.
  12. Centrifuge at 500 x g for 5 min.       : a/pm  
  13. Aspirate supernatant down to about 10 mL.
  14. Place a 50-μm Nylon cell strainer on a fresh 50 mL conical tube.
  15. Resuspend the pellet with a 10 mL pipette. Transfer to the cell strainer and allow to filter by gravity.
  16. Add 10 mL wash media to the original tube. Swirl to rinse, and transfer to the same cell strainer.
  17. Rinse the cell strainer with another 10 mL WM. Use a 20-200 μl pipet to collect any remaining liquid on the underside of the strainer.
  18. Divide the ~30ml cell suspension equally across into 3 x 15mL tubes
  19. Add 10mL of wash media to each of the 3x 50mL falcon tubes. 
  20. Centrifuge all 3x falcon tubes at 500 x g for 5 min.  : a/pm 
  21. Remove all supernatant by aspiration immediately after centrifugation as the pellet will loosen over time! Be very careful not to aspirate cells from the pellet. 

Seeding Stage:

  1. Resuspend the cell suspension in each tube with 4.5mL of respective media (each tube will either be growth medium 1, 2, or 3).
  2. Seed the cells into their respective plating conditions. 
    1. For GM 1 falcon tube of cell suspension, seed 1.5mL of cells (per well) into 3 wells (1x un-coated, 1x collagen coated, 1x gelatin coated)
    2. For GM 2 falcon tube of cell suspension, seed 1.5mL of cells (per well) into 3 wells (1x un-coated, 1x collagen coated, 1x gelatin coated) 
    3. For GM 3 falcon tube of cell suspension, seed 1.5mL of cells (per well) into 3 wells (1x un-coated, 1x collagen coated, 1x gelatin coated) 
  3. Place in incubator at 26°C, 5% CO2 for 3-6 hours (parafilmed around the edges)     :  a/pm 
  4. After 3-6 hours, add 1.5mL of growth medium
