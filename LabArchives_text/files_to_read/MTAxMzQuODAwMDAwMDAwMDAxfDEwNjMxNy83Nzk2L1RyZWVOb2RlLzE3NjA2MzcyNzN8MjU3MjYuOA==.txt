Prepare materials for thaw and seed:

1\. Gelatin coated 2   x  4CF  flasks with sterile filtered 0.1% gelatin
solution and then incubated all coated flasks at 37ºC

  * Time when all flasks placed into the incubator 16:00

2\. Aliquotted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then
placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath for a minimum of 20 minutes
prior to use:

  *  Growth media (for seeding):     1200mL growth media +      600 uL p38i 
  * Time that aliquot was placed in the water bath to warm before use:  16 :30 pm 

  




## Thaw and seed vial:

  1. Collected the cryovial from Liquid Nitrogen storage & place in foam floater in water bath for 5 min  : - : a/pm 
  2. Location where cryovial was collected from:

` `

  1. `Ethanol sprayed & transferred the vial(s) to the BSC.`
  2. `Added 500 µL of Growth media (to generate a total volume of 1 mL in the cyrovial) to the cyrovial, reuspended the cell suspension gently to reduce osmotic shock. `
  3. `Collected the entire 1 mL of cell suspension and transfer into the prewarmed tube of growth media. `
  4. `Using a serological pipette, resuspend and distribute the cells evenly in the  600 mL of pre-warmed Growth media. `
  5. `Transfered   600 mL to each pre-coated   4CF flask/well, allow to rest in the BSC at RT for 30 minutes  17:30 - 18:00pm ```
  6. `Transfered flask/plate(s) to incubate at: `

  * [X]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells) - Incubator:           
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (aviary cells)

  

Making labels

Note - You will need to increase the passage number by one. (i.e. if your
thawed vial ID has a passage number of 3, when you make a culture ID for you
vessel you will need change the passage number to 4 on Airtable.)
