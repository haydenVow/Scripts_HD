  1. Determine the following key volumes and weights to make the desired number of scaffold pieces:
    1. Number of scaffold pieces desired: 96*2 = 192 scaffolds 
    2. Volume of zein solution used per scaffold piece: 50 uL per piece, ~ 5 mL sol'n per 96WP = 10 mL total (make excess so maybe 12mL)
    3. Total volume of zein solution (number of scaffold pieces x volume/piece) + loss/error: 5*2 + error = 12 mL total sol'n
    4. Total grams of zein required (total volume of zein solution / 5): 12/5 = 2.4 g zein powder
    5. Total volume of 80% ethanol to make (total volume of zein solution + loss/error to the filter): 12 + 2 = 14 mL 80% ethanol
  2. Acquire aliquot volumes of the Ultrapure water (sterile filter milliQ water using a 0.2 um filter into a sterile tube in the BSC) and of 100% ethanol ?mL of Ultrapure water needed
  3. Weigh out 2.4 g of zein powder into a sterile sample pot and record the actual weight below:
    1. Actual zein weight:  2.42g
  4. Transfer the zein powder, 100% ethanol and Ultrapure water into the BSC in the Production lab
  5. Make 20 mL of 80% ethanol in the BSC and filter it using a 0.2 um filter
    1. Volume made: ~18.3 mL
  6. Add 12 mL of 80% ethanol into a sterile sample pot/container and add a sterile magnetic stirrer bar (previously spray with ethanol then autoclave in a autoclave bag) inside the BSC
  7. Commence mixing of the 80% ethanol on the stirrer (sprayed down and brought into the BSC) and slowly add the pre-weighed 2.4 g zein powder until it is all added
  8. Mix at room temperature until the powder has completely solubilised (20-60 minutes):
    1. Start time:  11:20
    2. Finish time:  12:40
  9. Add 200 uL of 0.2 um filtered ultrapure water to each well of a 96-well plates (use multichannel pipette) 
    1. Number of 96-well plates required: 2 plates 
    2. Total vol. filtered ultrapure water required = 38.4 mL + error = 42 mL 
  10. After solubilisation, carefully add 50 uL of the zein solution to the top surface of the ultrapure water in each well in the 96-well plate (drop by drop) so that a skin forms on the surface of the water (use multichannel) 
  11. Allow the zein to form in each plate inside the BSC with the lids completely removed for 60-90 minutes
    1. Start time (last plate): 12:54
    2. Finish time: (started removing first pieces) 14:00
  12. Using a sterile spatula and forceps, loosen the edges of each zein piece from the walls of the wells and transfer the zein pieces into a sterile sample pot/container/tissue culture dish with 20 mL of DMEM. Discard any damaged or cracked pieces
    1. Number of pieces discarded due to damage or dropping: 1
    2. Number of pieces available for use: 191
  13. Seal the container and store the scaffold pieces at 4'C in DMEM/F12 until needed (for a maximum of 7 days prior to use).

## Finish time: 16:30

# Deviations/Observations: Longer precipitation time for the Zein (2+ hours)
