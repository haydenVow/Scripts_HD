  3. Collected culture vessels from shaker, wiped with ethanol-sprayed cloth and brought into BSC
  4. Using a 10 mL serelogical pipette, gently pipette-mixed cultures for 1 minute to break up cell clumps
  5. Pipetted suspension though 70 um cell strainers into 2 x 50 mL tube
  6. Centrifuged at 300 x g for 5 min. Timestamp: 12:45 - 12:50
  7. Aspirated supernatant, taking care to not disrupt or aspirate pellet (can leave ~1 mL to be extra sure)
  8. Re-suspended pellet in 25 mL of fresh warmed growth media
