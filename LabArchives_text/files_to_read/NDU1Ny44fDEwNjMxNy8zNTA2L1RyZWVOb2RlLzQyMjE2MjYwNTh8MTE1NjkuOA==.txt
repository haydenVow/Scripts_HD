Growth Media:  DMEM/F12 + 10%FBS + 1x p/s




Media/Reagents used:

  

NameDetails (reagent ID)  
TrypleM5076

Process:

 1\. Aliquotted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and
then placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath for a minimum of 20 minutes
prior to use:

  1.  TrypLE:   80 mL in | 2 x 50 mL mL | tubes
  2.  dPBS (for neutralising and wash)   160  mL in 4 x 50 mL tubes  tubes 
  3.  Growth media (for pellet resuspension):  10 mL in 1x 15mL tubes
  4.  Time that all aliquots were placed in the water bath to warm before use:   13:32  
  5. Took representative images of 2 flasks 

Note: if aliquots were placed in water bath at different times, record the
time stamp for each individual solution.




2\. Washed the flask(s) with dPBS.

3\. Added | 10 mL | tryple to each vessel/well and incubated at 37ºC for  min

  1.  Timestamp:14:27 - 14:43  

4\. Neutralised with | 10 mL | dPBS (warmed) and combined cell suspension into
| tubes.

5\. Centrifuged at 650 x g for 5 min

  1.  Start/Finish time for centrifugation was:  14:57 - 15:02   




6\. Aspirated the supernatant(s).

7\. Resuspend pellet(s) in | 8 |mL | growth | medium

8\. Performed a cell count using the haemocytometer and recorded the cell
count data in the Google Doc spreadsheet called 'Cell Count Spreadsheet' (see
link below):

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1DPzKubYxfHmWogVPihC-
SSIBtIylyrBQE5kRX5Z8NtI/edit#gid=0

9\. Total cell number was: | 11.1 |

10\. Calculate the required volume cell suspension & freeze medium to generate
a concentration of ~1M cells/mL.




11\. Prepared   mL Freeze Medium: (FBS + 10% DMSO).  15:35

Stored at 4ºC until use to keep chilled.

12\. Centrifuged cells at 650 x g for 5 min. 15:32  \-  15:37

Whilst centrifuge is spinning, prepared & printed vial labels, labelled
cryovials. (Note that passage number will be the same as the culture you
harvest from. The passage number will increase by 1 during the revive of a
vial.)




13\. Aspirated supernatant carefully, taking care not to disturb the pellet.

14\. Resuspended the pellet in | 5.5 |mL freeze media (chilled, to reduce DMSO
toxicity).

15\. Aliquotted | 500 |µL into | 11 | x cryovials (already labelled).

16\. Tightened the lids & transfer the cryovials to a Mr. Frosty immediately
into the -80ºC freezer.  15:55pm

  * [ ]  Without foam
  * [ ]  1st Freeze
  * []  2nd Freeze
  * [ ]  3rd Freeze
  * [ ]  4th Freeze
  * [X]  5th Freeze

17\. Allow the cells to freeze for at least 18-24 hours before transferring to
Liquid Nitrogen storage.
