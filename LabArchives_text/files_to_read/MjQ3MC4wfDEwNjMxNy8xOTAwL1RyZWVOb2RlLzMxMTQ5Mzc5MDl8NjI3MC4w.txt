Process:

1\. Aliquotted   18mL  mL of  growth Media into   1x15mL    tube(s). Placed in
water bath   12:01 a/pm

2\. Removed  50  % of supernatant from vessel.

3\. Replaced with  6 / 2.5 mL (T75 / T25 respectively) of   growth  media.

4\. Returned vessel to incubate at:

  * [x]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (aviary cells)

  

  * Incubator (# 77), Lab [Library]




### Observations/Summary:

  

  1. Clones growing in both T flasks appear to be growing steadily, they will most likely be due for a passage (confluence >50%) either tomorrow or on Friday to T175 flasks (with cell count performed). 
  2. The T25 flask does not appear to be performing well, <10% confluence at time of feeding when inspected under the microscope.
