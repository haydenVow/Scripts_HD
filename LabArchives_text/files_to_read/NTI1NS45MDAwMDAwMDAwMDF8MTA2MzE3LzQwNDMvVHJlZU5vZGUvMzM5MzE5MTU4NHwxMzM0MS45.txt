E6 in a 120 mL container.  
HS in a 70 ml container.  
  
The E6 media will be shared across three different experiment. I suggest that
you feed the 96 wp (from the E6 vs HS experiement) first, using 4 tips on a
multi channel)

Process:

  1. Check cells under phase setting on the microscope. Check if cells are dead or not 
  2. Aliquotted  3.5 mL  mL of E6 and D/F + 2%HS media each. 
  3. Placed in water bath   09:27 am 
  4. Removed  100  % of supernatant from vessel. 
  5. Replaced column 6 with  140 ul (per well/per vessel) of  E6   media.
  6. Replaced column 7 with  140 ul (per well/per vessel) of  D/F + 2%HS   media. 
  7. TIP: Use four tips on multichannel to add media back into the wells. The yellow container can fit 4 tips. 
  8. Returned vessel to the respective incubate at: 10:39 am
