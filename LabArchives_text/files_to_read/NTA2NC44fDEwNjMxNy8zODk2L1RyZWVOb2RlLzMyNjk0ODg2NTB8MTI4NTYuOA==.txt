Aim/Purpose


To repeat electrical stimulation using charge balanced stimulation and
stainless steel electrodes as per EPIC21489 Test 2, but using C2C12 cells.


Hypothesis


Using C2C12 cells instead of primary DOLLY cells will aid in successful
stimulation and


Method/Procedure


## Test Conditions and Cell Requirements

Samples  
  
n=3 of cells exposed to stainless steel electrodes and electrical stimulation
(4 V/cm)  
n=3 of cells exposed to stainless steel electrodes and electrical stimulation
(2.6 V/cm)

n=3 of cells exposed to stainless steel electrodes (control 1)  
n=3 cells not exposed to electrodes or electrical stimulation (control 2)

= 6 stimulated samples

= 6 unstimulated conditions

This is programmed into the stimulator via the Serial Monitor of the Arduino
software with the following sequence:

S0,0,0,500000,10000000; 4500,3000,6000; -4500,-3000,6000

## Cell and Media Requirements

### Seeding

### Each well in the 12WP is recommended to be seeded with 60k - 80k cells,
which equates to 720k - 960k cells per plate.  
  
1M cells divided up evenly per plate is the recommended method for seeding out
these plates.

  

Media

Generally 48 mL of media is required per day to feed 2 x 12WP with 2 mL per
well of media.

The first three days of culture is generally anticipated to be done using
growth media, however the cells may reach confluence earlier and will thus
require switching to differentiation media earlier.

Since E6 has an expiry of one week, it is recommended to make up 7x50 mL (350
mL) of E6 in 50 mL aliquots when starting the differentiation stage of the
experiment. Black plastic 50 mL falcon tubes are useful for this.

Note - Please double check you have enough of all reagents before commencing
the experiment.  
Note -  Serum media will be used in this experiment (D/F + 20% FBS +1X P/S)
for cell expansion and seeding, seeing as we are already using animal
components (gelatin) and our harvests of ACF cells are typically much lower
than for serum.
