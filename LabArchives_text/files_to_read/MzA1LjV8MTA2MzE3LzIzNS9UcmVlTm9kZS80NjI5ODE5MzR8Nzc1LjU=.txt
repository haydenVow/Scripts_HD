Intermittent agitation to facilitate adhesion (SP: 3)

  1. Passaged cells following Passaging Template_V3.
  2. Transferred cell suspension containing  272k cells/wellin to the 3mL/well of equilibrated microcarrier suspension in 6 well plates. Add cells into 3 wells per condition.
    1. Note: removed 200uL/well from serum based media before adding cells to keep volumes consistent across all conditions. Volume of cell suspension added per well:  

      *  0.548mL/well for serum  

      *  0.301mL/well for E89C
      * 0.333 mL/well for E810C
      * 0.312 mL/well for E811B  
  3. Transferred vessel to incubate at: `16:23
    1. [x]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
    2. [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (aviary cells)
  4. Began the seeding schedule for 6 hours using the KASA app and smart plug, 2 minutes shaking, 28 minutes static. 
    1. The minimum required agitation speed for shaken cultures to maintain the microcarriers in suspension can be estimated using this calculator: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/18NrC_xaJ2I87B4x3vTE46Z-ZUS3EV0Gw-CnM0DcukL4/edit?usp=sharing
      * Shake speed used = 90rpm
    2. The seeding schedule may be reduced or extended by removing or adding 30 minute cycles as required. Generally, at least 3 but up to 12 hours are required to allow the maximum number of the inoculated cells to adhere.
    3. Started shaking at 16:23. The timer shaker was set to shake for 2 min, then stay static for 28 min. Then repeat. It was set to shake continuously from 10.23pm.
  5. At the conclusion of the seeding period the vessel was left to shake continuously overnight.
