Process
  
  
  1. Took 1 x 550 uL aliquot from each E1000 and performed counts on ViCell
  2. Recorded counts in media results spreadsheet: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1cnmEz5amKSGmA9u3BJ-Dn0w-I7zFobBr6pG-UWCYaXM/edit#gid=595130609
  3. Removed 130.208mL of cell suspension from 50/50 flask 12743 and 132.275mL of cell suspension from 50/50 flask 12744, containing a total of 200M cells to seed EPIC31429 (took half from one flask and half from another to ensure a mix of cells is selected) (lab book link)
  4. Topped up media in 50/50 flasks so seeding density is ~200-300K cells/mL. If needed, moved to 2 x E2000s (referred to table below for working volumes of each E-flask) 
    * Added IGF, EGF, glucose and L-glutamine to media according to calculator in E8 spreadsheet for 50/50 media. There are aliquots of the solutions stored in 50 mL tubes in fridge 117. If there is not enough left in the aliquots, check the fridge in production for 2 x 1L containers of glucose and L-glutamine. 
  5. Transferred total cell suspension from 75/25 flasks into 4 x 250 mL centrifuge tubes
  6. Centrifuged at 500 x g for 5 min 
  7. Aspirated 100% of supernatant 
  8. Re-suspended in in-house 75/25 media so seeding density is ~200-300K cells/mL 
    * Added IGF, EGF, glucose and L-glutamine to media according to calculator in E8 spreadsheet for 50/50 media. There are aliquots of the solutions stored in 50 mL tubes in fridge 117. If there is not enough left in the aliquots, check the fridge in production for 2 x 1L containers of glucose and L-glutamine.
  9. Returned flasks to incubator
