Process:

1\. Download original templates developed for adherent 1-well picking on the
Opentrons. Can be found on the Vow google drive. Three are required:

  1. 384>96
  2. 96>24
  3. 24>6

2\. Adapt all three protocols for suspension culture conditions. This involves
eliminating the dPBS wash, tryple incubation. Consequently as the cells are
grown suspended in the growth media each protocol will only contain an initial
mixing step followed by a transfer step in which the cell resuspension is
transferred into the new culture vessel.
