RELATED TO MILESTONE:   Generating at least 1 suspension-adapted fibroblast
cell line.

AIM/PURPOSE: To develop a reliable method for performing live and dead cell
counts on suspension cells.

HYPOTHESIS: Co-staining suspension cells with both Hoechst and PI will allow
us to determine our total cell, live and dead cell counts with less
subjectivity that trypan blue counts.
