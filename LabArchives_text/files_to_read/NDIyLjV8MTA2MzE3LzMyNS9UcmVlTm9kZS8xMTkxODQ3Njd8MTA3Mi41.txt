Scope: Image scaffolds for cell seeding on both sides of scaffolds - write
observations on cell coverage

Reagent Preparation:

Prepare 1ml per well for 24well plates, and 100ul per well for 96 well plates.
Use Hoechst at 20ul/mL.

This test was done in parallel with entry EPIC16060: Hoechst survival test
experiment D1 16/4/21 Hoechst and Dapi staining of Zein Scaffolds + culture
plates. Protocol written by BT.

Hoechst staining protocol.

  

This staining was to be done on the bench not sterile.  

  

  1. Prepared Hoechst stain by adding 12 ul of Hoechst to 600 ul of pbs.   
  

  2. Hoeschst/media mix was sterilised using a syringe filter. 
  3. N=4 seeded scaffolds and N=2 of cell free scaffolds were removed from 6419 into a 96WP.
  4. Covered these wells with 100ul hoechst/media mix and incubate cells at 37Â°C for 10 minutes, protected from light.  16:30-16:40  

  5. Removed hoechst/pbs mix. 
  6. Wash with 2x with 200ul PBS for 5 minutes.   16:45-16:50, 16:55-17:00  

  7. Replaced PBS with fresh growth media for imaging. 
  8. Imaged using Zabre microscope. 17:30 - 18:00
