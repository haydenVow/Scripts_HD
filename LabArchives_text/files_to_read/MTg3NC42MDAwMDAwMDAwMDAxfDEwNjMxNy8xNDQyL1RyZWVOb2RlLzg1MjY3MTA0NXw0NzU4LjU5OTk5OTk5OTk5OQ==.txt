Process:

1\. Collected 2x48 well plate from clear drawer at bottom of "Media+Gelatin"
fridge in main lab labelled "SUN FEED E6 2x48-well plates". Placed in
incubator for at least 20 minutes  10:10am  

2\. Retrieved culture plates from Thermo incubator (large glass incubator).
Using a gloved, well-ethanoled hand, carefully lifted out the inserts by the
edges

3\. Placed inserts with scaffolds into new 48 well plate with warmed E6
medium. Use lid from previous plate for new culture to avoid re-printing
culture ID label.

4\. Repeated with second plate.

5\. Re-parafilmed plates.
