AIM/PURPOSE:

To test whether proliferation of fibroblasts using media containing DMEM/F12
made in-house is similar to media containing commercial DMEM/F12.

HYPOTHESIS: Doubling time of fibroblasts in both media will be similar.

RESULTS SUMMARY:

The 3 media conditions tested were: commercial DMEM/F12 + 10% FBS, in-house
DMEM/F12 + 10% FBS (from early filtration), and in-house DMEM/F12 + 10% FBS
(from late filtration).

On day 3, cell counts from late filtration in-house DMEM/F12 media were lower
than early filtration in-house DMEM/F12 media. On day 6, cell counts from late
filtration in-house DMEM/F12 media were lower than commercial DMEM/F12 media.

Cells in all T25 flasks died after 14 days in culture due to an unknown cause.

CONCLUSIONS:

Using in-house DMEM/F12 from late filtration may result in a significantly
lower cell numbers than using commercial DMEM/F12.  However, this finding
needs to be confirmed by performing a proliferation assay with more time
points, especially day 1 data.

NEXT STEPS:

Repeat proliferation assay with more time points.

The impact of in-house DMEM/F12 on cell growth over a longer period needs to
be assessed again after the cause of cell death in T25 flasks is determined.

Create LabArchives lab books/widgets that will assist in easier record
keeping. This will ensure that all growth conditions will be recorded in a
standardised format, making it easier to compare cells, media reagents, and
incubators used across multiple experiments.
