1\. Prepared   9 mL  PBST (0.2% Triton-X)

2\. Prepared   9 mL  blocking buffer: PBST (0.1% Triton-X + PBS) + 3% bovine
serum albumin (BSA). (Kept in the fridge until needed in blocking step)

3\. Prepared Primary Antibody Mix: :  120 µL   Primary #1 MF-20 (DSHB)   (1:50
) +  5880 µL Blocking Buffer

Total volume required of primary antibody mix =  6 mL

Pipette-mixed antibody mix and stored refrigerated away from light until
needed.

Process:

Fixing ( ~ 20 - 30 min)

  1. Removed media from each well and wash with PBS. 
  2. Added  500 µL PFA for 15 min:  14:30 - 14:45 
  3. Removed PFA (and add in PFA waste container) and wash wells with   500 µL PBS. 

  

Permeabilise ( ~ 20 - 30 min)

1\. Removed PBS from each well.

2\. Added  500 µL PBST (0.2% Triton-X) to each well for 15 min:  14:54 - 13:09

3\. Aspirated PBST for each well.




Blocking ( ~ 1 hr)

1\. Added  500 µL of blocking buffer (3% BSA in PBST [0.1% Triton-X]) and
incubate for 45 minutes - 1hr at RT. (no more than 1 hour):  15:13 - 16:10




Single/Simultaneous Primary Antibody staining ( ~ 10 minutes or 2hr)

1\. Removed blocking buffer from each well.

2\. Incubated cells with primary antibody at 4ºC overnight:    16:15  

3\. Parafilmed plates and stored at 4ºC in tissue culture lab Fridge.

After this step, all further task should be performed in a dark room. The
vessel should also be wrapped foil when not used.
