Process:

  1. Placed previously aliquotted media in water bath   11:13     

  2. Imaged each well once on Primo.
  3. Removed  100% of supernatant from vessel. No need to change tips
  4. Replaced with  500uL  (per well/per vessel) of   E6  media. No need to change tips
  5. Returned vessel to incubate at:    11:28   

  * [X]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (aviary cells)

  

  * Incubator (#52  ), Lab [Main/Library/Production]




### Observations/Summary:\

imaged all wells in order A1-A8, B1-B8 with one image per well (see MIA).
Observed some dead cells but plenty of healthy myotubes. coverage varies
across well, some areas are less confluent
