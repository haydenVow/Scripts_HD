Growth medium (CHOMP): HyCell CHO + 20%FBS + 1xP/S

## Process

  1. Prepared 2 x cell suspensions 
    1. 1 x 100,000 cells per mL (2 mL / 200,000 cells) 
    2. 1 x 200 cells per mL (2 mL / 400 cells) 
  2. Perform serial dilution (1):
    1. Added 6 x 1 mL aliquots of warmed growth medium to 6 x sterile eppendorf tubes
    2. Took 1 x 1 mL aliquot from the 2 mL cell suspension (100,000 cells / mL) and added to 1 x 1 mL aliquot (2 mL, 50,000 cells / mL)
    3. Took 1 x 1 mL aliquot from the 1 mL (50,000 cells / mL) cell suspension and added to next 1 mL aliquot (2 mL, 25,000 cells / mL)
    4. Took 1 x 1 mL aliquot from the 1 mL (25,000 cells / mL) cell suspension and added to the final 1 mL aliquot (2 mL, 12,500 cells / mL)
    5. Took 1 x 1 mL aliquot from the 1 mL (12,500 cells / mL) cell suspension and added to the final 1 mL aliquot (2 mL, 6,250 cells / mL)
    6. Took 1 x 1 mL aliquot from the 1 mL (6,250 cells / mL) cell suspension and added to the final 1 mL aliquot (2 mL, 3,125 cells / mL)  
Realised after seeding that I had originally planned on seeding each well with
6,250 - 100,000 cells, rather than cells/mL. Given this mistake, I decided to
use the remaining cells to seed four wells with 50,000 cells each to have a
high limit to test on the plate reader. See updated plate map.
