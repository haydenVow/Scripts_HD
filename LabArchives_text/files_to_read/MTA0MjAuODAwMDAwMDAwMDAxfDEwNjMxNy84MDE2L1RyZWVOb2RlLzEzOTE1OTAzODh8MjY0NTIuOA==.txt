Process
  
  
  1. Took 2 x 50 uL samples from culture 
  2. Performed count using haemocytometer 
    1. Cell count (average): 43,680,000 (cells are doubling every 24H now so we are ready to seed into 50/50 medium)  

  3. Removed 1.3 mL from culture (1.6M cells - remaining cells being used to seed EPIC31350)
  4. Added to 1.3 mL to 20 mL warmed 50/50 medium in new E-125 
  5. Replaced E125 in incubator at 37'C, 5% CO2, 120 RPM
