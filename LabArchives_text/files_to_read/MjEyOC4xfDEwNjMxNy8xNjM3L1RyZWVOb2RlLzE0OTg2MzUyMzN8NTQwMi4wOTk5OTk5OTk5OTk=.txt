Process (Coating with PureCol EZ collagen gel):

Procedure conducted according to guidelines recommended by Advanced Biomatrix:
https://advancedbiomatrix.com/public/pdf/5005-DFU-PureCol-Solution-
Rev-09-N.pdf

1\. Aliquot 5 mL of Growth media into 4x 15 mL tubes

2\. Add 100 uL of PureCol EZ collagen solution (for final concentration of
0.05 mg/mL) into each one of the 15 mL tubes.

3\. Transfer each 5 mL solution into a separate petri dish and ensure the
growth surface is covered evenly by the collagen/growth media solution to coat
the surface.  

4\. Allow the solution to incubate at room temperature for 1-2 hours with the
petri dish left covered in the BSC.

  1. Start/Finish time for incubation was  08:50 - 10:50

5\. Aspirate any remaining material from both petri dishes.

6\. Rinse coated surface carefully with sterile medium or dPBS, and avoid
scratching the surface.  

7\. Coated surfaces are ready for use. Store at 2-8'C slightly damp.




Process (Pre-coating with gelatin):

1\. Gelatin coated   4   x     petri dishes (100 mm)   with sterile filtered
0.1% gelatin solution and then incubated all coated flasks at 37ËšC.

  1. Time when all vessels(s) placed into the incubator     11:25
