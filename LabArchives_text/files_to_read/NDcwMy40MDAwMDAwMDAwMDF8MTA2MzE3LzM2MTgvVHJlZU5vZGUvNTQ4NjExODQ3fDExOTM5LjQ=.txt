Process  

  1. Made up stain buffer containing:
    1. 1 mL filtered dPBS 
    2. 2 drops of Hoechst 
    3. 1 drop of Sytox green
  2. Added 100 uL of stain buffer to 100 uL of sample in wells of 96WP (50% dilution of sample)
    1. A1 - culture 7700
    2. B1 - culture 7694
  3. Incubated for 25 minutes 13:03 - 13:28
  4. Diluted the stained sample to 25% and 12.5% in filtered dPBS only
    1. Took 100 uL sample from 50% dilution and moved into 100 uL of dPBS (25% dilution of sample)
    2. Took 100 uL sample from 25% dilution and moved into 100 uL of dPBS (12.5% dilution of sample)
    3. Took 100 uL sample from 12.5% dilution and moved into empty well for imaging
  5. Centrifuged plate at 650 x g for 1 minute 13:30 - 13:35
  6. Imaged whole well of both samples under culture ID 7820 using main lab Zaber microscope on DAPI & 488 channels
    * Program shut down just after imaging due to error - unsure whether images were saved before error. So re-loaded plate but new error message received on trying to image, delaying re-imaging process. Stanley fixed issue and able to re-image at 14:04. Note: Original images did save, so there are duplicate photosets   
  
Plate setup was as follows:
