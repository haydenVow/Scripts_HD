Process:

  1. Placed 10ml aliquot of E6 in water bath 10:01 am
  2. Sprayed in disposable plastic multichannel reservoir (alternatively, there might be a few already in the pipette box for BSC2)
  3. Removed  100  % of supernatant from vessel (set multichannel to 200uL and aspirate from all columns). No need to change tips.
  4. Replaced with  100uL (Column 4), 120uL (Column 5), 140uL (Column 6), 160uL (Column 7), 180uL (Column 8), 200uL (Column 9) (per well/per vessel) of  E6   media. No need to change tips.
  5. Check cells under Primo microscope and record whether cells look healthy.
  6. Returned vessel to incubate at   11:30

### Observations/Summary:

100  % media changed on vessel(s)

  1. 9248

Cells in wells of all treatment groups looked similar - long "fibers" of 10s
or 100s of micrometers long evident in each well.
