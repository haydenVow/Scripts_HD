StepInspect physical gas line connections  
Operator nameAV  
Time-stamp12:51  
Protocol

  1. check gas line connections to the hardware. The AMBR hardware supports 3 gas inputs in the following order from left-to-right:
    1. CO2
    2. Compressed air or N2
    3. O2
  2. Mammalian settings will always used compressed air and not N2. Ensure this is physically connected at the gas regulator
  3. Inspect the regulator switch. Ensure the handle is running parallel to the line (open) and not perpendicular to the line (closed)
  4. Inspect the pressure of the regulators. The regulators should be between 1-3 bar in pressure for proper functionality. Ensure all regulators are set to the same pressure

  
Deviations & notesAll three gas lines are connected and the tubes were
inspected. Oxygen and CO2 at 1.5 bar, air guage is at 150 kPa.

StepSet process parameters and flow  
Operator nameAV  
Time-stamp13:34  
Protocol

  1. Open Vow_1 protocol in processes tab at the bottom of the screen
  2. Adjust parameters as necessary
    * set stirring speed for each vessel
      * Select the 'Process' tab -> 'Vow 1' -> locate the 'Conditioning and Calibration' tab -> select 'Stir speed on' step / phase -> click 'Edit' -> select the RPMs that are being tested

      * Under the 'Set point' enter desired RPMs

    * control loops turn on or off (antifoam, dissolved oxygen, pH (CO2 gassing), pH (base)
      1. Go to 'Process' -> 'Vow 1' -> 'Control loops' -> Edit 'pH lower' and 'pH upper'; from this menu, the CO2 gas flow rate can also be changed by editing the 'Maximum (mL / min)' - can be used to alter the rate at which the pH changes
      2. Delete anti-foam control loop (anti-foam will dose at entire vessel volume when feed added)
      3. Delete dO control loop (unless required for the run)
    * set reservoir details and pumps
      1. Select 'Process' -> 'Vow 1' -> 'Pumps A-E'
      2. Assign the role of 'Pump A' as the feed (consisting of 1:1 RPMI:CHO + GFs + antifoam)
      3. Assign the role of 'Pump B' as the base (1M sodium bicarbonate)
      4. Ensure the remainder of the pumps are marked as 'Not used'
    * media batch volume and total vessel volume after inoculation
      1. Edit the volumes of the batch by selecting 'Vow 1' -> 'Volumes' -> 'Batch media' in the 'Components' table -> change the volume to 180 mL
    * feed and sampling schedules
      1. Select 'Process' and explore around the screen to locate the 'Steps on days within phase' table (should be on the bottom right, off-screen) and change the sample volume to 2 mL (1 mL x 2; once to purge the line and another to take the sample)
      2. Delete any 'Calculated antifoam bolus' steps (as the AF was added to the feed media)

Suggestions/notes:

  * you cannot adjust pH set-point at this time before pH has been calibrated with spot patch and offset calculation
  * once a phase has started or has been completed it cannot be edited. Instead, copy the phase and paste after the phase currently in progress
  * to re-run a phase (e.g. the temp didn't reach set point within the specified wait time) can re-attempt the phase by clicking on 'Failed bioreactors' -> then press 'Retry'. Can also manually copy and paste the phase into the workflow in process tab
  * For any step that takes too long, the wait time can be changed by going to 'Process' -> selecting the relevant step in the 'Conditioning and calibration' table (e.g. 'Check for pH drift') -> 'Edit' -> 'Timing' -> select 'Maximum wait time' (e.g. 2m, 5m) -> 'OK'

  
Deviations & notes

  * Set the stirring speeds to 150, 270, 390 and 510 (corresponding to tip speeds in the range of 0.2 - 0.7 m/s)
  * Deleted the AF and DO loops; set the pH upper and lower dead bands to 0.1; set the max base flow rate to 10 mL/hr with the proportional term = 10 kP; set the max CO2 flow rate to 50 mL/min with the proportional term = 40 kP
  * Deleted Day 5 (on a Sat) and added 'Unload bioreactor' step at the end of Day 4

Protocol

  

  1. Go to 'Bioreactor 1' -> select 'Borrow' -> choose all bioreactors and press 'Disengage' (make sure to remove the headplate and pH probe)

  2. Fill Reservoirs A and B with feed media (+ GFs + antifoam) and base respectively inside a BSC

StepAuto-set up for pH  
Operator nameAV  
Time-stamp13:57-15:57  
Protocol

  1. System will automatically proceed through a number of steps and checks. The first is turn stirring on and warm media to set point - this will take about 20-30 minutes
  2. Following stages including probe hydration checks and pH drift will follow automatically
  3. During this time, cell count flasks for inoculation and calculate inoculum volume (next step)

  
Deviations & notes

  * Offline pH for all bioreactors was around 8.2; online pH was around 7.7
  * PID loop did not bring pH back to spec after 5 min and proceeded to throw an error (and subsequently turned off the feedback control) - the step was re-run after ensuring that the resulting failure of the step did not turn off the loop

StepCulture cell count and calculations for inoculum preparation  
Operator nameAV / VP  
Time-stamp10:00  
Protocol

  1. Remove flask from BSC and sample volume into 1.5mL tube
  2. Perform cell count using haemocytometer or automated cell counting system (specify in notes)
  3. Record culture ID and cell density below
  4. Calculate required cell number for desired cell density at inoculation, and required volume of cell supernatant to satisfy this

  
Culture ID  
  
Current flask density (cells/mL)1.345M  
Required AMBR vessel cell density200k  
Required total cell number per reactor40M cells (=desired cell density x total
AMBR volume)  
Required cell suspension for inoculum29.7 mL (=total number required cells /
current flask density per mL)  
Deviations & notesSince L-glutamine and glucose will have to be added to the
AMBR vessels, the cell suspension will have to be pelleted and resuspended in
a smaller volume of fresh media (14.6 mL instead of 20 mL)

StepSample for pH offset calculation  
Operator nameAV  
Time-stamp15:48  
Protocol

  1. Follow prompts to sample 2mL from bioreactor. If vessels are new, there is no need to purge the sample line. If vessels are old, draw 1mL and discard to purge the line, and draw 2mL and reserve in falcon tube
  2. If vessel is old and being re-used, program another step to feed 1mL per reactor after inoculation during routine bolus feed
  3. Measure pH offline using pH probe and record pH values
  4. Follow prompts to record offline pH values and program will automatically calculate the offset

Operator nameAV  
Time-stamp17:07  
Protocol

  2. If the volume exceeds 20mL, pellet the cells by centrifugation (300xg for 8 minutes). Reserve 20mL of supernatant and resuspend pellet in this. If volume is less than 20mL, make up to 20mL with the addition of newly prepared media to cell suspension
  3. 'Borrow bioreactors' from AMBR system and bring into BSC
  4. Add inoculum via the liquid handler port using serelogical pipette
  5. Seal bioreactor and return to AMBR, load and engage bioreactors
