An experimental report should be open for every Vowzer to access, read and
understand the following:

  * why we did a certain experiment
  * how we went about planning and executing it
  * what the outcomes were / lessons learned
  * what the next steps are moving forward

We break these up into 6 sections in a report that should be clearly distinct
and easy to follow. They are:

  1. Introduction
  2. Materials/Methods
  3. Results
  4. Discussion
  5. Conclusions
  6. Future directions/next steps

  


Introduction


  * What was the experiment trying to address?
  * An important metric here is the why. Why was this experiment commissioned in the first place, and what value did we expect to get out of it? How does it feed into the larger mission/direction at Vow?
  * Re-state the aims and whether they were successfully addressed (with success or not).
  * Make sure you cite any information you've gathered from external sources if applicable. Generate citation list at end of report if there are any.

Materials/Methods


  * What was the overall design of the experiment?
    * How long was it expected to take? How long did it actually take?
  * Lay out the step-by-step process (overview) of the experiment, feel free to use graphs/flow charts to explain this.
  * Add links to SOPs used within this experiment.
  * Mention any deviations from SOPs and why they were made.

Results


In this section, state results without your interpretations behind it. For
example: Here, aim for 'molecule x increased glucose uptake of myoblasts.',
rather than 'molecule x increased glucose uptake of myoblasts indicating that
glucose uptake is controlled by pathway y.' Leave your interpretations for the
Discussion section.

  * Describe the results of the experiment in general terms.
  * Add in any summary tables/images/figures of the results to back up your statements.
  * Caption each table/image/figure with relevant details (microscope magnifications, n values, p values [if applicable])
  * Results should be directly relevant to the aims of the experiment.

Discussion


Time to expand on your results. Use this section as an opportunity to explain
your interpretation of the above results (don't leave any table/image/figure
un-mentioned, if it's part of the results it should be mentioned in your
discussion.

  * Discuss the implications for these findings or the reason that things might have worked out this way. Move on to the next set of results and repeat the process.
  * Be critical, are there any competing factors that may have interfered with the experiment and influenced the results? If so, state them and explain their potential impact on the perceived results. This may tie into next steps (ways to improve the experimental design to mitigate those risks).
  * Imagine you are reading this report for the first time with no knowledge of the experiment but want to know the key results and what they mean.
  * Discuss any limitations that may have impacted your work - explain their potential impact on the results and how that affects your interpretation.

Conclusions


  * Sum up the results of the experiment as succinctly as possible, this can be a short paragraph or a single line. Copy this to your Header Summary Page for the experiment/writeup.
  * If the experiment was unsuccessful, don't feel you need to over-complicate the results. Explain why it was not successful and any key learnings.

Future Directions/Next Steps


  * Provide a short paragraph or some dot points on the work that is to follow on from this experiment, e.g. repeats, new conditions, troubleshooting etc.
