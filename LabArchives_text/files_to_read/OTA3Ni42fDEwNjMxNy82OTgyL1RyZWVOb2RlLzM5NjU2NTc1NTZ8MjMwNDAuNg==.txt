Sample preparation (must be done 30 mins prior to experiment):

Total Biotin detection antibody working solution needed:   50uL x  36 wells +
200uL = 2 mL

Total SABC working solution needed:   100uL x  36 wells + 200uL = 3.8 mL

  1. Obtain  20 uL of Biotin-detection antibody and dilute with 1980 uL of Antibody dilution buffer to form a 1:100 working solution.
  2. Prepare 38 uL of Biotin-detection antibody and dilute with 3,762 uL of Antibody dilution buffer to form a 1:100 working solution.
  3. Dilute  30 mL of concentrated wash buffer into 750mL of wash buffer by adding distilled or deionised water. Store excess at 4 degrees. Cool to room temperature before use.
  4. Reconstitute the Vit-B12 standard by adding 1mL of Standard/Sample dilution buffer to make the 50 ng/mL standard solution. Use within 2 hours after re-constituting.
  5. Allow solution to sit at room temperature for 10 minutes, then gently vortex to mix completely.  11:37 -11:47  

  6. Prepare 600uL of 25 ng/mL top standard by adding 300uL of the above stock solution in 300uL of standard/sample dilution buffer.
  7. Repeat this process for the remaining standard concentrations: 50, 25, 12.5, 6.25, 3.13, 1.56, 0.78, 0 ng/mL.

Assay protocol:

Note: Bring all reagents and samples to room temperature 30 minutes prior to
the assay. A standard curve must be run with each assay.

  1. Wash ELISA plate twice with 1X Wash Solution before adding standard, sample and control wells.
  2. Add 50uL of each standards or samples into appropriate wells. Immediately add 50uL of Biotin-labelled Antibody Working Solution into each well. Seal plate with provided plate sealer. Gently tap the plate to ensure thorough mixing. Incubate for 45 minutes at 37 degrees.  12:45 - 13:50  

  3. Discard the solution and wash 3 times with 1X Wash Solution. Wash by filling up each well with Wash Buffer (350uL). Let it soak for 1-2 minutes, then aspirate. After last wash, aspirate then clap plate on Rediwipe to completely remove last wash.
  4. Add 100uL of SABC working solution into each well, cover the plate and incubate for 30 min at 37 degrees.  14:00 - 14:32
  5. Discard the solution and wash 5 times as done in step 3.
  6. Add 90uL of TMB substrate into each well, cover the plate and incubate at 37 degrees in the dark for 15-30 mins. The shades of blue should be seen in the first 3-4 wells by the end of the incubation.  14:56 - 15:11
  7. Add 50uL of stop solution to each well. Read result at 450nm within 20 mins.

Observations/Summary:

All reagents were prepared for an ELISA with 5 samples, however it was found
that Chris had prepared another 10 samples to run in addition to this. Another
set of reagents were prepared in haste and the additional samples
unfortunately had been exposed to the secondary first rather than the Biotin
antibody. It was decided not to go ahead with the additional 10 samples as the
addition of the secondary may affect the results. These samples were kept back
in the -80 degrees for later testing.
