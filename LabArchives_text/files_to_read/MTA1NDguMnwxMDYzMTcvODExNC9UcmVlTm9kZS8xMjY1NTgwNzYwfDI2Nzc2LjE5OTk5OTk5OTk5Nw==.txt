Prepare Cells for nucleofection

Cells used for this experiment were taken from the following epic (EPIC30430),
see passage entry here [https://au-
mynotebook.labarchives.com/share/Vow%2520-%2520R&D/MTA1NDkuNXwxMDYzMTcvODExNS9UcmVlTm9kZS8yMDQ4Nzk3MTUzfDI2Nzc5LjU=,
Total number of cells taken for this experiment = 3.2 million cells  

  * 1x15mL tube containing 3.2 million cells (in 2.2mL of dPBS) was left at room temp while the reagents below were prepared. 

  

  




## *Ensure cell count is performed before determining how much of the
following reagents to make

  

Prepare guides/cas9/Cas9 electroporation enhancer

  1. Guides in TE buffer (44 uM) (stored at -20) were retrieved from the freezer, (reconstitute new guides in 45.45uL of TE buffer if required). 
  2. Made up Cas9 mix. *Below is a 1 x mix for 1 well, multiply by number of wells you intend to make minus control (4) x 1.1 to get total volume required for experiment.

4\. Incubated mix for 10-20 min, (tubes were left in the bench hood for 10
minutes to incubate from []

5\. While incubating, the Electroporation enhancer was prepared.

  1. Buffer was removed from -20 freezer and thawed using body temperature. 
  2. Mixes for each guide were made up to 10.8 uM solutions using 1 x TE buffer. *Below is a 1 x mix for 1 well, multiply by number of wells you intend to make x 1.1 to get total volume required for experiment.

Nucleofection

  1. 5x1.5mL sterile eppendorf tubes were set up inside the BSC and labelled 1-5. 4x10^5 cells in dPBS were transferred to each tube. Tubes were then labelled as per guide below.  
    1. Tube 1 - BMF + BCHL211 
    2. Tube 2 - RIPK+FASLG
    3. Tube 3 - TBK1
    4. Tube 4 - Control
  2. The cells were centrifuged at 400g for 5 mins at room temp (HINGE OUT IN CENTRIFUGE)
  3. The supernatant was removed from each tube. It is important to remove as much as possible. Use a 1 mL tip to remove most of the supernatant and then switch to a 200 uL pipette to remove a little more if necessary. Do not disturb the pellet.
  4. To each Eppendorf tube the following mix was prepared, R buffer added first, then enhancer, then RNP.

17.The nucleofection machine was set up and 6 well plates retrieved from
incubator

18.The neon tip was inserted into the mix from above and draw up cell mix

19\. The cells were electroporated with the the conditions below, dispensed
into separate single wells on the 6 well plate, tip was changed between each
nucleofection condition.

20\. Cells were placed back in the incubator #140 for 72 hours.

Remaining cell suspensions was discarded.
