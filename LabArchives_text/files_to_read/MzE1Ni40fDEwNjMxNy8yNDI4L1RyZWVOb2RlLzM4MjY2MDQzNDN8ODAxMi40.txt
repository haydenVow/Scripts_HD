RELATED TO MILESTONE:  Enhancing maturation based on 2x Myosin expression or
60% MyoG

AIM/PURPOSE: We are trying to explore non-chemical stimulation to drive cells
towards more mature muscle, especially in terms of protein expression.

HYPOTHESIS: By adding mechanical stimulation we will be able to simulate a
more muscle-like environment, activating cellular pathways that result in
higher protein expression.

RESULTS SUMMARY:

Figure 1: CMFDA stain of matrix-embedded DOLLY12 cells, demonstrating
viability and spreading of cells

Figure 2: a) Design of 3D printed conical inserts used for passive mechanical
stimulation, b) upwards muscle ring migration after >2d culture

Figure 3: Contractivity and muscle ring migration behaviour as function of
cone angle (left to right)  compared to non-cell laden controls (far right)

CONCLUSIONS:

  * Cells embbeded in gel matrices remain viable over the course of maturation (Figure 1)
  * Suitable matrices were identified that encourage cells to spread and possibly differentiate
  * Cell-laden gels exhibit significant contraction and shrinkage compared to cell-free controls. 
  * Anchor point inserts require a large gel volume seeded in the wells to avoid gel detachment from the pins during gel contraction
  * If paired with passive mechanical stimulation (using conical inserts), the contraction-induced shrinkage results in muscle gel ring migration towards lower strain areas. Lower cone angles result in faster upwards migration (Figure 2 & 3)

NEXT STEPS:

  * optimize insert architecture to allow for easier harvesting and scale up
  * combine with electrical stimulation in a similar insert type
  * repeat with other cell types
  * measure weight gain, gel dimensions and other maturation indicators
  * explore alternative ways to analyze muscle maturity (imaging is tricky due to thickness of samples)
