  1. Allow the microcarriers to settle for at least 2 minutes
  2. Gently tilt the flask to an angle of approximately 30 degrees from vertical
  3. Remove the cap and aspirate the supernatant using a serological pipet - keep the tip only 5-10 mm below the surface during this procedure
  4. Transfer half of the fresh, pre-warmed dPBS fro prewashing to the flask using a serological pipet - wash down the insides to wash any stuck microcarriers back into the bulk suspension, then replace the cap

  




## Second wash to remove serum:

  1. Allow the microcarriers to settle for at least 2 minutes
  2. Gently tilt the flask to an angle of approximately 30 degrees from vertical
  3. Remove the cap and aspirate the supernatant using a serological pipet - keep the tip only 5-10 mm below the surface during this procedure
  4. Transfer the remaining half of the fresh, pre-warmed dPBS for prewashing to the flask using a serological pipet - wash down the insides to wash any stuck microcarriers back into the bulk suspension, then replace the cap

  




## Add detachment agent:

  1. Allow the microcarriers to settle for at least 2 minutes
  2. Gently tilt the flask to an angle of approximately 30 degrees from vertical
  3. Remove the cap and aspirate the supernatant using a serological pipet - keep the tip only 5-10 mm below the surface during this procedure
  4. Transfer the fresh, pre-warmed Trypsin/EDTA solution to the flask using a serological pipet - wash down the insides to wash any stuck microcarriers back into the bulk suspension, then replace the cap

  




## Incubate flask:

  1. Stop the shaker
  2. Remove the flask from the BSC and transfer it back to the shaker
  3. Restart the shaker at the `speed required for detachment` \- see the table below.
  4. After `7-15 `minutes, stop the shaker
  5. Remove the flask from the shaker
  6. Restart the shaker
  7. Wipe down the flask with an ethanol-soaked wipe and place it in the BSC
  8. 14:59 -15:09

## Neutralize the detachment reagent:

  1. Add fresh, pre-warmed growth medium to the flask
  2. Mix the suspension vigorously
  3. Allow the microcarriers to settle for at least 2 minutes
  4. Gently tilt the flask to an angle of approximately 30 degrees from vertical
  5. Remove the cap and transfer the supernatant to centrifuge tubes using a serological pipet - keep the tip only 5-10 mm below the surface during this procedure

  




## First wash to recover additional cells:

  1. Transfer 30mL of P188 solution to the flask using a serological pipet - wash down the insides to wash any stuck microcarriers back into the bulk suspension
  2. Pipet-mix the suspension vigorously
  3. Allow the microcarriers to settle for at least 2 minutes
  4. Gently tilt the flask to an angle of approximately 30 degrees from vertical
  5. Remove the cap and transfer the supernatant to centrifuge tubes using aserological pipet - keep the tip only 5-10 mm below the surface during this procedure

  




## Second wash to recover additional cells:

  1. Transfer 30mL P188 solution to the flask using a serological pipet - wash down the insides to wash any stuck microcarriers back into the bulk suspension
  2. Pipet-mix the suspension vigorously
  3. Allow the microcarriers to settle for at least 2 minutes
  4. Gently tilt the flask to an angle of approximately 30 degrees from vertical
  5. Remove the cap and transfer the supernatant to centrifuge tubes using aserological pipet - keep the tip only 5-10 mm below the surface during this procedure

*Trypsinised supernatant was collected in seperate tubes to P188 wash and handled as two different cultures and counts from here on out to elucidate the effect of P188.

  




# Optional: sieve cell suspension to remove microcarriers

  1. Pass the cell suspension through a 40 - 100 um pore-size sieve to remove any errant microcarriers.




## Recover pellet, prepare suspension for counting and subculture:

  1. Centrifuge the tubes at 650 - 700 RCF for 5 minutes
  2. Aspirate supernatants
  3. Resuspend pellets in 1 mL of fresh, pre-warmed growth medium (P188 wash) and 3mL GM for Trypsinised pellets
  4. Combine the cell suspensions into 1x 50 mL centrifuge tube
  5. Wash out each tube with the remainder of the fresh, pre-warmed growth medium and combine with the cell suspension

  




## Performed cell count:

  1. Aliquoted     20uL cells + 80uL Trypan Blue     of resuspended cells into a microcentrifuge tube for cell count.
  2. Performed a cell count using the haemocytometer and recorded the cell count data in the Google Doc spreadsheet called 'Cell Count Spreadsheet' (see link below):

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1DPzKubYxfHmWogVPihC-
SSIBtIylyrBQE5kRX5Z8NtI/edit#gid=0

  1.  Total cell number was:       648000 (T) + 428000 (P)      

  2. Volume of cell suspension required for subculture was:      N/A       

  3. Cell density per vessel:     N/A

Observations/Summary:

\- Cells on microcarriers after harvest seem "smeared" or stressed probably
due to the enzymatic exposure

\- Despite smart app being programmed to start shaking at the beginning of
Trypsinisation, incubator was powered off when taking Flask out of incubator
suggesting shaking had never taken place - perhaps the cause of low cell
harvest
