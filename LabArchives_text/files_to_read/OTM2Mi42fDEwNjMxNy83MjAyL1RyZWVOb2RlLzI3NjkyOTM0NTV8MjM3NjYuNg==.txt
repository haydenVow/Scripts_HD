Process
  
  
  1. Took 2 x 50 uL aliquots from e-flask culture and performed 2 x cell counts. 
    * Average cell count was: 7,146,666
  2. Transferred 1.4 mL culture to 1 x 15 mL tube
  3. Centrifuged at 500 x g for 5 minutes
  4. Aspirated 100% of supernatant
  5. Re-suspended in 6 mL of sterile dPBS (want 10,000 cells per well, so need 50,000 cells per mL in enough volume to seed all wells)
  6. Set up OT2 deck with media-filled plates and cell suspension 
  7. Ran cell seeding protocol on OT2 
    1. Start time: not recorded
    2. Run time: not recorded
  8. Imaged plates on Zaber microscope (phase, 5X) and ran through ML model. Checked that wells received cells. 
  9. Moved plates to incubator at 37'C, 5%CO2 (incubator #119, main/library/production lab)


Observations


The following wells did not receive cells from OT2 (surface tension overcame
blowout step) and were seeded manually after Zaber imaging:

Plate 1: C11, D11

Plate 2: B3, C10, D9 note: D5 & D8 also did not receive cells but this was not
noticed when watching the zaber, so these wells were not seeded.

Plate 3: C2, B9, B6, B4, C4, C6, C9, D9, D6, D4, D2

Plate 4: D3

Other observations: Column 11 on plates 2 and 3 has a lot of cells. Plate 1 B4
looked low on cells.
