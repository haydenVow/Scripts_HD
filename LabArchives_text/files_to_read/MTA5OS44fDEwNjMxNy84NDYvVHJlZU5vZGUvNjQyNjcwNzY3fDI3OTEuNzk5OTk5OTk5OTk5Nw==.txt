Reagent prep

Aliquot:

1\. 13mL of 10C media with 260uL of Hoechst added.

2\. 4 mL of serum-media with 80uL of Hoechst added.

3\. 32mL of 10 C media (for replacement media)

4\. 128mL of serum-media (for replacement media)

Place all aliquots in water bath. Timestamp: 13:30

  

Process

1\. Pipetted 150 uL of 10C OR serum-media with Hoechst into a new 96-well
plate

2\. Using sterile tweezers in the BSC move all cell-laden samples to new 96WP
with Hoechst  

3\. After 10 minute incubation remove Hoechst media and add 50 uL of pre-
warmed respective replacement media (ACF or serum) to each well for imaging.
14:00-14:10  

4\. Image all samples on the Zaber.

5\. While zaber was running, pipetted 2 mL per well of growth media (either
ACF or serum) into 80 wells of 2 x 48-well plates. Placed into incubator.
Timestamp:

6\. When zaber finishes imaging, flip all samples in the BSC.  

7\. Image again on the Zaber. NOTE: IMAGES WERE LOST THOUGH MIA- WILL NEED TO
RE-IMAGE ON 19/5/21 ~~~~

8. (When zaber finished imaging, used sterile tweezers to transfer scaffolds to wells containing ACF or serum-media in pre-warmed 48WPs) NOTE: This stem was not performed as imaging will be repeated tomorrow. Instead, additional media added to wells + returned to incubator. 

9\. Additional 180ul media added to each well and returned plates to
incubator.  18.30

  

Growth Media: 4767 + 4928 P38i

Hoechst: 772  




EH - Had to search for images, hard without plate ID references or MIA links.  
  
Cell-free plate:

EH - Confusing because the zein samples are clearly seeded with cells, but
this plate format matches the ID and format of the cell-free plate.  


Due to the confusion we cut off and sterilised new pieces of zein and gelatin,
DAPI stained and imaged, to show true cell-free samples: https://au-
