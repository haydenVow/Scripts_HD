We noted the location the animal acquired was made.

Cronulla Wharf, deep seawater, past the headlands, Sydney Australia.  
To ensure the shark's cellular viability was maintained, the sharks were
immediately placed in an icebox filled with ice.n/aPerformed by Adem, Kylie,
and Jasper with the aid of fishermen on a charter boat.5:30am-1:00pm

The volunteer assisting with scribing and timeframe recording can be briefed
ahead of time (biopsy stand-up/ pre-biopsy meeting) to record these details if
the lab-related tasks are not completed before the animal/ tissue section has
arrived in the Vowse.

difficult for operator to cut bone. Two scapels must be used.

## STEPS FOR BSC2 (Enzymatic Digestion Protocol for Cartilage) Performed by:
VB

  1. Transfer biopsy tissue into a falcon tube with 5mL of Wash with Shark wash media. and leave for 5 minutes
  2.  Transfer biopsy tissue into a falcon tube with 5mL of Wash with Shark wash media
  3. Transfer biopsy tissue into a falcon tube with 5mL of Wash with Shark PBS.
  4. Transfer to a dry 100mm culture plate. 
  5.  5mL of DIGESTION media was added to the plate and mincing with 2x scapels was performed (no. 22 type blade) for 10 minutes minimum.
    1. `note next time add 1mL at a time to the plate until the the tissue is only soaked to avoid adding too much liquid and which makes it difficult to mince.   
`

  6. ~~Media was slowly (~5mL) added to the minced tissue to keep the tissue just hydrated.  ~~note, this step was not done as 5mL was more than sufficent to mince the tissue
  7. The tissue was adequately minced into 1mm pieces. 

Initiate ~~Serial  ~~Single long term (20hr) Digestion Stage:

  1. Calculate the volume of digestion media needed for the tissue mass used.  
  2. Transfer the minced tissue from the petri dishes into a 50ml falcon tube containing 5mL Digest Media (LDF basal media + Collagenase 8mg/mL, where we are using 10mL of digestion media per gram of tissue).
  3. Incubate for 20 hours, at 26°C with optional agitation in the water bath. 10:40am   

  4. Add 10mL wash media to the biopsy tubes.
  5. Centrifuge tube at 500 x g for 5 min. 16:40-45
  6. Aspirate 12mL of supernatant
  7. Add 10mL of Wash media. 
  8. Centrifuge tube at 500 x g for 5 min. 17:02
  9. Aspirate supernatant from the pellet, very gently to avoid disturbing pellet

Leave the reagents at room temp for a minimum of 30 minutes before use

taken out of fridge at 10: 30

  1. Resuspend in 10mL of Wash Media 
  2. I ~~f the tissue is well digested, triturate through a 10mL serological pipette.  
If there are still muscle chunks, using a 10ml syringe and 20-gauge needle,
aspirate and eject the muscle suspension in and out of the syringe 10x.  
CRITICAL STEP: The needle may be clogged by small pieces of tendon or
undigested tissue during the first few attempts. If clogging occurs during
trituration, remove the clog from the tip of the needle. If clogging occurs
during ejection, pull the plunger up and down to move the clog out of
position. Eject towards the wall of the tube (as opposed to the bottom) to
avoid foaming.~~

  3.  ~~Fill tube to 50 ml with wash media. Gently invert a few times to mix.~~
  4.  ~~Centrifuge at 500 x g for 5 min.    ~~ ~~   : a/pm  ~~
  5.  ~~Aspirate supernatant down to about 10 mL.~~
  6. Place a ~~50  ~~40-μm Nylon cell strainer on a fresh 50 mL conical tube.
  7.  ~~Resuspend the pellet with a 10 mL pipette.  ~~
  8. Transfer to the cell strainer and allow to filter by gravity.
  9. Add 10 mL wash media to the original tube. Swirl to rinse, and transfer to the same cell strainer.
  10. Rinse the cell strainer with another 10 mL WM. Use a 20-200 μl pipet to collect any remaining liquid on the underside of the strainer.
  11. Divide the ~30ml cell suspension equally across into 3 x 15mL tubes
  12. Centrifuge all 3x falcon tubes at 500 x g for 5 min.  17:30 
  13. Remove all supernatant by aspiration immediately after centrifugation as the pellet will loosen over time! Be very careful not to aspirate cells from the pellet. 

Seeding Stage:

  1. Resuspend the cell suspension in each tube with 3mL of respective media (each tube will either be growth medium 1, 2, or 3).
  2. Seed the cells into their respective plating conditions. 
    1. For GM 1 falcon tube of cell suspension, seed 3mL of cells (per well) into 3 wells (1x un-coated, 1x collagen coated, 1x gelatin coated)
    2. For GM 2 falcon tube of cell suspension, seed 3mL of cells (per well) into 3 wells (1x un-coated, 1x collagen coated, 1x gelatin coated) 
    3. For GM 3 falcon tube of cell suspension, seed 3mL of cells (per well) into 3 wells (1x un-coated, 1x collagen coated, 1x gelatin coated) 
  3. Place in incubator at 26°C, 5% CO2 for 3-18 hours (parafilmed around the edges)    17:45
  4.  ~~After 3-18 hours, add 1.5mL of growth medium~~
  5.  ~~Place in incubator at 26 °C, 5% CO2 (parafilmed around the edges)     17:  a/pm ~~
  6. Refeed the cultures every 3 days with 50% feeds.
