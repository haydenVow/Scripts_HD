2\.  Poured warmed media into a sterile trough inside the BSC

3\. Removed  100%  (230 uL) of supernatant from 2 x 96-well plates (used fresh
tips for cell-free samples - refer to plate map for black plate. Other plate
has CF samples outlined on lid).

  

4\. Replaced with  230 uL  per well of  E6  media.

  

5\. Returned vessel to incubate at: 17:12

  * [x]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (aviary cells)
