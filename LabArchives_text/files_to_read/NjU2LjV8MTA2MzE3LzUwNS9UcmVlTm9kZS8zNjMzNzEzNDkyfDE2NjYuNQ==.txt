11/05/2021 D1 Prolif move samples to new 96w plates, 100% feed with respective
growth media (ACF or serum)  

DAY 1 Stain and Imaging with Hoechst:

Pre-warm 10C and serum media in the water bath (37'C)

Using sterile tweezers in the BSC move all cell-laden ZEIN samples to new
replicate 96-well plates, containing 200 ul of the respective pre-warmed media
containing HOECHST.  

For the Zein/gluten and cell-free plate just remove media and add pre-warmed
Hoechst media to each well. 14:35 - 14:45  

After incubation remove Hoechst media and add 50ul of pre-warmed respective
media (ACF or serum) to each well for imaging. 16:15 - 16:25  

Image all samples on the Zaber.

 ~~Flip all samples in the BSC.~~  Unable to flip as the scaffolds have become
amorphous blobs without a defined "side"  

 ~~Image again on the Zaber.~~

NOTE- CELLS ARE BEING KEPT ON FOR CONTINUAL CULTURE SO KEEP SAMPLES STERILE
AND TRY TO REDUCE TIME OUT OF THE INCUBATOR  

After Imaging:  

Remove 100% of the media from each well and replace with 250ul of respective
pre-warmed media (ACF or serum) and return plates to the incubator (37'C,
5%CO2)  

  

Results

\- Zaber images were very over-exposed, which was not realised until Day 2

\- Scaffolds were re-imaged using the Axio fluorescent microscope on Day 2
(see link below for images)
