Original Plate (96-well plate) - (Note scaffolds in wells with Black outlines
would have been used for Fix & DAPI)

  

  

  

New Plate (24-well plate):

  

Day 1: Prolif Move seeded scaffolds to a new plate (24-well plate with
inserts) and 100% feed biomaterials/scaffolds with prolif media (same media
seeded in)

  

Process:

1\. Prepare Growth Media for 24-well plates

  1. 2mL/well Growth media (no L-ascorbic acid) in wells A1-A6 & C1-C6
  2. 2mL/well Growth media (50ug/mL L-ascorbic acid) in wells B1-B6 & D1-D6

2\. Transfer plate into incubator for at least 30 minutes to allow media to
warm up   15:35 - 16:05  

3\. Transfer the 24-well plate into the BSC and insert 24 auotclavable inserts
into each of the wells of the 24-well plate.

Ensure each insert is submerged and that lid can be placed comfortably onto
the 24-well plate.

4\. Transfer the remaining scaffolds across from the 96-well plate into the
24-well plate with the pre-inserted auotclavable inserts as per plate map
shown above.

Use sterile forceps for transfer, and change forceps between different
conditions to ensure cells are not moved between different samples.

5\. Return plate to incubate at 37ÂºC, 5% CO2.

Observations/Summary:

\- Some scaffolds were quite adhered to the 96-well plate surface and
therefore difficult to remove from the plate.

\- In some instances the zein adhered to the foceps that were used to transfer
them between plates and in the process of disloging the zein scaffolds a few
may have been overturned.
