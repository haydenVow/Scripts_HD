### Process:

1\. Took images of each vessel with microscope on phase setting (10X and 4X).

2\. Aliquoted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then
placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath for a minimum of 20 minutes
prior to use:

  1. TrypLE:   5  mL in   1 x 15 mL  tube
  2.  dPBS (for neutralising & washing):   10  mL
  3. Growth media (for pellet resuspension):  2 mL   

  4. Growth media (for seeding):    12  mL

Time that all aliquots were placed in the water bath the warm before use
15:17 - 15:22  

Note: if aliquots were placed in water bath at different time, record the time
stamp for each individual solution.




3\. Removed vessel(s) from the incubator   15:22  

4\. Washed the vessel(s) with  5 mL per flask dPBS (warmed).

5\. Added   5  mL tryple to each vessel/well and incubated at 37˚C.

  1. Start/Finish for TrypLE was     15:41 - 15:51  

6\. Neutralised with   5 mL    dPBS and moved the cell suspension into   1 x
50 mL  tubes.  

7\. Centrifuged at 300 x g for 5 min.

  1. Start time for centrifugation was     16:02-16:07     




8\. Aspirated the supernatant.

9\. Resuspended pellet in   2  mL   growth  medium  

10\. Aliquoted   10 uL  of resuspended cells into a microcentrifuge tube for
cell count.

11\. Performed a cell count using the haemocytometer and recorded the cell
count data in the Google Doc spreadsheet: Cell Count Spreadsheet or cell count
widget below

  1. Total cell number was:    

    * CHOMP09:   1560000 cells    

  2. Volume of cell suspension required for subculture was:    

    1. CHOMP09:  721 uL  
  3. Cell density per vessel:   7500 cells/cm2   
  4. Add cell counts to the doublings calculator to allow tracking over time: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1kiVXcsre8aDPtA9DjQ84WzN0dLb7jrzD9GehzExe7Ng/edit#gid=0  







12\. Transferred the cell suspension of the following volume into the pre-
warmed   12 mL growth medium:

  * CHOMP09 cell suspension volume:   721 uL 

13\. Transferred cell suspension into   1x T75  vessels.

14\. Transferred vessel(s) to incubate at:   17:55 , incubator #82 main lab  

  * [ ]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (avian cells)
  * [x]  30ºC, 5% CO2 (reptilian cells)




Observations/Summary:

Flask was close to fully confluent (on Fri) prior to the passage, with some
signs of peeling.
