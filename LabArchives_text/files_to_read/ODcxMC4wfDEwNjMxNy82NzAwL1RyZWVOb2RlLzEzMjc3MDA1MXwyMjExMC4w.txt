Process:  

  1. Place media in water bath >15min prior to use 10:10
  2. Collected E125s from shaker, wiped with ethanol-sprayed Rediwipe, and brought into BSC 10:25
  3. Using a 25 mL serological pipette, gently pipette-mixed culture for 1 minute to break up cell clumps
  4. Transfer suspension into 50 mL tubes. 
  5. Centrifuged 50 mL tubes at 300 x g for 5 mins 
  6. Aspirated  50% (10 mL) of supernatant, taking extra care to not disrupt or aspirate pellet.
  7. Topped up each 50 mL centrifuge tube with 15 mL of fresh pre-warmed media and resuspended cell pellet. 
  8. Gently pipette-mixed cultures, and transfer all cultures to E250 flask
  9. Took 100 uL sample loaded onto a 96 well plate according to the plate map. 
  10. Returned E250 to incubator 11:25

Staining

Prepared Hoechst stain (50 ug/mL) solution in amber/black centrifuge tube:  
\- 9500uL MilliQ  
\- 500uL Hoechst Trihydrochloride trihydrate (1mg/mL)  
\- Vortex for 5 seconds to mix. Solution can be stored at 4Â°C for up to 6
months

  1. Took 100 uL samples from each culture flask
  2. Added 20 uL of Hoechst stain directly to cells
  3. Added 80 uL of MilliQ directly to cells 
  4. Incubated for 30 minutes in the dark at room temperature  11:30-12:00pm
  5. Made 4x, 8x and dilutions of the sample in dPBS 
  6. Centrifuged plates at 300 g for 1 minute 
  7. Prepared plate map: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/13FwMJhqsI1K1PjPImx4oB390Ab9H0s-pGUfi-ae5l8Y/edit#gid=0
  8. Plate ID: 10544 Link: https://ranger.vow.tools/#/session/recrJlhivxGA9Xq7V/images
  9. Imaged on the Zaber, then sent for to Mia for cell count analysis. Results here: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1YuTvXJXQQMIMwRZGeqNjdi20WeURg5FpM-1TJ-zrb1c/edit#gid=2066571586
