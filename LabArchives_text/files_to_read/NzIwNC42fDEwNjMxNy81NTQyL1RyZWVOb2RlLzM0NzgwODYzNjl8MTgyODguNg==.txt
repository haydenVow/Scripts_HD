Background  
Recently, 2 lines of F_CHOMP (Salt Water Crocodile) cells were isolated and
expanded into MCBs followed by WCBs. The F_CHOMP09 was derived from a
collagenase +dispase tissue digestion method while F_CHOMP07 was derived from
trypsin digested tissue. See lab books here: https://au-

In this study we will seek to address the following questions.  
1\. Does DMEM/F12 based media containing 20% FBS support greater rates of
F_CHOMP proliferation than media containing 10% FBS?  
2\. Does F_CHOMP09 have an equal rate of proliferation to F_CHOMP7?  
3\. Do F_CHOMP cells have a slowed rate of proliferation as WCBs compared to
MCBs?  
4\. Can F_CHOMP cells grow in Vows inhouse ACF media formulation  
5\. Can F_CHOMP cells grow in a commercial ACF media (Fibrolife)
