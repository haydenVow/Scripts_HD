  * Adherent re-adapted - 3x T175 flasks seeded with 20k/cm2 in 20mL of 50:50 RPMI:Hycell GM cultured for 4 days (conditions #10-12)
  * Adherent re-adapted - 3x T175 flasks seeded with 20k/cm2 in 20mL of DMEM/F12 + ITS + 18.8mg/ml BSA + P/S cultured for 24 hours (conditions #13-15)
  * Adherent re-adapted - 3x T175 flasks seeded with 20k/cm2 in 20mL of DMEM/F12 + ITS + 18.8mg/ml BSA + P/S cultured for 4 days (conditions #16-18)
  * Adherent re-adapted - 3x T175 flasks seeded with 20k/cm2 in 20mL of DMEM/F12 + FBS + P/S cultured for 24 hours (conditions #19-21)
  * Adherent re-adapted - 3x T175 flasks seeded with 20k/cm2 in 20mL of DMEM/F12 + FBS + P/S cultured for 4 days (conditions #22-24)

  




Preparation for Harvest

  1. Prepare 3 falcon tubes for cell harvest for 3 conditions - Suspension cells (#1-6), re-adherent cells (#7-24) and Immunostaining for characterisation (LAB BOOK LINK)
  2. Media preparation for harvest and seeding: 50-50 RPMI/Hycell mix
    1. Aliquot 180mL of 50-50 RPMI/Hycell  growth medium (GM) and add growth factors (concentration listed in the E8 Calculator)
    2. Aliquot 150mL of  DMEM/F12+10%FBS
    3. Aliquot 120mL of  DMEM/F12+18mg/ml BSA+ITS 

Cell Harvest for mould seeding - Nuvonis suspesion protocol

  1. Harvest cells with Cell Supply passaging protocol
  2. Count cells with haemocytometer/Vicell for total yields:
    1. Total yield flask #12589 =    440 million   

    2. Total volume per flask #12589 =    134.35mL  
    3. Cell concentration # =     3.26M cells/mL  
  3. Aliquot cell suspension from the culture flask into 3x falcon tubes:
    1.  Conditions #1-6 =  45M   cell total required for Suspension conditions. Aliquot a cell suspension total volume of =    14mL  # into a 50mL falcon tube and complete with  6mL  GM
    2. Conditions #7-24 =   63M   cell total required for Suspension conditions. Aliquot a cell suspension total volume of =    19.3mL  # into a 50mL falcon tube and complete with  0.7mL  GM
    3. Immunostaining characterisation expt =   960k   cell total required for Suspension conditions. Aliquot a cell suspension total volume of =    0.3mL  # into a 50mL falcon tube and complete with  19.7mL  PBS
  4. Centrifuge at 500g for 5 minutes: start  : am 
  5. Resuspend pellets in   600uL of 50-50 Media 
  6. Then measure out exactly how much the cells has increased the volume by using the P1000.
  7. Top up the cell suspension to  1843.8uL 
  8. Aliquot the respective volumes of cell+media needed per condition.  
    1. 9% Matrigel: 413.7 uL
    2. 6% Matrigel: 445.2 uL 
    3. 3% Matrigel: 476.7 uL
    4. 0% Matrigel: 508.2 uL 
  9. Proceed to matrix additions below. 

  

Matrix formation for scaffold seeding - 4 Matrigel conditions (6
tissues/condition)

N.B. Repeat this gel formation for each Eppendorf tube at the same time - i.e.
Add Collagen to all, then add DMEM to all etc. - BUT be sure to move quickly!

  1. Add Collagen I (Devro: final concentration 2.6mg/ml) and mix well with stripette (not resuspending):
    1. Collagen I volume to add =     426.3uL  
  2. Add 10xDMEM/F12 and mix with stripette:
    1. 10x DMEM volume to add =    51.45iL  
  3. Add 0.1M Sodium Hydroxide and mix with stripette:
    1. NaOH volume to add =    64.05uL  
  4. Add Matrigel and mix with stripette:
    1. Matrigel volume needed to each (for each condition)
      1. 9% Matrigel  94.5uL  
      2. 6% Matrigel  63uL  
      3. 3% Matrigel  31.5L  
      4. 0% Matrigel   0uL  
    2. Matri
  5. Remove pluronic from wells
  6. Seed    150uL    gel/matrix gently into scaffold ensuring good distribution around pillars in the well. 
  7. Leave for    60-90    minutes to gel at 37°C - start time    : pm  
  8. Add     ~13 mL   50-50 Media to entire dish, ensure entire mould is covered
  9. Culture at 37°C overnight before checking. 




Tips and Tricks for this protocol:

  * When pelleting cells, make sure they are completely dry
  * Flick pellet to dislodge before adding medium
  * Add Medium first to pellet to prevent clumping and cell death
  * Col1 is very viscous, pipette carefully - when adding 10x DMEM, it turns yellow
  * As soon as you add the NaOH, be quick as the Col starts to gel
  * Everything has to be exact, don't be tempted to add more cells than the volume stated if there are some left
  * Add cells slowly!
