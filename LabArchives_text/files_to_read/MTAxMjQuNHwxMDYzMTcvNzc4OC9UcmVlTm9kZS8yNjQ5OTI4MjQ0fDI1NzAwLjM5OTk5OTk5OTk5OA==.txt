Process:

  1. Placed the  50 mL aliquot of  Growth Media in the bead bath set at 37 C for 20 minutes or until warm to the touch.
  2. Removed  15 mL and 6 mL (50%) supernatant from each T175 and T75 vessels respectively (you can use the same tip for the same SCC as they contain the same single cell clones BUT please change tips when handling different SCC).
  3. Replaced with 15 and 6 mL of growth media per T175 and T75 respectively (please change tips to feed each T175 in order to avoid cross-contaminating the media).
  4. Returned vessel to incubate at:

  * [ ]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (aviary cells)
  * [X]  30ºC, 5% CO2 (reptilian cells)

  

  * Incubator (#140), Lab [Library]
