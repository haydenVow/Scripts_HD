aliquotsIn 5 x 1.5 mL microtubes in a 50 mL tube container  
3 of the wells contain the same media as used for E125 feed, so there is
enough media in the E125 aliquots for these three wells.

Process:

  1. Place pre-aliquoted aliquots in water bath to be warmed:  
Placed in water bath:   10:45  

  2. Collected culture vessels from shakers, wiped with ethanol-sprayed cloth and brought into BSC (if necessary, paused shakers by pressing the "play" button on the controller on the side wall of the incubator)     
  3.  ~~Using a p1000 for the 6-well plate cultures and a 5 mL serelogical pipette for the E125 flasks, gently pipette-mixed cultures for ~1 minute to break up cell clumps~~
  4.  ~~Pipetted suspensions though 70 um cell strainer into 8 x 15 mL tubes  and 3 x 50 mL tubes (keep E125 flask and 6-well plates in BSC as cultures will be returned to these post centrifugation) ~~
  5. Centrifuged at 300 x g for 5 min. Timestamp:11:17 - 11:22 and 11:24-11:29         

  6. Aspirated 50% of supernatants (1.5 mL for 6-well plate cultures and 15 mL for E125 cultures), taking care to not disrupt or aspirate pellet
  7. Re-suspended all cultures in 1.5 mL (6-well plate) or 15 mL (e125) of their respective growth media (see plate map above). 
  8. Gently pipette-mixed cultures again before moving back to E125 flask and 2 x 6-well plates 
  9. Returned vessels to incubator and replaced in clamp. If shaker was paused, remembered to press play to restart shaking. 6-well plates should be shaking at 150 RPM and E125 at 120 RPM) Timestamp:  11:50 and 11:55

### Observations/Summary:

 50 % media changed on vessel(s)

  1. 7502-F_DOLLY12-Sheep P8-1of2
    1. Volume in wells was ~2 mL, so medium change was closer to 75%
  2. 7503-F_DOLLY12-Sheep P8-2of2
    1. Volume in wells was ~2 mL, so medium change was closer to 75%
  3. 7504-F_DOLLY12-Sheep P8-1of3
  4. 7505-F_DOLLY12-Sheep P8-2of3
  5. 7506-F_DOLLY12-Sheep P8-3of3
