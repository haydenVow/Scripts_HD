CHOMP BLOOD SUSPENSION TRIAL  
Will be performed in static culture.  

D0  
Pre-plate- Thaw 1 vial of raw homogenate (trypsin digested) and plate in 1x
well of a 6 well plate.  
Culture media: DMEM/F12 +20% FBS + 1x P/S for all cultures.  
  
D1  
 1\. Remove the supernatant add to 7ml of pre-warmed PBS (to wash and increase
suspension volume before filtering). The remaining adherent cell can be
expanded and used elsewhere.  
 2\. Pass cell suspension through a 70um cell strainer.  
 3\. Centrifuge at 300g for 5min.  
 4\. Re-suspend cells in 3mL fresh growth media  
 5\. Take a sample to perform a blood smear. Prepare smear and stain with
Wright's stain for cell type analysis.  
 6\. Perform a cell count using trypan blue.  
 7\. Re-plate cells in a 6-well plate and return to incubate.

Repeat staining and counting protocol every 4 days for 30 days or longer.
