Key findings

  1.   




Discussion

\- HDAC2 and 10 uM P53i conditions saw the largest decline in cell numbers
between day 0 and day 13. All conditions recovered to a similar cell count as
other conditions by day 20

\- General uptick in cell counts around day 14 (seen this in the past)

\- HDAC1 cultures dropped after feed where they did not get HDACs, and then
returned to pre-feed levels after HDACs returned to culture. This may have
been due
