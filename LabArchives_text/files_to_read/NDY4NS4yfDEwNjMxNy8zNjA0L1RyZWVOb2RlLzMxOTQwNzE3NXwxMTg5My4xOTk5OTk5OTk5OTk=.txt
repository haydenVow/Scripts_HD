Prepare materials for thaw and seed:

2\. Aliquotted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then
placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath for a minimum of 20 minutes
prior to use:

  *  Growth media (for topping up freeze media in vials with GM):    1.5 mL 
  * Time that aliquot was placed in the water bath to warm before use:   13:40 a/pm 

  




## Thaw and seed vial:

3\. Collected the cryovial from Liquid Nitrogen storage & place in foam
floater in water bath for 5 min 13 43: - 13:48 a/pm

Location where cryovial was collected from:

Vial details:  2   x  1mL  cryovials at   1M  cells each for a total of    2M
cells

Brew

Tower/Bucket # 5

Box/Cane # 3

Vial location: F3, F4  

Vial ID(s): 2329, 2328  

`4. Ethanol sprayed & transferred the vial(s) to the BSC.`

`5.  Added  500µL of Growth Media (to generate a total volume of 1mL in the
cryovial) to the cryovial, resuspended the cell suspension gently to reduce
osmotic shock. `

`6. Collected the entire 500uL of cell suspension `#2329 `& transfer into the
pre-warmed tube of Condition 1.`

`Collected the entire 500uL of cell suspension in `#2329` & transfer into the
pre-warmed tube of Condition 2.`

`Collected the entire 500uL of cell suspension in #2328 & transfer into the
pre-warmed tube of Condition 3.  
`

`7. Using a 10mL serological pipette, resuspended & distributed 500K cells
each evenly in the   11mL of pre-warmed aliquots of Conditions 1, 2 and 3.`

`8. Transfered   11.5mL to each pre-coated  T75  flask/well.  
`

`9. Transfered flask/plate(s) to incubate at 13:55 in the main lab Thermo
reach-in incubator: `

  * [X]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (aviary cells)

  

Making labels

Note - You will need to increase the passage number by one. (i.e. if your
thawed vial ID has a passage number of 3, when you make a culture ID for you
vessel you will need change the passage number to 4 on Airtable.)
