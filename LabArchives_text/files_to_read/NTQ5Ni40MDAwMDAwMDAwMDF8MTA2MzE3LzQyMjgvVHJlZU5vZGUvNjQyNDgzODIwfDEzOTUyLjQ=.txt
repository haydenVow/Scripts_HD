AIM/PURPOSE: Increase myoblast expansion yield

HYPOTHESIS: Vitamin C supplementation will increase yield as shown for
fibroblasts but not affect the differentiation potential of myoyblasts

RESULTS SUMMARY: After performing 2 separate tests, we observed that addition
of vitamin c in our growth media resulted in 1.2x to 1.4x better yield of
DOLLY12 cells compared to those without treatment. We also found that Vitamin
C treatment did not have a negative impact on early stage cell differentiation
when we seeded them into two separate studies that took the cells further in
differentiation.

CONCLUSIONS: Vitamin C supplementation is a promising low-cost approach to
increasing myoblast expansion yields

NEXT STEPS: Need to further investigate the long-term effects of using vitamin
c on our muscle cells
