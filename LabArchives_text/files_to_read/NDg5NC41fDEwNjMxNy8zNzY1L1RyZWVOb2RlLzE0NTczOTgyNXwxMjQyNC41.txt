Method:  
  
1\. Remove the lid from a 60 mm tissue culture dish and place 5 mls of PBS in
the bottom of the dish. This will act as a hydration chamber.

2\. Invert the lid and use a 20 μl pipettor to deposit 10 μL drops of DMEM/F12
+ 10% FBS onto the bottom of the lid. Make sure that drops are placed
sufficiently apart so as to not touch. It is possible to place at least 20
drops per dish

3\. Invert the lid onto the PBS-filled bottom chamber.

4\. Can the lid be taken off again, preserving the droplets & the theoretical
cells in their culture? We'll keep different conditions in different lids for
any experiments, but it'd be nice if we could harvest cells from the droplets
rather than having them all mix.

  

Observations:  
  
1\. What is the optimal size of the droplet that can be suspended from the
lid?

10 uL is a good size, it allows for a sizable droplet that is easy to deposit
with the pipette without smearing or losing it's form.

10 uL droplets after 15 minutes incubation (37'C, 5% CO2)

Also tried:

1) 20 uL - worked as well but the droplets were more prone to spilling and
losing their shape.

3) 30 uL (to see if we can use multi-channel) - far too big  
  
2\. What is the optimal number of droplets per lid?

Can do around 20 per lid without mixing between droplets (of 60 mm plate)  
  
3\. Can we focus on the inside of the droplets using our microscopes? (Might
need to suspend some cells or debris in the media to answer this question.

Yes! Tested with Countest test beads (same size as cells - ~10um). With plate
lid sitting inverted inside larger (100 mm plate) we could focus on Countess
test beads. Best results were seen using the Primo microscope, although it is
unclear as to whether this is a difference in microscopes or because we tried
the Primo after the Axio and the cells may have settled into more of a
monolayer.

Axio, 10X

Setup for imaging

 4\. Any other observations/considerations? Could consider comparing different
medias (e.g. does RPMI have a different surface tension than DMEM/F12?)

RPMI and DMEM/F12 appeared to behave identically in droplet form
