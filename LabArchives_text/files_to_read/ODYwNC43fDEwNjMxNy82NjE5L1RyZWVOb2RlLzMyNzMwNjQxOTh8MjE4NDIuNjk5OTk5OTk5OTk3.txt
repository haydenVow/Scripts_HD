Process:

Passaging of Quail Suspension Cells Notes:

1\. After performing cell count, suspension from all 4 e-125 flasks was
transferred to 1 flat bottom e-500 flask.  
2\. E-125 flasks washed with a total of 60mL fresh suspension media, which was
then added to the e-500, giving a total volume of 140mL.  
Cell density= 52,000/mL  
3\. The e-500 flask containing all the cells was returned to the incubator at
37C, 5% C02 and a shaking speed of 120RPM.
