Consulted with Marie and Katie yesterday evening about the morphology and slow
growth of these cells. Marie mentioned that the the 'spikey' morphology was
not something to be alarmed about. The cells may be responding to stressful
conditions of the thaw. They also could have been responding to the low
confluence after seeding. We seeded from thaw at 956 cells per cm^2 and saw a
lot of cell death the following day.

In any case I consulted with Tom this morning about how we should progress
these cells. I mentioned that we could either split them into more T175 flasks
to expand further in order to seed them on second passage into planar culture,
suspension culture and a diff assay.  

Alternatively we could split them to planar culture and a suspension culture
today but we may not have enough to start a diff assay.

Tom mentioned that it would be best to expand them up in order to more T175
flasks.

### Process:

1\. Took image of vessel with microscope on phase setting [11:24am]. Assessed
that the confluence of each flask was roughly 30%. See images in the image
reference section.

2\. Returned the cultures to the incubator [11:28]

2\. Gelatin coated     8     x     T175     vessel with sterile filtered 0.1%
gelatin solution and then incubated all coated flasks at 37˚C.

  1. Time when all vessels(s) placed into the incubator       11:44   a/pm 

3\. Aliquotted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then
placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath for a minimum of 20 minutes
prior to use:

  1. TrypLE:     30    mL in    1x50     tubes
  2.  dPBS (for washing and neutralising):    30     mL in    1x50mL    tubes
  3. Growth media (for pellet resuspension + seeding):     241    mL in     1x500mL    container

Time that all aliquots were placed in the water bath the warm before use
12:06   a/pm

Note: if aliquots were placed in water bath at different time, record the time
stamp for each individual solution.




4\. Removed vessel(s) from the incubator     12:15   a/pm

5\. Washed the vessel(s) with 10mL dPBS (warmed).

6\. Added     10    mL tryple to each vessel/well and incubated at 37˚C.

  1. Start/Finish for TrypLE was     12:21-12:35   a/pm (left the cells to incubate for an extra 4 minutes as cells had not completely detached after 10 minutes).   

7\. Neutralised with     10mL     dPBS and combined cell suspensions into two
50mL     tubes, 30mL per tube.

8\. Centrifuged at 650 x g for 5 min.

  1. Start/Finish time for centrifugation was     12:44-12:49   a/pm 




9\. Aspirated the supernatant(s).

10\. Resuspended pellet(s) in     1.5    mL     growth     media     13:00
a/pm

11\. Aliquoted     10uL     of resuspended cells into a microcentrifuge tube
for cell count.

12\. Performed a cell count using the haemocytometer and recorded the cell
count data in the Google Doc spreadsheet called 'Cell Count Spreadsheet' (see
link below):

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1DPzKubYxfHmWogVPihC-
SSIBtIylyrBQE5kRX5Z8NtI/edit#gid=0&range=1000:1000

  1.  Total cell number was:       684000      

  2. Volume of cell suspension required for subculture was:      All       

  3. Expected Cell density per vessel (4xT175s) :    171000      




Removed half of the media from the pre warmed aliquot, bringing the total
volume down to 120mL. The 120mL that was removed was placed into a 120mL
container and stored in the fridge to be used for feeding over the weekend.

13\. Transferred  all  of the counted cell suspension to the pre-warmed
120    mL Growth media:      13:20    a/pm

14\. Transferred the cell suspension into 4x pre-gelatin coated     T175
flasks       vessel.

15\. Left at RT in the BSC for 30 min to allow cells to settle      13:26  \-
13:55 a/pm  

16\. Transferred vessel(s) to incubate at:

  * [x]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells), incubator 67
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (avian cells)

Observations/Summary:

Cells were more obviously in clustered colonies when imaged today, suggesting
they are proliferating.

Cells still appeared to have the spikey morphology observed yesterday.

Cell yield was low which was unexpected, could only expand up to 4xT175s, each
T175 having a cell density of 0.977 cells/cm^2
