With a view to expanding the diversity of our cell banks, Vow has sourced a a
Bennetts Wallaby (also known as a Red-necked Wallaby) sample from Lenah Game
Meats in Tasmania. Due to their hardiness and rapid rates of proliferation,
Vow currently uses fibroblasts for the majority of our R&D including in the
key areas of suspension cell adaption, as well as product development. For
this reason, our initial culture will focus on the expansion of the plastic
adherent population within the crude homogenate. We will also freeze potions
of the isolate however, so that if desired, other cell types may also be
selected for when culturing in the future.  
  
We plan to follow the biopsy, isolation and culture protocols previously
developed by Vow for the isolation of primary cells from mammalian tissue as
we believe these techniques will be transferable to marsupial tissues and
cells.
