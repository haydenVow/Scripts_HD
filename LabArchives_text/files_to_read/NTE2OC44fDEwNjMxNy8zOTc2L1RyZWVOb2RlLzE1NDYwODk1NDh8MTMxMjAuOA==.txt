Process:

  1. Aliquoted growth media as follows:
    * 25 mL of CDCHO media in 50 mL tubes
    * Added FGF-B and IGF-1 (100 ng/mL) to each aliquot
      * Placed in water bath   15:10    

  2. Prepared stain buffer in 15 mL tube by combining the following (1 drop of each stain solution per 1 mL of dPBS):
    * 3 mL of dPBS 
    * 6 drops of NucBlue Live Cell Stain ReadyProbes Hoechst 33342
    * 3 drops of NucGreen Dead 488 Cell Stain ReadyProbes Sytox Green
      * Vortexted mix for ~5 seconds, then stored in dark until ready to use.    Not performed     

  
E-125 flasks

  1. Collected E125s from shaker, wiped with ethanol-sprayed Rediwipe, and brought into BSC 15:20
  2. Using a 25 mL serelogical pipette, gently pipette-mixed culture for 1 minute to break up cell clumps
  3. Pipette suspension though 70 um cell strainer into 2 x 50 mL tubes. Kept E125 vessels in BSC, as culture will be returned to this vessel after feed. 
  4. Centrifuged 50 mL tubes at 300 x g for 5 min. 15:19 - 15:24  

  5. Aspirated  100% (25 mL) of supernatant, taking extra care to not disrupt or aspirate pellet 
  6. Resuspended in 100 uL of medium
  7. Took 1 x 10 uL sample for haemocytometer cell count
  8. Added  25 mL of fresh, warmed growth media to each 50 mL tube
  9. Gently pipette-mixed cultures using serelogical, before moving cell suspension back to E125s
  10. Took 100 uL sample from each culture and stored in separate microtubes until ready to stain alongside 50 mL shake tubes.  
Cell count: 820,400

  11. Returned E125s to incubator.   15:35
