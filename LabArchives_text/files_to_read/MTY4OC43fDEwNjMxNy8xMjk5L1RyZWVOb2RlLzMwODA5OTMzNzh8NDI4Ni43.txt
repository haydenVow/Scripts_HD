Prepare materials for thaw and seed:

1\. Gelatin coated  5  x  T25  flasks/plates with sterile filtered 0.1%
gelatin solution and then incubated all coated flasks at 37ºC

  * Time when all flasks placed into the incubator   13:12  

2\. Aliquotted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then
placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath for a minimum of 20 minutes
prior to use:

  * Growth media (for resuspension and counts): 30 ml in 1 tube
  * Growth media (for seeding):    20 mL in  1  tubes 
  * Time that aliquot was placed in the water bath to warm before use:  13 :24

## Thaw and seed vial:

  1. collected the cryovial from Liquid Nitrogen storage & place in foam floater in water bath for 5 min  17:20 - 17:25 a/pm 
  2. Location where cryovial was collected from: 
  3. Vial details:   1  cryovials containing 540 K  cells 
    1. Brew 
    2. Tower/Bucket # 1   

    3. Box/Cane # 1   

    4. Vial location: A4
    5. Vial ID(s): 2203-Culture-6066-Vial-4of74
  4. `Ethanol sprayed & transferred the vial(s) to the BSC.`
  5. `Added  500 µL of Growth Media (to generate a total volume of 1mL in the cryovial) to the cryovial, resuspended the cell suspension gently to reduce osmotic shock. `
  6.  Took 10uL of suspension for a cell count.
    1. Total cell count: 744k cells
    2. 125k cells = 
  7. Prepared a cell suspension of 125k cells in 25 mL media.
  8. `Transfered   5 mL to each pre-coated  T25  flask/well, allow to rest in the BSC at RT for 30 min  17:45 - 18:15 a/pm `
  9. `Transfered flask/plate(s) to incubate at: `

  * [X]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (aviary cells)

  

Making labels

Note - You will need to increase the passage number by one. (i.e. if your
thawed vial ID has a passage number of 3, when you make a culture ID for you
vessel you will need change the passage number to 4 on Airtable.)

Summary:

Thawed 1x vial of DOLLY12 WCB and seeded T25 flasks at 1000cells/cm^2.  

  




### Results:

  * Results were;
    * [X]  As Usual (this is a repetitive task)
    * [ ]  Unexpected because...
    * [ ]  Need to be further analysed
    * [ ]  Other (.......)
