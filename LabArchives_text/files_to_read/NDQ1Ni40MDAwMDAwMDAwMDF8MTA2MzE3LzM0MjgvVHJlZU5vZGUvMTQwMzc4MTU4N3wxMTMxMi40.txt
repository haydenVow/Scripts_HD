Perform feed using below volumes:

  




Differentiation Media:

  * E6  
  
Total media required: 24 mL

Media aliquoted into a black 50 mL falcon tube labelled 'SAT' on the top and
'E6 ESTIM' on the side. Aliquot left in the Main Lab Biomaterials Fridge.

## Imaging

Imaged both plates, taking whole well images of every well using the zaber
time - ATTEMPTED BUT WAS UNABLE TO 11:40

Tips for imaging the 12WP are to use 8x8 imaging sites in the HSC site
generator, remembering to change the spacing rule to field of view with 60 um
spacing. Remember to build the MM List in the HSC site generator and confirm
the number of images expected (usually >700) in the Mult-D Acq.




Process:

1\. Aliquoted  1x 48 mL  mL of  E6 Dif Media into  1x 50mL  tube(s). Labelled
aliquots with the feed date and 'EPIC21489'.  
Placed aliquots in media fridge 74 in main lab 10:40 11/08  

Note, only 24 mL is actually needed for this feed, but the aliquots may have
48 mL. Discard remaining.  
  
2\. Aliquots placed in water bath   10:12 am  

3\. Removed the hook test clips from the electrode connection pins on the
culture dish lid and moved culture dish to the BSC.  time 11:57 (TIME MOVED
INTO BSC)  
  
The test hook can be released from the pin by squeezing the spring loaded test
hook handle. It is best not to touch the metal electrode pins while doing
this. Hold the plastic culture dish lid for stability. If any wires become
dislodged and the operator is unsure about reattachment, contact experiment
owner for assistance   Jared - 0420881185  

4\. Removed and placed the electrode culture lid on its back inside the
incubator to keep the electrodes sterile.

5\.  100% of supernatant from the vessel was removed. A P1000 or a 5 mL
serological is appropriate here to remove the supernatant.

6\. Replaced with  2mL (per well/per vessel) of  E6 Dif  media. A P1000 here
is appropriate, since the media volume needs to be consistent between wells
for EStim.

7\. Returned vessel to incubate and connected the test hooks back up to the
electrode pins on the culture dish lid so that each set of hooks connects to
the corresponding wire colour and so that the black hooks are aligned on the
left side of each well and the red hooks on the right (see wiring setup
reference image below)   time 12:06

### Observations/Summary:

 100 % media changed on vessel(s)

  1. All vessels.

Operator (KK) was unable to use zaber. Took images on the primo instead.
Noticed that the first well has a lot more cell debrie (dead cells), and not
many live cells attached to the culture dish.
