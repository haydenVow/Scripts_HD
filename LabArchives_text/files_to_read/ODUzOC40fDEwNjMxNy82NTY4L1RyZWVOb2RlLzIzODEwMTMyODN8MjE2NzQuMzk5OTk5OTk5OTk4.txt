Cell Suspensions

1\. Make up a 15M / 100 uL cell suspension (150M / mL)

2\. Make up a 5M / 5 mL cell suspension (1M / mL)

Note: 2 x 10M vials required.




Method

1\. Cut strip of parafilm and overlaid on empty P10 tip box. Used eppendorf
tube to create dimples / wells in the parafilm strip.

2\. Acquire and label x eppendorf tubes - dependent on how many wells will be
required for the XTT assay.

4\. Added 100 uL alginate to each eppendorf tube.

5\. Added 20 uL of cell suspension at a density of x cells / mL.

5\. Added x uL of functionalising reagent to each of the tubes and gently
mixed by stirring motion with pipette. (Add to tube only when ready to
pipette).

7\. Used P200 to dispense droplets onto parafilm in each well.

8\. Transfer strip of parafilm into a sufficiently wide petri dish.

9\. Incubated at 37Â°C for 30 minutes (entire strip of parafilm placed in
incubation) at ____

10\. Removed from incubator at ____

10\. Added CaCl2 directly onto parafilm to bathe droplets at ____ and cross-
link the alginate.

12\. Moved the alginate beads into the wells at ____

  

Additional Information / Timestamps

Vials thawed: ____, x M each

Added 1mL to each vial and added both to single 15mL falcon tube at ____

Spun down at: ____

Resuspended cells in x mL growth media total, took sample for count 1:10
dilution with trypan blue.
