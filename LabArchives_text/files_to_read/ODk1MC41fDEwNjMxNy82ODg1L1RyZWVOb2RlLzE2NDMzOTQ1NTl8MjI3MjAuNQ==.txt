Harvested the cells

  1. Switch the following parameters to off before removing the culture medium
    1. Temperature control MODE to OFF
    2. pH control MODE to OFF
    3. Dissolved oxygen control MODE to OFF
    4. Level control MODE to OFF
    5. Exhaust heater MODE to OFF
    6. SUBS-B pump MODE to OFF
    7. BASET pump MODE to OFF
    8. LEVELT pump MODE to OFF
    9. Air MODE to OFF
    10. O2 MODE to OFF
    11. N2 MODE to OFF  
  

  2. Stopped data logging *Ensure this is stopped before the culture medium drops below the bottom of the dO2 and pH probe
  3. Manual stirring at 90 RPM maintained 
  4. Pumped out culture medium into 2L harvest bottle

Recovered cell pellet and performed cell count

  1. Transferred 2 L of cell suspension to 200 mL centrifuge tubes
  2. Centrifuged at 3000 x g for 5 minutes
  3. Aspirated the supernatants
  4. Resuspended the individual pellets in 10 mL of dPBS
  5. Combined all pellets into 1 tube
  6. Washed down cells in tube with ~50 mL of dPBS
  7. Centrifuge cells and repeat wash with dPBS
  8. Took a 50 uL aliquot
  9. Perform an appropriate dilution of the cells with Trypan blue solution to the aliquot
  10. Pipet mixed the cell suspension and Trypan blue, then performed total cell count by the Trypan blue exclusion method using phase contrast microscopy and an improved Neubauer hemocytometer.

Single use bioreactor pack-up and disposal:

  1. Stopped the stirrer and any other remaining functions
  2. Turned off the power to the bioreactor 
  3. Disconnect heating blanket and exhaust heater from the bioreactor
  4. Disconnect the gas line from the bioreactor
  5. Disconnect all tubing from any harvest/feed/waste and base bottles from the Mobius bioreactor
  6. Remove pH and pO2 probes from the bioreactor 
  7. Disconnect the stirrer motor
    1. Ensure the adaptor is disconnected when using single-use vessel

  

Prepared bioreactor for storage or reuse

  1. Transferred bioreactor vessel and all bottles to a trolley.
  2. Moved bioreactor and all bottles to a sink.
  3. All waste was tipped down the sink with the tap running
  4. All "wetted" surfaces of the bioreactor vessel and bottles were rinsed thoroughly with deionized or reverse-osmosis water.
    1. If storing, all parts were transferred back to the bioreactor bench where they were left to air dry.
    2. If reusing, all parts were reassembled for autoclaving
