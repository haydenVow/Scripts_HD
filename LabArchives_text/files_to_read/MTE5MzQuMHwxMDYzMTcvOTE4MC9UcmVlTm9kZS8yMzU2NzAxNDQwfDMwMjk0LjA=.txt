Process

For buffer preparation and assay protocol specifics, please see experimental
plan entry  

  1. Brought kits out of fridge/freezer and thawed at bench
  2. Prepared 20mL 1x RIPA buffer in MilliQ water and prepared with 1:200 protease cocktail inhibitors (100uL)
  3. Prepared working stock of EGF and IGF1-LR3 to spike Morsel samples with. See G-sheet for stock concentration preparation.
  4. Prepared unknown samples to 1mg/mL final concentration as per G-sheet. Prepared growth factor spiked samples by adding 10uL of working stock to each sample
  5. Prepared wash buffer, 5mL concentrate plus 145mL MilliQ water
  6. Reserved unused wells from plate frame and stored in plate packaging 
  7. Prepared standards in RIPA buffer as per manufacturer's recommendations
  8. Prepared reagent A and B, 1:100 in respective diluent to a total of 6mL (6mL diluent + 60uL reagent stock)
  9. Added 100uL standards and unknown samples to plate, careful not to touch. Plated as per plate layout specified in G-sheet. Sealed with provided plate seal sticker
  10. Started incubation at 37degC for 1 hour at 13:05 AM 
  11. Retrieved from incubator at 14:09 PM
  12. Removed liquid from wells and immediately added 100uL per well of detection reagent A
  13. Returned to incubator for 1 hour incubation at 14:24 PM
  14. Retrieved from incubator at 15:24 PM
  15. Aspirated solution, rinsed with 350uL per well wash solution 3 times. Blotted excess
  16. Added 100uL per well detection reagent B, covered with plate sealer
  17. Returned to incubator at for 30 minute incubation 15:45 PM 
  18. Retrieved from incubator at 16:15 PM
  19. Aspirated solution, rinsed with 350uL/well wash solution 5 times. Blotted excess
  20. Added 90uL per well detection substrate solution, covered with plate sealer. Added at Incubation time 10-20 minutes. Check plate every 5 minutes and inspect colour change.Started incubation at:
    * 16:35 PM EGF plate
    * 16:40 PMIGF plate
  21. Stopped when curve resolved with distinctive gradient. Removed from incubation at:
    * 16:55 PM EGF plate
    * 16:xx PM IGF plate
  22. Added 50uL per well Stop solution. Gently tapped plate to ensure uniform mixing
  23. Ensured plate bottom was clear of marks/droplets and no bubbles in wells 
  24. Read absorbance at 450nm in plate reader
  25. See attached for exported data
  26. See G-sheet for standard curve and data summary
