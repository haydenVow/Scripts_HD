Reagent preperation

1\. Aliquotted 600 mL + 300 Ml   of  E6 Media in weekend media box. Placed in
water bath   9:25 am




Cell factory Process

  1. Unscrew white cap and remove blue cap and place aside.
  2. Removed   100%   of supernatant Cell Factory by carefully pouring into a waste container with volume marking.
  3. Replaced with 600 mL OR 300 ML  (per flask) of growth media by carefully pouring media through the white cap opening 
  4. Place caps back and equalise 4CF by placing it on its side (blue cap on the bottom and white cap on the top, see image below:)  
  

4\. Returned vessel to incubate at: 10:53 am

  * [x]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (aviary cells)

  

  * [x]  Contherm 118
  * [ ]  Top Sanyo Incubator (ID #25)
  * [ ]  Bottom Sanyo Incubator
  * [ ]  Top Binder Incubator
  * [ ]  Bottom Binder Incubator
