Note

Cultures BIRDKO (BOBBY line cultured in KSR based media in planar culture,
followed by OptiPRO media in suspension) and BOBBKA (BOBBY line cultured in
KSR based media in planar culture, followed by CDM4 Avian media in suspension)
were discarded today due to very low counts.

Hoechst/Nuc green staining and counting was performed in addition to duplicate
trypan blue counts, in order to demonstrate discrepancies between the methods.

Since 8/3/22 EGF 10ug/L, IGF,50ug/L is being added to all cultures in this
experiment.

Process:  

  1. Place media in water bath >15min prior to use
  2. Collected E125s from shaker, wiped with ethanol-sprayed Rediwipe, and brought into BSC 
  3. Using a 25 mL serological pipette, gently pipette-mixed culture for 1 minute to break up cell clumps
  4. Transfer suspension into 50 mL tubes, passing through a 70um cell filter. 
  5. Centrifuged 50 mL tubes at 300 x g for 5 mins 
  6. Aspirated  75% (15 mL) of supernatant, taking extra care to not disrupt or aspirate pellet.
  7. Resuspended each pellet in the remaining 5mL of media, and took 2x 10ul samples for haemocytometer counts 
  8. Topped up each 50 mL centrifuge tube with 15 mL of fresh pre-warmed media and resuspended cell pellet. 
  9. Gently pipette-mixed cultures, and transfer all cultures to E250 flask
  10. Returned E250 to incubator
