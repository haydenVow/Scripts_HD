Note  
As live/dead staining, imaging with the zaber, and then quantifying cells with
the Mia macro has proven to be inaccurate, trypan blue staining, and manual
counts using the haemocytometer were performed today.  
  
Cells in the BIRDY culture in Avian media, contained very small cells. The
cells had a halo typical of live staining, however the majority also appeared
to take up the trypan blue stain, which is typical of dead cells. Only cells
with a halo, and excluded trypan blue were included in this count.

Process:  

  1. Place media in water bath >15min prior to use
  2. Collected E125s from shaker, wiped with ethanol-sprayed Rediwipe, and brought into BSC 
  3. Using a 25 mL serological pipette, gently pipette-mixed culture for 1 minute to break up cell clumps
  4. Transfer suspension into 50 mL tubes
  5. Centrifuged 50 mL tubes at 300 x g for 5 mins 
  6. Aspirated  75% (15 mL) of supernatant, taking extra care to not disrupt or aspirate pellet.
  7. Using a 1mL pipetette, removed media down to 1mL (retained to be added back to cultures)
  8. Took 2x 10ul samples from each culture and performed trypan blue cell counts with haemocytometer.

  9. For each of the cultures being retained, topped up each 50 mL centrifuge tube with 15 mL of fresh pre-warmed media and resuspended cell pellet. 
  10. Returned E250 to incubator
