Preparation of methylcellulose stock solution in MilliQ + growth media:

1\. Prep a water bath of pre cooled water (1-4'C).

2\. Weight out the required amount of MC (1g) to prepare a 100 mL solution of
1% MC (w/v). One solution will be MilliQ water and the other just standard
growth media.

3\. Whilst keeping the solutions submerged within the water bath add the MC
powder and attempt to dissolve the MC into the cold media using a
stirrer/spatula to reduce the amount of clumps/aggregates as much as possible.
Use the highest stir speed that doesn't result in splashing (alternatively can
put a lid on), so that the small aggregates get broken up.

4\. After 5-10 minutes of stirring transfer the solution into the fridge and
leave it overnight. 15:55. Media placed in fridge 74.

5\. Image the solution prior to equilibrating it at 4'C overnight and the
following day.

6\. Sterilise filter the solution through a 0.22 um filter unit.
