The components used to create the 50:50 growth medium and the volumes used to
add the growth factors were calculated in the E8 calculator.

  




  

  1. Add growth factors to the growth media. 
  2. Place growth media aliquot in the waterbath (37C) for minimum 20 minutes 10:37-  
  

  3. Bring reagents and hydrogel to RT for 1 hour. 
  4. Remove spent media from cells and rinse briefly with PBS. 
  5. Passage cells. 
  6. Perform cell count. Density for experiments: 10 million cells / mL (required density to be proven). 
  7. While counting, centrifuge cell suspension for 5 mins at 500g.
  8. Based on cell count, use c1V1=c2V2 to determine amount of hydrogel required.
  9. Using a 5 mL syringe, stir hydrogel and draw up required amount and transfer to sterile Eppendorf tube.
  10. Remove supernatant from cells, resuspend in media (~50uL/mL of hydrogel). Transfer to hydrogel in tube with a 1mL pipette, slowly stirring into ink as you do. Make sure to get into tip of cartridge and that it entirely incorporated (~1.5 min).
  11. Seal eppendorf tube and centrifuge briefly to remove air bubbles.
  12. Draw up into a syringe, add a 18G blunt needle tip and place drops into a 12 well plate.
  13. Add CaCl2 solution (50mM) to drops and crosslink for 15 mins.
  14. Following crosslink, wash scaffolds in media at RT according to this:
    1. 3x 1 min washes
    2. 2x 10 min wash at 37 C
  15. After scaffolds are washed of all excess CaCl2, culture in media.
  16. Leave for 2 to 3 days prior to feeding to ensure stabilisation of construct.
  17. Feed every other day with either top up or half feeds.
