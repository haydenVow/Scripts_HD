1\. Remove culture(s) from the cooling incubator. : am/pm

2\. Look at culture under the microscope to check for cell death,
contamination, and the confluence of cells/ aggregate formation.

## 50% Feed:

3\. Slowing aspirate 50%of the supernatant from each culture (in accordance
with the below table), avoiding disturbing the cells/ aggregate formations
adhered to the vessels.

  * Please avoid opening multiple plates at the same time in the BSC, to prevent the spread of contamination between plates. 

4\. Slowly pipette 50% of the total working growth medium volume back into the
culture vessel, as described in the below table.

or

## Passage:  

3\. Aspirate supernatant.

4\. Wash with PBS (volumes listed in table below)

5\. Tryplise for 10-15 minutes. : am/pm

  * You make need to pipette the cell suspension in tryple up and down, half way through this incubation step if the cells do not appear to detach from the vessel's surface. 

6\. Neutralise the tryple with PBS (volume required is listed below).

7\. Collect the cell suspension in a 50mL tube and centrifuge at 650g for 5
minutes. : am/pm

8\. Aspirate the supernatant and resuspend in respective growth media (volumes
listed below).

  * If cell growth appears to be observed, please seed into a large vessel (based on your best judgement).
