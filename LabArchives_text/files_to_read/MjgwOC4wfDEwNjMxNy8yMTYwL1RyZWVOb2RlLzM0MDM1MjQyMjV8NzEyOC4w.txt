Aim/Purpose


To adapt cells to suspension culture in at least one of the trialled media
conditions.


Hypothesis


1\. When compared to DMEM/F12 and RPMI basal medias, specialised suspension
culture medias CDM4 Avian, CDM4 CHO and CD CHO supplemented with supplemented
with 10% Knockout serum replacement + 1:100 anti-clumping agent + 0.1%
pluronic + 100ng/mL each FGF, IGF1, PDGF, will improve F_DOLLY12 and/or
F_NANDO3  cell survival and proliferation in suspension culture over a 30 day
trial period.

  
1\. When supplemented with 10% Knockout serum replacement + 1:100 anti-
clumping agent + 0.1% pluronic + 100ng/mL each FGF, IGF1, PDGF, at least one
of these specialised medias will support F_DOLLY12 and/or F_NANDO3  cell
survival and proliferation in suspension culture over a 30 day trial period.


Technical Gap


To this date, we have been unable to achieve sustained cell viability and
proliferation of our fibroblast cells in suspension culture for an extended
period (> 14 days).

Commercial suspension culture medias have been development for commercial
applications and for use with specific cell lines and there is limited
published data relating to their use in the adaption of other cell types or
cells from other species to suspension culture.

  


Method/Procedure


D0: Seed cells to suspension culture in 6-well plates and E125 flask.  
F_DOLLY12 cells should be passaged from adherent culture and seeded into
culture vessels at 1M cells/mL.  
F_NANDO2 cells should be thawed directly from frozen pre-plate isolates and
seeded into culture vessels at 100,000 cells/mL.  
  
6 well plates- 5 conditions with a plate each for F_DOLLY12 and F_NANDO2 cells  
3ml of each of the basal medias below supplemented with 10% Knockout serum
replacement + 1:100 anti-clumping agent + 0.1% pluronic + 100ng/mL each FGF,
IGF1, PDGF.

1\. DMEM/F12  
2\. CDM4 Avian  
3\. CDM4 CHO  
4\. CD CHO  
5\. RPMI  
  
E125 flasks - 2 conditions  
1\. F_NANDO3 cells at 100K/ml into 25mL in CDM4 Avian \+ 10% Knockout serum
replacement + 1:100 anti-clumping agent + 0.1% pluronic + 100ng/mL each FGF,
IGF1, PDGF.  
2\. F_DOLLY12 cells at 1M/mL in CD CHO + 10% Knockout serum replacement +
1:100 anti-clumping agent + 0.1% pluronic + 100ng/mL each FGF, IGF1, PDGF.  
  
D4, D8, D12, D16, D20, D24, D28  
Perform 100% media changes every 4 days by centrifuging the cell suspensions
at 300xg for 5 minutes, discarding the supernatant and resuspending cells in
their respective growth medias. E125 flask should also have their contents
filtered through a 70um cell strainer during every feed. 6 well plate cultures
will not be filtered due to their low volumes.

D14, D16, D18, D20, D22, D24, D26, D28, D30  
After cells have been in suspension for 2 weeks, begin sampling every 2 days
for live/dead staining and counting. Cell counts are performed by centrifuging
suspensions at 300xg for 5 min and then resuspending in 500ul (for 6 well
plates) or 1-3mL (for E125 flasks) of growth media. 20ul samples are then
taken for counting using a Hoechst/Propidium iodine staining protocol. On non-
feed days, medium can be retained and returned to cells after the count.
