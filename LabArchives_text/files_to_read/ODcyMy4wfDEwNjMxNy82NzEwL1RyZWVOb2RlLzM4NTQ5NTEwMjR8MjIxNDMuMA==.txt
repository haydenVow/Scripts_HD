15:00, Discovered that the suspension cultures in the 50mL bioreactor tubes
had been set to shake at a speed lower than their ideal shaking speed. As a
result a large cell aggregate visible to the eye had formed in the base of
each culture.

The suspension cultures were moved to the BSC from the incubator where they
were given a thorough mix to break up the pellet. The tubes were then returned
to shake at 205 rpm at 30 degrees, 5% Co2.
