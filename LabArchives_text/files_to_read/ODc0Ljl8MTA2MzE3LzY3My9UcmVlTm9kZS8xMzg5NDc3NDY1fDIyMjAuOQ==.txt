Process:

Seed 3 x 96 well plates with 7,000 cells/well in 140 uL/well  

Gelatin coat 3 plates

  1. Fill a 12 channel reservoir as follows
    1. Wells 1: 11.1 mL of 0.1% Gelatin
    2. Well 5: 6.3 mL of 0.1% gelatin
  2. Calibrate OT2 and run protocol 'YYYY-MM-DD-num-N-gelatin-coat-3-plates'.
    1. start time: 11:36:44 AM
    2. rUN TIME: 4:18 min  

  3. Incubate all plates for at least 1 hr (37ÂºC, 5% CO2). 11:47

Passage and seed cells

Growth media = DMEM/F12 + 20% FBS + 1x P/S + 10uM p38i

  1. Warm in water at 37 degrees C: 14:36
    1. 28 mL DMEM/F12
    2. 42 mL growth media
  2. Obtain cells from cell expansion
    1. Link to lab book entry of harvest: 
  3. Prepare cell suspension:
    1. For seeding 3 plates (7000cells/well in 140uL/well)
      1. `2.1 M cells in 42 mL growth media`
  4. Using this cell suspension prepare 12 channel OT2 reservoir as follows.
    1. For seeding 3 plates:
      1. Well 1: `6.3 mL PBS`
      2. Wells 2 and 3: `13.5 mL basal media (DMEM/F12)`
      3. Wells 4-8: `8.2 mL cell suspension`
  5. Run the following OT2 protocol using the reservoir prepared for seeding 3x plates:  'YYYY-MM-DD-num-N-trial-seed-3-plates'
    1. start run: 5:06:33 PM
    2. run time: 19:20 min
  6. Incubate 3x 96 well plates at 37 degrees, 5% CO2. 17:29
