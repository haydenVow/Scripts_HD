Process:

Note: feeding with 150 mL instead of usual 50% feed (300 mL)

1\. Collected   1 x 1L  foil-wrapped 10C media bottles from "Media & Gelatin"
fridge labelle "LL MON Feed 3x4CFs". Placed in water bath   10:35

2\. Removed foil, ethanol sprayed, and brought media bottles into BSC.

3\. Removed  150  of supernatant from vessel by pouring 150 mL out from each
4CF into a waste container (or use a 50 mL pipette if preferred)

4\. Replaced with  150 mL/4CF of  10C  medium. Pour 150 mL from each bottle
into each 4CF (there are lines drawn in marker to indicate where the 150 mL
blocks are) (again use 50 mL pipette if preferred)

5\. Returned vessel to incubate at:

7082 -  11:05

7081 -  11:00

7080 -  10:55
