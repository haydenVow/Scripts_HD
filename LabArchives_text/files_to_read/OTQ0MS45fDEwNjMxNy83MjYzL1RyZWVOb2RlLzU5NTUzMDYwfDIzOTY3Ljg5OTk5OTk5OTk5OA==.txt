Passage 1 - Thaw 1x vial (1 million cells, Cell line ID: CB01s-p) into 1xT75.


Dolphin cells:  
  
Growth medium: DMEM + GlutaMax with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) 1% penicillin
(10,000 U/mL stock), 1% amphotericin B (250 μg/mL stock)  
Incubation temperature (°C): 37  
Incubation CO2 (%): 5%  
  
1M cells/mL in 1ml per vial  
  
Seed at 7500 live cells/cm2 (5.6K cells for a T75). Remove 600ul then re-
freeze remaining cells in the vial back down in DMEM + GlutaMax with 10% fetal
bovine serum (FBS)1% penicillin/streptomycin (10,000 U/mL stock), supplemented
with 10% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO).  




# Procedure \- Thaw and Seed

### Note: Fibroblasts do NOT require Gelatin coated Flasks, and do NOT require
p38i.

1\. Place new seeding flasks into the 37'C incubator to pre-warm.

2\. Extract required growth media into aliquots as listed in the table below
and place into a heated 37'C water bath for 20  
minutes.  
  
NOTE - 50% GM feed for a T75 would be 5ml, 100% feed would be 10ml

3\. Select the vial/s for thawing. Note the location of the vial in Liquid
Nitrogen(LN) Dewer.  
Path: Stockyard v1 > Frozen Cultures > Select Vial/s (Use highest number
first, ie 62of62)

4\. Obtain selected number of cryovial/s from LN Dewar and thaw in the 37'C
water bath on a foam floater for a maximum of 5 minutes.  
*NOTE: Ensure to wear PPE and work swiftly whilst performing this this task. Ensure to wear cryogloves and face shield when handling the liquid nitrogen dewar. Ask a Vowzer for help if required.

5\. Spray and wipe the cryovial and growth media thoroughly with 70% EtOH and
transfer into the Biohazard Safety Cabinet (BSC).

6\. Slowly add 500uL of growth media into the/each vial. This will produce a
total of 1mL cell suspension per vial.

7\. Resuspend the cells gently and transfer all contents from the vial to the
bottom of a 50mL falcon tube. *NOTE: Dispensing suspension of cells on the
sides of the tube will risk loss of cells in Step 11.

8\. Add an additional 500uL of growth media to each vial to collect remaining
cells and add into the centrifuge tube. A total of 1.5mL will be in each vial.

9\. Resuspend cells thoroughly and immediately extract 50uL into a
microcentrifuge tube.

10\. Perform cell count (Refer to VSOP-007) from collected sample and use the
Cell Counting Widget (below) to enter data.

11\.  Extract all contents from the centrifuge tube and dispense into the
prepared growth media. Wash the tube with 5-10 mL of the same growth media to
extract remaining cells attached to the tube.  
12\. Transfer the pre-warmed flasks from the 37C incubator into the BSC.  
13\. Add required volume of growth media to each flask, ensuring the entire
surface is coated. Use the 'Bec Drop' to lay down the flasks.``

14\. Transfer and incubate overnight at 37C.
