Process

Each of the cultures listed in the table bellow has 1 well filled. Image each
culture on 10x magnification. While imaging observe for any signs of
contamination.




Observations

Took sample from 7753 to observe the floating cells. added 10uL of cell
suspension into 100uL of PBS and placed in a 96 wp. Observed under the
microscope but found it difficult to see, given that you can only see the
center of the well. Therefore took 10uL of the sample and place on a
hemocytometer. Observed about 3 floating cells in the hemocytometer. In both
96 wp and hemocytometer, the cells were bright white and did not exhibit any
distinct colours under 20x objective.  (Could be imagining it, but when cells
are out of focus, they appear slightly brown and red [really could just be
overly hopeful]. )

Strange large flat  translucent blobs/splatters with a nucleus(?) that has
lots of speckles. (like a fried egg). Surrounding it has no debris.
