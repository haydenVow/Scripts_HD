Aim/Purpose


To adapt F_CHOMP09 cells to suspension using P53i and HDACs


Hypothesis


We hypothesise that HDACs and/or P53i will enable F_CHOMP09 cells to adapt to
suspension


Technical Gap


We have so far been unable to successfully adapt cells to suspension culture.
We have tested HDAC1 and HDAC2 in a past experiment (see here), however those
cultures did not produce any suspension adapted cells. We hypothesise that
that was due to the medium not being supplemented with key growth factors,
such as IGF-1-LR3, b-FGF, and PDGF-BB. The cultures were also grown in 6-well
plates, and thus far we have only seen promising adaptation results in E-125
flasks. While we have tested a P53-inhibitor in adherent cultures (see here),
it has not yet been trialed in suspension cultures.


Method/Procedure


Things to note

  * Cells will be harvested when the flasks reach ~100% confluence, hence being unable to assign a specific day for seeding
  * The two base/control media for this experiment is: 
    1. HyCell CHO + 20% KSR + *5G supplement
    2. CD CHO + 20% KSR + *5G supplement
      * *5G supplement = 1:100 ACA + 4 mM Glutamax + 1xP/S + 100 ng/mL IGF-1-LR3 + 100 ng/mL FGF-b
  * The medium can be prepared ahead of time without KSR, IGF-1-LR3 or FGF-B. When preparing the medium for the experiment, leave 20% of volume free for KSR addition. No need to leave room for growth factors as they account for very little volume. 
  * The 20% KSR and growth factors will be added on the day of feeding directly to media aliquots 
  * The mutagenesis cells will be seeded into CD CHO medium

Experimental Plan  

  1. D0: Thaw 110M F_CHOMP9 cells into 6 x 4CFs in DMEM/F12+20%FBS+1xP/S. 
    * Note: only 3 of the 4CFs will be used for this experiment - the remaining 3 will seed EPIC28843
  2. D3: Perform 50% feed with DMEM/F12 + 20% FBS + 1xP/S (repeat every 3-4 days until close to 100% confluent)
  3. D19: Perform 50% feed with DMEM/F12 + 20% FBS + 1xP/S
  4. D20: (1 day prior to harvesting) Prepare experimental media (need 3500 mL total for seeding and feeds - round up to 3600 mL) 
    1. Prepare base medium without KSR or growth factors
      * Calculations
        1. For seeding: 20 mL x 25 flasks = 500 mL + error (240 mL Hycell CHO, 260 mL CD CHO)
        2. For feeds: (75% feeds, 2 x per week for 30 days = 8 feeds) 15 mL x 25 flasks x 8 = 3000 mL (1440 mL Hycell CHO, 1560 mL CD CHO)
      * Make up 1800 mL basal media for each media type
      *   
  
  
  
  
    2. Prepare HDAC aliquots
      1. Remove HDAC1 and HDAC2 vials from -80'C freezer 
      2. Allow to thaw at RT 
      3. Centrifuge vials and transfer to BSC 
      4. Make up aliquots of following volumes:
        1. HDAC1: 2.42 uL
        2. HDAC2: 11.58 uL 
      5. Place back in -80'C freezer  

  5. D21: (when ~100% confluent) Prepare medium and seed 24 x E-125 flasks with F_CHOMP09 cells and 1 x E-125 flask with mutagenesis cells.
    * Prepare media. Note: see schematic diagrams at bottom of step 5 for visual aid in media prep and seeding setup

      * Aliquot: 195 mL of HyCell CHO and 211 mL CD CHO 
      * Add KSR and growth factors to 2 x aliquots as described in tables below (this will result in 1 x 245 mL aliquot and 1 x 265 mL aliquot)
