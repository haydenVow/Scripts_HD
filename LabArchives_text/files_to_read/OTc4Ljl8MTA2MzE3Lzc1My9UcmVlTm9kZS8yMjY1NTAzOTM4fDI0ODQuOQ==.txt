Process:

1\. Aliquotted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then
placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath for a minimum of 20 minutes
prior to use:

  1.  Growth media (for seeding):   30 mL in  1x 50 mL  tube
  2.  Time that all aliquot was placed in the water bath to warm before use: 15:50 

2\. Collected the cryovial from Liquid Nitrogen storage & place in foam
floater in water bath for 5 min  15:58 - 16:03

Location where cryovial was collected from:

 Brew  

Tower/Bucket # 1  

Box/Cane # 2  

Vial location: A3  

Vial ID(s): 2282-Culture-6303-Vial-3of115  




3\. Ethanol sprayed & transferred the vial(s) to the BSC.

4\. Added 500 µL of Growth Media (to generate a total volume of 1mL in the
cryovial) to the cryovial, resuspended the cell suspension gently to reduce
osmotic shock.

5\. Collected the entire 1mL of cell suspension & transfer into the pre-warmed
tube of Growth Media (prepared in Step 2).




6\. Using a 10mL serological pipette, resuspended & distributed the cells
evenly in the  30 mL of pre-warmed Growth Media (prepared in Step 2).

7\. Seeded cells into (non-gelatin coated) flasks/wells at approximately 7k
cells per cm2.

  1. e.g. 1 million fibroblasts can be seeded into 1 x T175

8\. Transfered  30 mL to each  1x T175  flask.

9\. Transfered flask/plate(s) to incubate at:

  * [x]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (aviary cells)
