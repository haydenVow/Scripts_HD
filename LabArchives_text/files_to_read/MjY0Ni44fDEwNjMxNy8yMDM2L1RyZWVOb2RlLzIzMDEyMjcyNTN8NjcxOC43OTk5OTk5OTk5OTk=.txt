Preparation of stock and and working solutions for CMFDA Cell Tracker

1\. Remove the CMFDA powder from the freezer (main lab) and allow it to warm
to room temperature. Each aliquot is 50 ug.

  1.  Briefly centrifuge the tube to pellet the CMFDA powder

2\. Add 50 uL high-quality, anhydrous DMSO to the powder and pipette up and
down until well suspended. This will yield a 1 mM stock solution.

  1. NOTE - Once prepared, the DMSO stock solution should be stored at -20'C in a 70 mL pot submerged in silica-gel desiccant beads for a short period for one series of experiments. 

3\. Transfer 40 uL of the 1mM CMFDA stock solution to 20 mL of prepared
DMEM/F12 PRF growth media in a light safe 50 mL falcon tube to protect it from
light. Vortex to ensure thorough mixing with the resulting solution being
approximately 2 uM CMFDA working solution.

4\. Prepare a separate 36 mL of DMEM/F12 PRF growth media.

  1.  Transfer both the CMFDA working stock solution and DMEM/F12 PRF growth media into the water bath to be pre-warmed 14:47

5\. Aspirate the media from all the wells both cell seeded and cell free
scaffolds

6\. Add 1 mL of pre-warmed DMEM/F12 PRF growth media to the wells from each
plate as a rinse step to remove any residual serum.

7\. Aspirate the rinsing media from both plates

8\. Add 500 uL of pre-warmed CMFDA working solution to the each well in both
plate and incubate for 30 minutes at 37'C covered in foil to protect samples
from light.

  1. Start/Finish time was:  15:24 - 15:54
  2.  If the CMFDA working solution is no longer required dispose of solution as aqueous waste as aqueous solutions of CMFDA are susceptible to hydrolysis and should be used within one day.

9\. Without changing the media in the wells, image all wells from both plates
on the Zaber fluorescence microscope (channel AF488 for CMFDA [Live cells]).
Remember to image both sides.

10\. Transfer all the scaffolds into a new 48 well plate containing inserts.

10\. Replace all wells with 1 mL fresh media either serum or ACF (according to
the plate map above)

11\. Return both plates to the incubator.

Observations/Summary:

\- A number of scaffolds were quite difficult to flip over between the Zaber
scans due to being quite blobby and forming a small ball

\- Scaffolds were slightly firmer than the previous day

\- After analysing the images following the Zaber scan many scaffolds were out
of focus and thus difficult to determine how confluent the scaffold were with
MuSC- the likely cause of this is that the scaffolds were left in the 500 uL
of staining solution instead of the standard 50 uL which potentially caused
some scaffolds to float and be in a different plane of focus compared to
others.




Results:

  * Results were;
    * [x]  As Usual (this is a repetitive task)
    * [ ]  Unexpected because... it worked
    * [ ]  Need to be further analysed
    * [ ]  Other (.......)
