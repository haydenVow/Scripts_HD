Process
  
  
  1. Removed flasks from incubator 
  2. Took 2 x 550 uL samples from each E-flask
  3. Performed cell counts and averaged for each flask and each condition (recorded in table below)
  4. Aliquoted following volumes of media with growth factors and warmed in water bath to reduce density. Checked table below to see if any cultures require expansion into larger E-flask. 
    1. 90/10: 500 mL + IGF + EGF (topping culutre up to 1000 mL to be split across 2 x E1000s)
    2. 100/0: 30 mL + IGF + EGF (100% feed - still seems to be in adapting phase - keep in E125)
  5. Transferred 100/0 culture to 1 x 50 mL flask
  6. Centrifuged at 500 x g for 5 min
  7. Aspirated 100% of supernatant and resuspended in 30 mL warmed media
  8. Strained culture through 40 um cell strainer into new E-flask
  9. Added 500 mL to 90/10 culture
  10. Strained 90/10 culture through 40 um cell strainer into new E1000 flask then transferred 500 mL back to original E1000 to leave 500 mL in each flask
  11. Returned cultures to incubate at 37'C, 5% CO2, 120 RPM

quite a lot of variation in morphology but don't look too unhealthy. Some
