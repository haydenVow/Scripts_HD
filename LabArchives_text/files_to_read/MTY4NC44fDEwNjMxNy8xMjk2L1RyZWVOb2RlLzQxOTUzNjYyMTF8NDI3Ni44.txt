Primary Antibody Staining

  

Reagent preparation:

Use the following spreadsheet to:

  * Determine the total amount of regent required for primary staining
  * Provide more information on antibody types

gid-1896419-b879a5de34104da8b0c7ed8843f1a7ae)

1\. Prepared  4.5 mL PBST (0.2% Triton-X)

2\. Prepared  4.5 mL blocking buffer: PBST (0.1% Triton-X + PBS) + 3% bovine
serum albumin (BSA). (Kept in the fridge until needed in blocking step)

3\. Prepared Primary Antibody Mix:

  1. 9 µL   Primary #1 TE-7 In house    (1:100  ) +  891  µL Blocking Buffer
  2.  18µL   Primary #1 TE-7 In house    (1:50  ) +  882  µL Blocking Buffer
  3.  9 µL   Primary #2 TE-7 New    (1:100  ) + 891 µL Blocking Buffer  
  
Total volume required =  900 uL

Vortexed antibody mix for 5 seconds and stored refrigerated away from light
until needed.

  

3\. Prepared Primary Antibody Mix (Performed on Tuesday 25 May):

  *  18µL   Primary #3 Anti-Vimentin antibody S# 716    (1:50  ) +  882 µL Blocking Buffer
  *  9 µL   Primary #3 Anti-Vimentin antibody S# 716  (1:100 + Secondary) +  891 µL Blocking Buffer

  

Incubate for 2 hours at room temperature 09:23 - 11:23

Process:

Permeabilise

1\. Removed PBS from each well.

2\. Added 150 µL PBST (0.2% Triton-X) to each well for 15 min:  15:37 - 15:52

3\. Aspirated PBST for each well.




Blocking

1\. Added  150 µL of blocking buffer per well (3% BSA in PBST [0.1% Triton-X])
and incubate for 45 minutes - 1hr at RT. (no more than 1 hour):  16:04 - 16:55




Single Primary Antibody staining

1\. Removed blocking buffer from each well.

2\. Incubated cells with primary antibody overnight at 4'C, parafilmed and
wrapped in foil: 17:11

After this step, all further task should be performed in a dark room. The
vessel should also be wrapped foil when not used.
