Current temperature on data logger:  n / a  
Observations: Please note and signs of leakage, comment on the status of the
ice/gel packs (melted/cold to touch ect). Upon handling the tissue samples
(still inside their container/bag), note whether the tissue samples are cold

# Biopsy Process - Joint dissection & isolation of primary cells (e.g.
chondrocytes, bone cells)

Step 1.  Prepare hood in Yurt laboratory  
12:40pm

  
Step 2: Bringing ex vivo tissue into labs

1.    Obtain package-wrapped chicken carcass from fresh food store - get the latest 'use by' date to ensure best cell recovery. Check that carcass is optimal, i.e. no obvious breaks in packaging or skin, contamination from abattoir, etc.

  

  
2\. Time of chicken limbs arrived at the Vowse 08:58am

  1.  Check that carcass is optimal, i.e. no obvious breaks in packaging or skin, contamination from abattoir, and temperature is still cool to touch.
  2. Take an image of the chicken carcass that the biopsy will be acquired from. 
  3.  Place the sample in a 4C fridge until use.
    * ID of the fridge used: Vowse Kitchen Fridge (Mezzanine) (no ID) 4C  
  

3\. Record Key details (for Ranger):

4\.  Remove sample from fridge  1:11pm

5.    Transfer carcass to the Yurt lab for initial dissection in Class II flow hood.

33ml of digestion media into T75, three T75s in total.

Step 3: Dissection

1.    Place the Chicken limb  in the BSC and follow steps 2 to 11. Then, repeat these steps for each chicken limb, recording the duration of time taken (and the initals of the operator) per chicken limb biopsy. 

  * Chicken 1 limb 1:15- pm  (JH)
  * Chicken 1 limb 2: 13: -14:10 (VB)
  * Chicken 2 limb 1: 14:12 -14:34 (JD)
  * Chicken 2 limb 2: 15:12 - 15:28  (JH)
  * Chicken 3 limb 1: 15: 30-15:50 (VB)
  * Chicken 3 limb 2: 15:52 - 16:06  (VB)

2\. Spray 2x repiwides with 70% ethanol readily to place the chicken on top of
a surface that has resistance during the sectioning stage.  
  
3\. Ethanol spray forceps, extra sterile with anything that touches the
biopsy. Used scissors to break open the packaging of the chicken to reduce the
amount of scalpels used.

4. Spray joint liberally with 70% ethanol and allow to dry so that surface is sterile before cutting.

  * hold with one hand (with an ethanol-sprayed repiwide) so that only one hand is slimy.
  * give it a wiggle to determine where the extraction site is. spray the site and peel back the skin. Spray the muscle prior to cutting in.

5\. Image the site that biopsy will be extracted from. (check jesi's phone)

6.    Open up joint capsule using scalpel and forceps. taking extreme care with surgical grade sharps.  

7\.    Identify the tissue of interest and resect the muscle and skin from
around the area to provide a clean, clear and visible working surface. Note:
This important step eliminates infection risk if done correctly

  * Take image of the expose site that the biopsy will be extracted from. 

8.    Using fresh scalpel and forceps for the sterile dissection, sever ligaments to allow the joint capsule to be explored and open out (like a book) to expose all surfaces to be excised 

  * note insert the scalpel in the joint and 'wiggle' the scapel to cut the internal ligaments and dislodge the joint, to open up the site where the cartilage biopsy fragments will be acquired

9.    Using scalpels, rongeur or biopsy punch as appropriate, remove small pieces of cartilage tissue and place in the prepared collagenase-DMEM T75 flasks

 ~~10\. Weigh the cartilage tissue acquired.~~

  *  ~~  Measured: ~~ ~~  __g~~

10\. Image the articular cartilage shavings

  * Produced from 1x knee and placed in the digestion media-filled T75

11.    Once all usable tissue has been collected, secure cap on flask and place in the incubator at 37C 5% CO2 in UPRIGHT/ vertical position. 14:20  
  
12\.  Dispose of the remainder of the joint appropriately (wrap in plastic
bags, clean up all fragments, tissue fluid and blood) and place bag for
disposal

Step 4 : Collagenase digest & cell recovery

1.    Incubate overnight with vented cap flask upright (not horizontal) at 37C in incubator 14:20 10/05/2022 - 10:18 12/05/2022  

2\. Time the flask was removed from the incubator. 10:18 10/05/2022  

3\. The following morning, agitate digested tissue to dislodge cells by gentle
shaking/swirling

4\. Pour the 100mL of collagenase solution (in 3x T75) equally across 46 50mL
falcon tubes (with 5x 40um cell strainers)

  * Remove the liquid phase using a pipette and pass through a cell sieve into a 50 ml falcon tube

5\. Rinse the 3x T75 flasks with 10mL dPBS (each) and pippette the 30mL of PBS
through the cell strainers, equally across the 6x falcon tubes containing the
cell suspension.  

  * Adding this 30ml PBS aims to dilute the the viscous cell suspension media in the falcon tube - this improves pellet formation and cell recovery.

6\. with 10mL of growth medium in a 10mL serological, collect the remaining
fragements inside the cell strainer and pippette into a T75.

7\. Top up the t75 up to 12mL and place in the incubator 10:43

  * i.e Keep the undigested fragments in the flask - these will be used for explant culture. 

6.    Centrifuge at 400g for 8 minutes 10:-40 - 10:48 1/05/2022 

7\. Re-suspend in 20mL Growth Medium

8\. Aliquot 10uL of growth media and insert into hemocytmeter for a cell count
11:15

  * Total cells: 122,000,000 cells in 12mL 

9\. Seed 12M across 3x T75s , to seed 4M cell per flask.

  *   

10\. Place 3xT75 in the incubator 12:13  

11\. Centrifuge remaining 100M cells a 400g for 8 minutes  12:14 - 12:22

Discard supernatant by gently pouring and re-suspend pellet incomplete, basic
DMEM with 15% antibiotics and 10% FCS. Vit C is optional.

8.    Plate out the cell suspension in 7ml media in a T75 and label. Note: a low volume of media improves cell attachment

9.  Place the T75 in a 37C incubator. . -:--am/pm    

10\.  NOTE: Passage when 70% confluent

Step 5 : Explant culture of undigested fragments

1.    Once all collagenase-containing media is removed from the original digestion flask, add 10ml fresh growth media to the fragments.

2\. Return the T25 flask to the 37C incubator. Place flask in usual
(horizontal) position.  -:--am/pm

2.    Over 48h cells will grow out of the explants to colonise the surrounding flask.

3.    After 48h cells from explants can also be passaged in the normal way. Pass the trypsinized cells+fragments through a cell sieve to collect a cell-only suspension and passage as usual. Discard the remaining fragments
