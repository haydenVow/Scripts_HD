Process:

  1. Aliquoted:
    1.  25 mL  of  DMEM + 10% FBS + 1xP/S  
      * Added 250 uL of "Anti-Clumping Agent" to aliquot 
    2. 10 mL of D/F + 10% FBS + 1xP/S 
      1. Placed in water bath:   11:55     

  2. Collected E125 culture vessel from shakers, wiped with ethanol-sprayed cloth and brought into BSC (if necessary, paused shakers by pressing the "play" button on the controller on the side wall of the incubator)
  3. Using a 5 mL serelogical pipette, gently pipette-mixed culture for ~1 minute to break up cell clumps
  4. Pipetted suspension though 70 um cell strainer into 1 x 50 mL tubes
  5. Centrifuged at 300 x g for 5 min. Timestamp: 10:24 - 10:29  

  6. Aspirated supernatants, taking care to not disrupt or aspirate pellets
  7. Re-suspended cultures in 500 uL of growth media.
  8. Took 1 x 20 uL aliquot and performed cell count, recording counts in this spreadsheet https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1YuTvXJXQQMIMwRZGeqNjdi20WeURg5FpM-1TJ-zrb1c/edit#gid=1104649984
    1. Count: 6000
      * Note: Lot of small pieces of debris seen, very few viable-looking cells
  9. Replaced fresh, warmed media
  10. Gently pipette-mixed cultures again before moving back to E125 flask 
  11. Returned vessel to incubator. If shaker was paused, remembered to press play to restart shaking.    

  12. Incubator (#68), Lab [Main/Library/Production]  
  

  13. Collected spin tube culture vessel from shakers, wiped with ethanol-sprayed cloth and brought into BSC (if necessary, paused shakers by pressing the "play" button on the controller on the side wall of the incubator) 11:11
  14. Centrifuged at 300 x g for 5 min. Timestamp:   

  15. Aspirated supernatant, taking care to not disrupt or aspirate pellet
  16. Re-suspended cultures in 10 mL of warmed growth media.
  17. Gently pipette-mixed cultures again before moving back to spin tube
  18. Returned vessels to incubator. If shaker was paused, remembered to press play to restart shaking. Spin tubes should be shaking at 206 RPM Timestamp:  11:18
