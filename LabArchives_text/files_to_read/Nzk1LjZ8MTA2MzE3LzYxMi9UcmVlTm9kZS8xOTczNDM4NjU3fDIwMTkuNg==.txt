Reagent preparation:

1\. Aliquotted   30  mL  PBS for washing

2\. Centrifuged the secondary antibody stock using the benchtop
microcentrifuge for 10 seconds.

3\. Prepared Secondary Antibody mix:

  5.7 ÂµL   Secondary #1   (1:1000) +  5700  uL Blocking Buffer (PBST (0.1%
Triton X + dPBS) + 3% BSA)  

Vortexed antibody mix for 5 seconds and stored refrigerated away from light
until needed.

4\. Prepared DAPI mix:

 5700  mL  PBS +  5.7  uL  of DAPI

Vortexed DAPI mix and stored refrigerated away from light until needed.

Process:

1\. Removed plate from fridge (incubated in primary antibodies overnight).
2AB: s#1606 pbs 4297, 4490,

2\. Washed 3 times for 5 min with PBS at RT.

 12:17 - 12:22

 12:23 - 12:28  

 12:29 - 12:34

3\. Incubated the cells with secondary antibody mixture in the dark at RT for
1 hour.  12:36 - 13:37  

NOTE: from this step onwards protect from the light by wrapping plates in foil
and perform experiment in the dark.




Counter staining

1\.  Removed 2nd antibody solution.  13:37

2\.  Washed with DAPI (1:1000) in PBS for 5 min at RT in the dark.

 13:40 - 13:45  

3\.  Washed in PBS 2 x 5 min at RT in the dark. (No Triton)

 13:46 - 13:51  

 13:52 - 13:57

4\.  Replaced dPBS.

 13:58

5\. Confirmed staining on microscope by imaging.
