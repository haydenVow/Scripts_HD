Protocol

  1. Check gas pressure at regulator for all gases in use. Ensure pressure is the same, and is between 1-3 bar.
  2. Check alarms in warnings and alerts screen. Dismiss any non-applicable alarms. 
  3. Inspect each physical bioreactor and ensure all clamps are sealed. Check the colour and consistency of the broth (e.g. if milky - contamination, or foamy - cell death)
  4. Inspect the bioreactor specs in the software and note if any parameter is out of spec.

StepSample bioreactor & take offline readings  
Operator nameVP  
Time-stamp3:40PM  
Protocol

  1. Follow on-screen prompts to draw sample from the sampling line: 
    * take 1mL draw and reserve in 50mL falcon tube
    * take 1mL draw and place 0.5mL in eppendorf tube, place remainder in 50mL falcon tube
  2. Cell count 0.5mL in eppendorf tube and record in G-sheet (below)
  3. Return cell suspension from 1.5mL tube to 50mL falcon tube for pH reading
  4. Calibrate pH meter and read values for all samples. Record pH values below

  
  
Deviations & notes

See G-sheet here for offline readings

Online pH was reading within spec. Offline pH showed a lot of drift (e.g.
reading 7.0 online, reading 7.45 offline). Did not readjust offset again, left
reactors to run. Checked control loops and pH base and pH gas loops turned on.
No large variations in pH logged in data logger, but showed relevant changes
(e.g. when reactors borrowed and returned, or when offset was calculated at
start - i.e. the data didnt seem to be dud data feeding into the system).

Action to be taken: contact Andrew from Sartorius about drift
