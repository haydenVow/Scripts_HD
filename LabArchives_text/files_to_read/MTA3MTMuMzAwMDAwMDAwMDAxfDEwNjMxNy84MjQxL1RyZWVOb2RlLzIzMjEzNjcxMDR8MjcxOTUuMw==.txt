### Process:

1\. Inspected wells under the microscope and crossed out those that did not
look viable (in red).




FEEDING:

1\. Clones received an 100% media feed (3mL of media). Media was aspirated and
discarded from each well and replaced with fresh, warmed growth media. Plates
were then returned back to the incubator at 30 degrees, 5% CO2. Incubator 82
in main lab.

2\. 8 clones were passaged:

  1. Aspirated 3mL of waste media.
  2. Washed well with 1mL dPBS/well.
  3. Aspirated 1mL dPBS/well.
  4. Added 1mL of tryple and left in the incubator for 8 minutes.
  5. Transferred 100uL of the trypalised cells directly to a fresh well containing 3mL of growth media, DMEM/F12+20%FBS+1xP/S.


Observations


The cells were left in tryple for over 13 minutes (I set an 8 min timer and
then a 5 min timer) and when I looked at them under the microscope not many of
them had detached.
