 3\. Added the following reagents to the water bath and media to incubator and
warm at 30 and 37°C 12:55

  




Process:  
E-125 flasks (DOLLY ONLY). Due to low cell numbers, CHOMP cultures will be
disposed of. These cultures will only be sampled for imaging on the Zaber.  

  1. Collected E125s from shaker, wiped with ethanol-sprayed Rediwipe, and brought into BSC
  2. Using a 25 mL serelogical pipette, gently pipette-mixed culture for 1 minute to break up cell clumps
  3. Transfer suspension into 50 mL tubes. Kept E125 vessels in BSC, as culture will be returned to this vessel after feed. 
  4. Centrifuged 50 mL tubes at 300 x g for 5 min 13:45-13:50
  5. Aspirated  100% (30 mL) of supernatant, taking extra care to not disrupt or aspirate pellet. 
  6. Added 500 uL of fresh growth media and resuspended pellet using a P1000 pipette.
  7. Sampled 10 uL of culture for manual haemocytometer cell counts
  8. Added  30 mL of fresh, warmed growth media to each 50 mL tube
  9. Took 100 uL samples from each culture and loaded onto a 96 well plate according to the plate map. 
  10. Gently pipette-mixed cultures using serological, before moving cell suspension back to E125s
  11. Returned E125s to incubator 15:02

Trypan blue cell counts

1\. Added 10 uL of trypan blue to each 10 uL sample and counted cells manually
using a haemocytometer.

2\. Recorded cell counts on the Cell Count Spreadsheet

Staining and imaging:  
1\. Prepared dead stain buffer in 15 mL amber or black tube by combining the
following:

  * 2 mL of dPBS 
  * 2 drops of NucGreen Dead Af488 stain
    * Vortex mix for ~5 seconds, then stored in dark until ready to use.

2\. Prepared live stain solution in 15 mL black tube by combining the
following:

  * 4750 uL MilliQ
  * 250 uL Hoechst Trichloride trihydrate solution (1 mg/mL)
    * Vortex mix for ~5 seconds, then stored in dark until ready to use.

  1. Added 20 uL live stain solution directly to cells
  2. Added 80 uL of dead stain solution directly to cells
  3. Incubated for 30 minutes in the dark at room temperature Timestamp: 15:32
  4. Made 25% and 12.5% dilutions of the sample in dPBS   

  5. Centrifuged plates at 300 RCF for 1 minute  15:35-15:36
  6. Plate ID: 9242

Observations/Summary  
Zaber observations  
CHOMP cultures 9108, 9109 will be disposed of due to low cell counts.




Culture disposal

Due to low cell counts and to free incubator space, all CHOMP cultures were
disposed of.
