Performed by: Bonnie  




Media/Reagents used:

NameDetails  
Growth/Proliferation Media A7448  
  
  
  




Note: Due to the large amount of debris seen across all cultures, they were
given a 100% feed today.




Growth Media:

  * [x]  DMEM/F12 + 10% FBS + 1X P/S




Observations

All cultures were examined under the microscope. When adherent cells were
observed, images were taken. See mia links below.

Culture  
Observations  
  
8717-F_WALLE02-Bennets Wallaby P1-1of1  
Larger clusters of cells observed compared to on 25/10. Very low confluence,
estimated 10%. A lot of debris present.  
  
8716-F_WALLE04-Bennets Wallaby P2-1of1  
No distinct change since last observation on 25/10. Very low confluence,
estimated <10%. A lot of debris present.  
  
8532-F_WALLE02-Bennets Wallaby P1-1of1  
No distinct change since last observation on 25/10. Some areas up to 70%
confluent while others are more sparse. A lot of debris present.
