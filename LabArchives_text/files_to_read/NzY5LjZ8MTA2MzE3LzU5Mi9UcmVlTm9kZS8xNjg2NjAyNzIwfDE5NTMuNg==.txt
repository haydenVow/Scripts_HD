Aim/Purpose: To assess the feasibility of the ELISA pipeline in measuring a baseline for maturation
Hypothesis: ELISA is a viable and better alternative for measuring maturation in C2C12 cells in comparison to lone immunofluoresence imaging.
Technical Gap: We currently do not have a quantitative measure for maturation in our cells.
Method/Procedure


Background:

As of the 5th of June, we have WCBs of C2C12 cells ready for use in Vow's R&D
experiments.They are an ideal cell type for maturation assays as they
differentiate and mature within 5 days in differentiation media. Hence, for
this EPIC - C2C12s will be seeded and matured at different densities to test
the feasibility of the ELISA pipeline.

Each column of a 96 well plate will contain a steadily increasing
concentration of seeded cells. Starting at a baseline of 0 cells in Column 3,
we expect no signal from this column and hence will be used as a blank. The
edges (2 column barrier) will be filled with PBS to minimise edge effects that
is often seen in 96 well plate assays. As seen in the figure below, the seed
density of cells gradually increases until 7000 cells/well - which would be
considered "confluency" in a well of this nature. By "ramping" the cell
density we can compare between wells:

\- The Janus Green absorbance

\- The ELISA absorbance

Hence, we can see if a "ramping" effect is also seen in our quantitative data
obtained from the plate reader and determine if the data is as expected or
not.
