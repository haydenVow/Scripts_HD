### Process for Passage:

  1. Took image of vessel with microscope on phase setting and determined if cultures should be passaged for given a 50% feed (see notes in table)
  2. Aliquoted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath for a minimum of 20 minutes prior to use
  3. Removed vessel(s) from the incubator
  4. Washed the vessel(s) with dPBS (warmed).
  5. Added    10    mL tryple to each vessel/well and incubated at 37˚C for 10min.
  6. Neutralised with    10      dPBS and combined cell suspension into      50ml   tubes.
  7. Centrifuged at 650 x g for 5 min.
  8. Aspirated the supernatant(s).
  9. Resuspended pellet(s) in      300 mL/tube   OptiPro + 4mM Glutamax  medias, then transferred to 2CF  

  10. Re-seeded 3 x T175 for each culture, 30mL per vessel.   

  11. Transferred vessel(s) to incubate:   
37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
