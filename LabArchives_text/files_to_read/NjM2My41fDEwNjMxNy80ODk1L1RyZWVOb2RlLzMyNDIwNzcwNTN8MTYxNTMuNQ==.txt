## Reagent Prep

Live staining with CMFDA: SEE GUIDE ON CMFDA STAINING HERE  

Preparation of stock and and working solutions for CMFDA Cell Tracker

1\. Remove the CMFDA powder from the freezer (main lab) and allow it to warm
to room temperature. Each aliquot is 50 ug.

  1.  Briefly centrifuge the tube to pellet the CMFDA powder

2\. Add 50 uL high-quality, anhydrous DMSO to the powder and pipette up and
down until well suspended. This will yield a 1 mM CFDA stock solution.

  1. NOTE - Once prepared, the DMSO stock solution should be stored at -20'C in a 70 mL pot submerged in silica-gel desiccant beads for a short period for one series of experiments. If a large amount of stock solution is left, then any remaining solution should be aliquoted and frozen at < \- 20°C. Avoid repeated freeze-thaw cycles, and protect from light. 




Sample selection:

  1. Image/photograph main sample plate to record muscle ring migration and gel contraction (if any)
  2. Select one sample from each condition to be sacrificed and slice sample in half using sterile tweezers/scalpel.
    1. NOTE: Use only half of the no-insert controls and leave the other half in fresh media to continue study. First half is divided into 1/4 samples for staining
  3. Transfer half of each sample into a new plate with 4% PFA and fix using below protocol
    1. Fixing protocol ( ~ 1.20 - 2.30 hr)
      1.  Prepare 
        1. 0.1% PFA - 0.6mL of 4%PFA in 24mL of PBS  

        2. 50 mL of ice cold PBS
      2. Removed media from each well and wash with 1000 ul PBS.
        1. 13:15- 13:22
        2. 13:23 - :13-28  

      3.  Added  1000 uL µL PFA for 1 - 2 hours  in the fridge (1 hr for small loops, 2 hrs if the loop is >5mm in diameter) :  
        1. Small pieces:  13:45 - 15:00 pm
      4. Removed PFA (and add in PFA waste container) and wash wells 3 times with   500 µL of ice cold PBS
      5. Add 0.5 mL PBS into each well
      6. Parafilm plate and place in the fridge.
  4. Treat the other half of each sample with CMFDA as described below.
  5. Transfer all remaining scaffolds into a new plate preloaded with fresh pre warmed E6 growth media (see feed)
  6. Return plates to the incubator.




## CMFDA protocol

  1. ## Aliquot     20    mL PBS or DMEM/F12 for washing the samples and place in waterbath    12:03   . (This is only necessary for samples containing serum as serum interferes with the CMFDA stain)

  2. Transfer     36    uL of the 1mM CMFDA stock solution to     18    mL of prepared DMEM/F12 PRF growth media (m6460) in a light safe falcon tube to protect it from light. 
  3. Vortex to ensure thorough mixing with the resulting solution being approximately 2 uM CMFDA working solution. (2uL of 1mM CMFDA stock solution: 1mL of D/F media.)
  4. Place in the water bath to be pre-warmed        

  5. Add     1    mL of pre-warmed DMEM/F12 PRF growth media to the wells from each plate as a rinse step to remove any residual serum.
  6. Aspirate the rinsing media 
  7. Add    1     mL of pre-warmed CMFDA working solution to the samples and incubate for 30 minutes at 37'C covered in foil to protect samples from light.
    1. Start/Finish time was:   13:21 - 13:51  

    2. If the CMFDA working solution is no longer required dispose of solution as aqueous waste as aqueous solutions of CMFDA are susceptible to hydrolysis and should be used within one day.
  8. Remove    1000     uL of staining solution from each well
  9. Image all wells from plates on the Zaber fluorescence microscope or AXIO (channel AF488 for CMFDA [Live cells]). Remember to image both sides. 
    1. Alternatively, image representative areas on the Axio at relevant magnification




Observations/Summary:

some fluorescence detected under Axio at 20x mag,but hard to detect due to gel
thickness and insufficient light intensity. Cells look round, unlike in Fibrin
gels, suggesting they are not very comfortable in Alginate even at high
density
