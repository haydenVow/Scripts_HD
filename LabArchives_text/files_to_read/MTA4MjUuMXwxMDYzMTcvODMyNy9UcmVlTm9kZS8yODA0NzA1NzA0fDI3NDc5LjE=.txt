Process

  1. Inspected bioreactors for media colour and foam
  2. Inspected culture parameters in graph on screen in AMBR software, including dO, pH, temperature, agitation over time
  3. Sample 2mL from bioreactors:
    * drew 1mL to purge line and dispensed into 50mL falcon tube
    * drew 1mL and dispensed 0.5mL into 1.5mL tube and dispensed the remainder into 50mL falcon tube. x1 50mL falcon tube per reactor and x1 1.5mL tube per reactor  

4\. Counted cells using haemocytometer

 ~~5\. Tested pH using pH meter~~

  

Notes and variations:

  * did not perform offline pH testing due to visible contamination
  * disposed of vessels into clinical waste bin and cleaned AMBR hardware using EtOH soaked wipes

  

  




Observations

  1. Inspected bioreactors
    * media physically milky in appearance indicative of contamination
  2. Inspected pH/dO/temp/agitation graph over time for each reactor
    * graphs show rapid depletion of dissolved oxygen overnight within 3-4 hours - indicative of rapid bacterial growth
  3. Samples inspected under microscope in haemocytometer showed visible signs of bacterial contamination




Sampling and offline measurements

  1. Labelled x4 50mL falcon tubes 1-4
  2. Followed on-screen prompt to sample bioreactors and recorded in run
  3. Sprayed sample line with EtOH and removed cap
  4. Unclipped clamp on sample line
  5. Opened disposable 5mL syringe with luer-lock and drew 1mL, deposited into 50mL tube. Discarded syringe
  6. Opened disposable 5mL syringe with luer-lock and drew 1mL, deposited 0.5mL into 1.5mL tube (for cell count) and deposited remainder into corresponding 50mL tube. Discarded syringe
  7. Clipped sample line and screwed on cap
  8. Repeated for each AMBR bioreactor vessel
  9. Counted cells using Nucleocounter as per manufacturer's instruction. Used 200uL sample volume per read. 
  10. Deposited remaining cell suspension from 1.5mL tube into corresponding 50mL falcon tube and used offline pH probe (Matteo Toledo) as per manufacturer's instruction and recorded
