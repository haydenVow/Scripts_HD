Aim/Purpose


To generate a population of crocodile fibroblasts treated with UV-irradiation
and a P53-inhibitor to be seeded into suspension culture


Hypothesis


We hypothesise that a high percentage of cells exposed to UV irradiation will
enter apoptosis, however the presence of a P53 inhibitor will protect
sufficient numbers to then be expanded for seeding into suspension culture


Technical Gap


Producing a fibroblast clone that is able to maintain proliferative capacity
longterm is vital to produce large quantities of consistent cell mass. In
order to continue growing beyond the Hayflick limit, a cell must undergo
mutation. This can happen randomly as a result of DNA replication errors, or
can be induced through environmental conditions such as UV exposure. We have
identified levels of UV-irradiation which resulted in a ~95% cell death rate
(300 mj/cm2), and concentrations of P53i that do not impact cell growth (10-30
uM). In this experiment we will expose cells to UV-irradiation in the presence
of a P53 inhibitor to cause DNA mutations without resulting in >95% cell
apoptosis.


Method/Procedure


Stage 1: Mutagenesis

  1. Thaw 2 x vials of CHOMP fibroblasts (4 M cells total) into 7 x 100 mm plates in DMEM/F12 + 20% FBS + 1xP/S. 24H after seeding, proceed with UV treatment.
  2. Assign and label each plate to a condition as listed below:

    1. Condition 1: 10 uM P53i, 300 mj/cm2 UV

    2. Condition 2: 10 uM P53i, 150 mj/cm2 UV

    3. Condition 3: 30 uM P53i, 300 mj/cm2 UV
    4. Condition 4: 30 uM P53i, 150 mj/cm2 UV

    5. Control 1: 0 uM P53i, 300 mj/cm2 UV

    6. Control 2: 30 uM P53i, 0 mj/cm2 UV 

    7. Control 3: 0 uM P53i, 0 mj/cm2 UV

  3. Prepare media aliquots and reagents 

    1. 20 mL x  dPBS + 40 uL P53i (10 uM)

    2. 30 mL x  dPBS + 60 uL P53i (180 uM)

    3. 10 mL x  dPBS (no P53i) 

    4. 70 mL x growth medium + 100 ng/mL IGF-1 and FGF-B 

  4. Set up UV lamp inside BSC clamped in retort stand.  

  5. Bring "Condition 1" plate into BSC. Remove growth medium and wash with 5 mL dPBS. Replace with 10 mL dPBS + 10 uM P53i.  

  6. Place on ice block

  7. Place plate under lamp (~10 cm from bulb) and turn on light. 

  8. Remove plate after 12.5 min (300 mj/cm^2).

  9. Replace dPBS with fresh, warmed growth medium + 100 ng/mL FGF-B and IGF-2  

  10. Repeat steps 5-9 for conditions 2-6 with P53i and UV levels as listed in table below. For "Condition 6", leave cells in dPBS + P53i for 12.5 minutes before replacing with growth medium. For "Condition 7" plate, simply perform a 100% feed with growth medium + 100 ng/mL IGF-1 and FGF-B.

Stage 2: monitoring & expansion

  11. Image cells and record observations. Passage and feed when needed to expand for seeding into suspension culture.
