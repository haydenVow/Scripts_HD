RELATED TO MILESTONE:  Milestone 1B: Have the first biomaterials DOE designed
and underway.

AIM/PURPOSE:

  1. To assess survival of DOLLY12 cells over a 7 day culture period after Hoechst staining.    
  2. To assess survival of DOLLY12 cells a 7 day culture period after Dapi staining.    

HYPOTHESIS:

  1. 7 days after staining, DOLLY12 cells stained with Hoechst will have a survival rate equal to that of unstained cells.    Hoechst/dapi staining will have no effect on cell survival.   

  2. 7 days after staining, DOLLY12 cells stained with Dapi will have a survival rate equal to that of unstained cells. Hoechst/dapi will have no effect on cell survival.

RESULTS SUMMARY: See Report

CONCLUSIONS: After 7 days in culture, DOLLY12 cell morphology and confluence
was no different in cells stained dapi or Hoechst compared to that of
unstained cells. These results indicate that Dapi and Hoechst staining are
suitable for use in DOLLY12 cells intended for continued culture.

NEXT STEPS:

  1. Future studies should aim to optimise Dapi staining protocols to ensure visible differentiation between live and dead cells. Alternative viability stains such as calcein/propidium iodine could also be investigated. 
  2. To reduce possible cytotoxic effects, both Dapi and Hoechst staining protocols should also be optimised with a view to minimising staining concentrations and staining incubation times. 
  3.  Replicate and optimise this experiment using cell seeded scaffolds such as zein, as scaffold are likely to be used throughout our DOEs.
