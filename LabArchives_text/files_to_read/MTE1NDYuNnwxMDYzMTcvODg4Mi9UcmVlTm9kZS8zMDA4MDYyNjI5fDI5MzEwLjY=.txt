Setup Method


Tissue disc trialling

Before Monday July 11, volume and embedding method needs to be assessed.

Volume of the tissue discs in 25mL. Tissue discs do sit flush with plate, but
for security and to ensure tissue gel doesn't get stuck underneath disc, the
discs have been embedded in PDMS (as with the moulds).

Briefly, 9mL of PDMS was placed in the centre of 150mm dishes. Using the
vacuum spin coater, plates were spin coated for ~5 seconds to ensure complete
coverage of the dish. Tissue discs we embedded in PDMS and dishes were placed
in the oven at 65degs for 1 hour. After PDMS was set, dishes were placed into
70% Ethanol.
