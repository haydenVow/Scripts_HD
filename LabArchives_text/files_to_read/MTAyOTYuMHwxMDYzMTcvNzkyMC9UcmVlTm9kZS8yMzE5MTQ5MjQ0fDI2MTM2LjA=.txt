Process
  
  
  1. Prepared 15 mL of Freestyle 293 Nuvonis suspension medium with growth factors added (IGF & EGF) in 1 x 50 mL shake tube with filtered lid

  2. Equilibrated the medium from 11:30 - 14:33 in an incubator at 37°C, 5% CO2, 95% relative humidity.

  3. Selected vial to thaw:  
Dewar Name: Brew  
Frozen Culture IDs: 14014  
Tower # 5 Box # 5  
Position E8

  4. After media equilibration, moved the shake tube containing media into the BSC just before thawing the cells. 

  5. Quickly thawed one vial of Nuvonis quail suspension cells in the 37°C water bath.

    1. Do not immerse the vial completely, only about 2/3, to ensure the top of vial is kept out of the water
    2. Take care to remove the vial from the water bath immediately when the cells are just thawed. Ideally, a small ice clump (approximately 5 mm) is still visible.
  6. Dry wiped the tube.

  7. Wet a wipe with disinfectant (e.g., 70% ethanol), wiped the tube and transferred it into a BSC

  8. Tapped the vial gently to detach the cell pellet, and transferred the cells into an empty 50 mL centrifuge tube by using a pipette equipped with a 1 mL filter tip. Note: Do not mix the cells in the vial by pipetting.

  9. Drop-wise added 1 mL equilibrated medium (from the 7 mL) to the cells and swirled the tube gently for 10 seconds. Incubate cells for one minute

  10. Repeated the last step with 2 mL medium and then with 4 mL medium.

  11. Homogenised the cell suspension by inverting the tube several times and sample 100 μl for a cell count. Transferred the cells into the T75 flask.

  12. Tilt the flask several times to evenly distribute the cells, making sure no liquid enters the neck of the flask and wet the filter, which can potentially compromise the sterility of the vessel.

  13. To count the cells and to assess cell viability, mix the cell sample with trypan blue to a 1:1 ratio (i.e., 20 μl cell sample : 20 μl trypan blue) in a 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube. Add 10 μl to two chambers of a Neubauer improved haemocytometer slide. Counted the cells twice and recorded the total number of cells and the number of viable cells.

    1. Average live cell count: 5,760,000

  14. Incubate the flask at 37°C, 5% CO2, 95% relative humidity (static)
