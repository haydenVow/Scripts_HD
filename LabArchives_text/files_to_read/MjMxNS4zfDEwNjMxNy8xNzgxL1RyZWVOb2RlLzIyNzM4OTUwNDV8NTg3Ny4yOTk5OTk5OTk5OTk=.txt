Interaction effects \- what combination of media, wetness, seeding density and
scaffold results in the highest scaffold confluence by day 14.  

  
Data entered into table - Condition and Confluence only, zein and gelatin in
same data set, serum controls included

Key findings:  
  
\- ANOVA with post-hoc Tukey reported no significant difference between means
for all conditions (post-hoc T-test reported that Z, Wet, 2 condition was
significantly lower, matching the sorted parameter estimates)

  

  

  

  




Interaction effects on Gelatin only - i.e. how does wetness, seeding density
and media type combined influence gelatin scaffold confluence.

Output for with and without serum ctrls included.  
  
Data in table = Gelatin scaffolds only, condition and confluence.

Key findings:

\- Seeding density, scaffold wetness and seeding media type had no significant
difference on scaffold confluence, with no significant difference observed
between conditions.

  

  

  




Data in table = Zein scaffolds only, condition and confluence, serum controls
included.  
  
Interaction effects on Zein only - i.e. how does wetness, seeding density and
media type combined influence zein scaffold confluence.  
  
 Key findings:

  
No significant differences between conditions.

Z, Dry, 0.7 close to having a significant positive effect (p=0.0642)  

  

.

  




Main effects - does seeding density, wetness and media type have an overall
effect (positive or negative) on scaffold confluence regardless of scaffold
material (i.e. when trying a new scaffold is there a blanket condition that is
typically better overall for achieving high confluence).

  
Data in table: Confluence, Scaffold, Wetness, Seeding density, serum controls  
  
Key findings:  
Wetness, Seeding density, and Media had no significant overall effect on
confluence when both scaffold types were compared.  
  
Gelatin was close to having a significantly higher confluence than zein (p =
0.0583)
