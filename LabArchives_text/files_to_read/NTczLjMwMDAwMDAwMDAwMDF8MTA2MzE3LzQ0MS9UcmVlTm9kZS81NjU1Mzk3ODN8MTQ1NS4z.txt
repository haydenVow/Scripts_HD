Original Plate (96-well plate) - (Note scaffolds in wells with Black outlines
would have been used for Fix & DAPI)

  

  

  

New Plate (24-well plate):

  

Process:

D1 calculate seeding efficiency (tryplisation and count from base of wells,
subtracted from initial seed density)

  

  1. Once 1 sample has been taken from each condition for Fix & DAPI staining, and the remaining samples have been moved to 24-well plate, proceed.

Note* Perform this on wells C3-C8 & D3-D8 (old plate).

  

1\. Aspirate growth media from wells C3-C8 and D3-D8.

2\. Wash each well with 100uL/well dPBS.

3\. Aspirate dPBS.

4\. Add 50uL/well of 1X Tryple to wells C3-C8 & D3-D8.

5\. Incubate at 37ÂºC, 5% CO2 for 10-15 min or until all samples have detached.

  1. Start/Finish time for tryple:  16:48 - 17:03  

6\. Combine all cell suspensions from each set of 6 x samples (2 mixtures
total).

(i.e. combine cells from wells in Row C into 1 sample. Combine all cell
suspension from wells in Row D into 1 sample.)

7\. Add 200uL of dPBS to THE FIRST well of each condition (C3 & D3) and use it
to wash all 6 wells horizontally and combine all cell suspensions from each
set of 6 x samples into the existing 2 mixtures total. (C3-C8 into sample
without LAA2P & D3-D8 into sample with LAA2P)

8\. You will have 2 x 500uL suspensions (1 from fibroblast cells with Vitamin
C and 1 from cells without Vitamin C)

9\. Collect 10uL samples from each condition and dilute 1:1 with trypan blue.

10\. Perform a cell count on the hemocytoemter for each cell sample and
discard remaining cells.

  1. Count 1 (Fibroblasts only):  130,000   

  2. Count 2 (Fibroblasts + Vitamin C):  122,000   

11\. Calculate the seeding efficiency from total cells seeded to cells
remaining on base of plate.

Based on Seeding 560K cells per scaffold.

Fibroblast only: ~96%

Fibroblast + Vitamin C: ~96%
