  4. Filter cell suspension through 50 um nylon gauze cell strainer (removes mature oocytes) 12:44
  5. Washed 50 mL tube containing homogenate with 20 mL ASW and passed wash through the same 50 um nylon gauze cell strainer.
  6. Topped up total volume of filtrate to 50 mL with ASW (15 mL) 13:08
  7. Transferred half of strained cell suspension to a second 50 mL tube  

  8. Centrifuged at 300x g for 6 minutes at 15 °C 13:11-13:16
  9. Resuspend each pellet into 36 mL of each growth medium. 
  10. Transferred 3 mL of cell suspension to 3xwells on each coated 6-well plate (Refer to the below table for medium and plate coating variables)
  11. Parafilm plates and incubate at 17C. 14:10
  12. 50% feed every 2 days.

Step 1. Take collection media with biopsy into the BSC.

Step 2. Wash with ASW.

Step 3. Section into 4 pieces using a scalpel.

   : a/pm    : a/pm    : a/pm    : a/pm  
  
Step 4. Transfer to 50mL tubes and incubate gonad tissue pieces in collagenase
(0.5mg/mL) dissolved in  ASW, stirred for 1 hour.

    : a/pm    : a/pm    : a/pm    : a/pm  
  
Step 5. Break tissue apart by mincing with a pair of scalpels in a 100mm dish,
using ASW to ensure the tissue does not dry out.

If the tissue is well digested, triturate through a 10mL serological pipette.

If there are still chunks, using a 10ml syringe and 20-gauge needle, aspirate
and eject the suspension in and out of the syringe 10x.

CRITICAL STEP: The needle may be clogged by small pieces of tissue during the
first few attempts. If clogging occurs during trituration, remove the clog
from the tip of the needle. If clogging occurs during ejection, pull the
plunger up and down to move the clog out of position. Eject towards the wall
of the tube (as opposed to the bottom) to avoid foaming.

Step 6. Filter cell suspension through 50 um nylon gauze cell stainer (removes
mature oocytes)  
Add 10 mL WM to the original tube. Swirl to rinse, and transfer to the same
cell strainer.

Rinse the cell strainer with another 10 mL WM. Use a 20-200 μl pipet to
collect any remaining liquid on the underside of the strainer. CRITICAL STEP:
Make sure to collect everything that remains associated with the outside and
underside of the strainer after filtration to maximize yield.

Remove all supernatant by aspiration immediately after centrifugation as the
pellet will loosen over time. Be very careful not to aspirate cells from the
pellet.  
  
  
  
  
  
  
Step 8. Resuspend one of the 4 homogenates from this biopsy into 3mL of ASW.
