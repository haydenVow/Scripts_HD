Vow's goal is to manufacture it's first ever commercial product using
crocodile fibroblast paste as a key ingredient. It is therefore important to
adapt crocodile fibroblast cells to suspension, so that culture of these cells
can be scaled-up to commercially-useful volumes (in the 100-1000 L range) by
the end of 2022. Previous experiments have demonstrated that the following
conditions are adequate for adherent proliferation of crocodile fibroblasts:

ParameterValueCommentReference  
Temperature (degrees Celsius)30Two temperatures were tested, 30 deg C and 37
deg C; proliferation was suppressed at 37 deg C.EPIC23083  
Atmospheric CO2 concentration (%)5This is the standard CO2 enrichment used in
incubators at Vow.EPIC23083  
Growth mediumDMEM/F12 + 20% FBSTwo FBS concentrations were tested, 10% and
20%; proliferation was suppressed at 10%.EPIC23083  
Osmolality (mOsm/kg)~300Inferred from growth medium

All crocodilians studied to date, from both fresh and salt water, maintain
their plasma osmolality in the range  280-340  mOsm/kg,  with Na and Cl as the
principal  osmolytes. Interspecific  variability is small.

However, a previous experiment (EPIC25749) showed that the medium mix that was
useful for adapting DOLLY12 fibroblasts to suspension from DMEM/F12 + 10% FBS
medium was not adequate for CHOMP09 fibroblasts. A screening experiment is
necessary to determine an adequate medium for suspension adaptation of CHOMP09
fibroblasts. The two options for screening experiments are:

  1. A "Design of Experiment" (DoE) screening design, such as the "definitive screening design" (DSD), that enables screening of several parameters by reducing the levels or options in each parameter to 2 or 3 each;
  2. A "one-variable-at-a-time" (OVAT) design, where many levels or options of a single parameter are tested.

A previous experiment (EPIC22586) demonstrated that basal medium was possibly
the most important medium parameter determining the success of suspension
adaptation; therefore, an OVAT design testing many different basal media was
chosen for this experiment.

As serum concentrations above 2% are known to inhibit suspension adaptation,
and our product should ideally be animal-component free (for ethical and cost-
minimization reasons), the basal media should be supplemented with animal-free
components that mimic those found in FBS but also enhance adaptation to
suspension:

  * Amino acids
  * Vitamins
  * Trace elements
  * Fatty acids and other lipid precursors 
  * Growth factors
  * Shear-protectants
  * Adhesion inhibitors

Therefore, the following supplements were added to all basal media except for
the serum controls:

  1. Knockout Serum Replacement (KSR) at 20% v/v, which is at the upper limit of the typical addition rate, contains mainly amino acids, vitamins and trace elements
  2. Glutamax at 1% v/v, which is the recommended addition rate, is a stable and non-toxic glutamine supplement
  3. Chemically defined lipid concentrate at 0.1% v/v, which is at the lower limit of the typical addition rate, contains fatty acids and cholesterol
  4. FGF, IGF, PDGF at 100 ng/mL, which is the standard addition rate used at Vow, are growth factors that the literature has revealed to be the most important for serum-free growth media
  5. Poloxamer 188 at 1 g/L, which is the recommended addition rate, is the industry-standard shear protectant
  6. Anti-clumping agent at 1% v/v, which is the recommended addition rate, is a common agent to prevent formation of cell aggregates
  7. RGD and YIGSR peptides at 100 ng/mL, are commonly used to inhibit attachment of cells to any surface
