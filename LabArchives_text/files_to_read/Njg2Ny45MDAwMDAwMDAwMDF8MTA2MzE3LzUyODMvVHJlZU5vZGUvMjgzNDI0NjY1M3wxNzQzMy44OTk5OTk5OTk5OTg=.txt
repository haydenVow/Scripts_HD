  * No homogenate was frozen, instead the entire homogenate from a single biopsy was placed into homogenate. 
  * We were unable to establish an adherent population of cells via immediate culture of WALLE crude homogenate.
  * We were unable to expand our cultures to an MCB of â‰¥ 15M cells as we did not successfully establish a population of plastic adherent cells. 

Summary  
After thawing the frozen sample in the fridge overnight, 1 biopsy was
collected from the vastus femoris and processed following Vows standard
protocol for the isolation of primary cells from muscle tissue. The entirety
of the isolate was then placed in immediate culture. When observed under the
microscope, crude homogenate contained mostly debris, with very few healthy
looking spheroid cells. after 4 days this culture was terminated due to the
apparent lack of attachment and elongation of cells onto the culture vessel.
