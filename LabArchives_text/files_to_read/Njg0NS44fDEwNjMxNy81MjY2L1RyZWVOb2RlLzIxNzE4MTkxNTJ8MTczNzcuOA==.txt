Reagent preparation:

1\. Centrifuged the secondary antibody stock using the benchtop
microcentrifuge for 10 seconds.

2\. Prepared Secondary Antibody mix (pipette from the top/supernatant of
antibody solution):

  7 µL   Secondary #1   (1: 1000 ) +  7 µL   Secondary #2   (1: 1000 ) +  7
mL Blocking Buffer (PBST (0.1% Triton X + dPBS) + 3% BSA)  

If using AlexaFluor secondary antibodies then the max concentration should be
1:500 (typically used at 1:1000)

Pipette-mixed antibody mix and stored refrigerated away from light until
needed.

3\. Prepared DAPI mix:

  7 mL  PBS +   7 uL  of DAPI (1:1000)

Vortexed DAPI mix and stored refrigerated away from light until needed.

  

Number of wells for the 12wps = 15

2 mL PBS per well per wash

Number of washes before adding SAb = 3

Number of washes after adding DAPI = 3

Top up with PBS = 1

Total volume of PBS required: 15 x 7 x 2 mL = 210 mL (for the 12wps)

  

Secondary staining with Ab (2 x 1:1000 dilution)  

400 uL of SAb per well for 12wp

7 mL / 1000 = 7 uL of each secondary Ab + DAPI required

7 mL of BB required to dilute both SAbs

7 mL of PBS required to dilute DAPI

Process:

1\. Removed plate from fridge (incubated in primary antibodies overnight).

2\. Washed 3 times for 5 min with PBS at RT.

11:05 - 11:14 - 11:23  a/pm (8822)

11:10 - 11:18 - 11:27  a/pm (8823)

3\. Incubated the cells with secondary antibody mixture in the dark at RT for
1 hour.

11:34 - : a/pm (8822)

11:38 - : a/pm (8823)

NOTE: from this step onwards protect from the light by wrapping plates in foil
and perform experiment in the dark.




Counter staining

1\.  Removed 2nd antibody solution.

13:18 a/pm (8822)

13:23 a/pm (8823)

2\.  Washed with DAPI (1:1000) in PBS for 5 min at RT in the dark.

13:20 - :  a/pm (8822)

13:25 - :  a/pm (8823)

3\.  Washed in PBS 3 x 5 min at RT in the dark. (No Triton)

13:30 - 13:38 - 13:49  a/pm (8822)

13:34 - 13:42 - 13:56  a/pm (8823)

4\.  Replaced dPBS.

14:01 a/pm (8822)

14:06 a/pm (8823)

5\. Confirmed staining on microscope by imaging.
