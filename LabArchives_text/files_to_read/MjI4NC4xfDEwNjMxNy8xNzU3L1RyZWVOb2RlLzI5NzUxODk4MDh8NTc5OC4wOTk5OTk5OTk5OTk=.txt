Calibrated dissolved oxygen probe

  1.  ~~Ran the calibration routine as per the operating manual~~
    1.  ~~Sparged nitrogen gas at high flow rate and with high impeller speed until dissolved oxygen reading equilibrated at a very low level.~~
    2.  ~~Set that level as 0%~~
    3.  ~~Sparged air at high flow rate and with high impeller speed until dissolved oxygen reading equilibrated at a high level.~~
    4.  ~~Set that level as 100%~~ ~~~~

Set level probe

  1.  ~~Loosened the nut around the antifoam/level probe.~~
  2.  ~~Gently rotated and pulled the probe out until it reached the desired height.~~
  3.  ~~Tightened the nut until finger tight.~~ ~~~~

Seeded the batch

  

42 million cells were seeded into the Biostat from a cell expansion harvest:

  1. Thoroughly wiped down the seed bottle and corresponding line from the bioreoactor with 70% ethanol.
  2. Placed the seed bottle and the end of the seed line in the BSC next to the bioreactor.
  3. Aseptically transferred the seed cells to the seed bottle.
  4. Make an aseptic connection between the bottle and the bioreactor seed line.
  5. Pumped the seed cells into the bioreactor.

 ~~Set intermittent stirring schedule for microcarrier culture~~

  1.  ~~Open the "STIRR" menu~~
  2.  ~~Open the "PROFILE" sub-menu~~
  3.  ~~Set intermittent stirring for 2 minutes after 30 minutes~~
    1.  ~~Set a timepoint for 000:00:00 with 0 RPM pump output.~~
    2.  ~~Set a timepoint for 000:30:00 with 0 RPM.  
~~

    3.  ~~Set a timepoint for 000:30:01 with 90 RPM.~~
    4.  ~~Set a timepoint for 000:32:00 with 90 RPM.~~
    5.  ~~Set a timepoint for 000:32:01 with 0 RPM.~~
  4.  ~~Set intermittent stirring for 2 minutes after 60 minutes  ~~
    1.  ~~S et a timepoint for 001:00:00 with 0 RPM.~~
    2.  ~~Set a timepoint for 001:00:01 with 90 RPM.~~
    3.  ~~Set a timepoint for 001:02:00 with 90 RPM.~~
    4.  ~~Set a timepoint for 001:02:01 with 0 RPM.~~
  5.  ~~Continue setting for other timepoints  
~~

    1.  ~~The maximum number of profile points is 32, so intermittent stirring can only be set for up to 4 hours using a square wave speed profile.  
The speed in the first profile should be 0. If the speed in the first profile
point is greater than 0, the stirrer will gradually increase in speed to this
speed, rather than jumping up to to that speed at that time.~~ ~~~~

Programmed the fee schedule:

  1.  ~~To create a schedule to to turn on the pump after 2 days (48 hours) for 22.5 minutes (~450 mL at ~20 mL/minute), followed the instructions below:  
~~ ~~

    1.  ~~Opened the SUBS-B pump menu~~
    2.  ~~Changed the SUBS-B MODE to MANUAL:OFF  
~~

    3.  ~~Opened the PROFILE sub-menu~~
    4.  ~~Set a timepoint for 000:00:00 with 0% pump output.~~
    5.  ~~Set a timepoint for 048:00:00 with 0% pump output.  
~~

    6.  ~~Set a timepoint for 048:00:01 with 100% pump output.~~
    7.  ~~Set a timepoint for 048:22:30 with 100% pump output.~~
    8.  ~~Set a timepoint for 048:22:31 with 0% pump output.~~
~~ ~~~~

  2.  ~~To create a schedule to to turn on the pump again after 4 days (96 hours) for 45 minutes (~900 mL at ~20 mL/minute), followed the instructions below:  
~~

    1.  ~~Set a timepoint for 000:00:00 with 0% pump output.~~
    2.  ~~Set a timepoint for 096:00:00 with 0% pump output.  
~~

    3.  ~~Set a timepoint for 096:00:01 with 100% pump output.~~
    4.  ~~Set a timepoint for 096:45:00 with 100% pump output.~~
    5.  ~~Set a timepoint for 096:45:01 with 0% pump output.  
~~

  3.  ~~To program the pump to follow the schedule:  
~~

    1.  ~~Changed the SUBS-B MODE to PROFILE~~
    2.  ~~ ~~Closed the menu~~~~
