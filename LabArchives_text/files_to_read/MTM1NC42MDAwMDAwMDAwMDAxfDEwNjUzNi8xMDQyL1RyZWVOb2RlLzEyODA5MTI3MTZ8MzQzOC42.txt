Batch 00 (CHO-S WCB) Overview

Batch Objectives/Experimental Plan:

  * Produce a WCB cryobank of CHO-S suspension adapted cells for CHO production batches and science R&D at 10 million cells per vial.
    * Produce enough vials for 3 months worth of batches i.e., 120 million, assuming each batch is initially seeded at 10 million cells and 4 batches are started in a single month.

Batch Timeline (Proliferation days & media in each passage & Flask no./type):

Passage NumberProliferation daysProliferation MediaFlask No./Type  
P1 (P2)2Hycell CHO + 1% Glutamax + 1X P/S1x E125  
P2 (P3)31x E500  
  
Notable Events:

  * CHO-S cells were passaged into a E500 flask after two days in culture following the thaw, compared to four days when the MCB was generated.
  * CHO-S were harvested and cryobanked after ~5 days in suspension culture into 12 vials at a density of 10 million cells per vial.
  * A total of 291 million cells were harvested from an initial cell seeding of 10 million.
  * Cells exhibited a total of 4.86 doublings and a doubling time of 24.6 hours.
  * The remaining 171 million cells were frozen at -20Â°C to be used in product development.
  * Cells were grown in a quarter of the recommended concentration of L-Glutamine/Glutamax (2mM instead of 8mM).
