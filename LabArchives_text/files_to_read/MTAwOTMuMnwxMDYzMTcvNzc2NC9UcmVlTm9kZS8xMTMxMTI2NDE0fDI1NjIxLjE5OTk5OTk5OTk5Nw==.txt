Suspension cell cultures 11285 and 11281 were discarded as they were regarded
as a potential contamination risk. The cultures were cloudy and showed signs
of microbial growth when inspected under 20x objective under the primovert
after being pipetted into a 96 well plate. The BCL2L11 culture was also
discarded as it had not sign positive signs of growth for close to 30 days
since seeding. It was decided that the clone plates would not be carried
forward given the large time investment that would be needed to maintain these
clones without any evidence the mutations positively impact suspension
adaptation.
