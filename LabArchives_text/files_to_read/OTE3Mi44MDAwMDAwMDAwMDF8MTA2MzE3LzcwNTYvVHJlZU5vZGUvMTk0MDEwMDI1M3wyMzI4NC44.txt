Digestion with Collagenase II in sterile pot with scissors (Michael)  

  1. Collect the adipose samples (~3-5g) and transfer into tube containing 20 mL of dPBS (incl 5x P/S).
  2. Wash 3 times in 20mL fresh dPBS (w. 5x P/S)
  3. Transfer tubes into lab.
  4. Transfer adipose sample to 1 x 120mL sterile pot.
  5. Mince adipose sample with scissors until a slurry is developed (5-8 mins).   12:28 - 12:35 pm
  6. Add 1x autoclaved magnetic stirrer grommet to the sample pot
  7. Top up sterile pot containing slurry with 40mL of Digestion buffer  12:35 pm
  8. Parafilm pot and Incubate at 37ºC with agitation for 30 mins.
    1. start time: 
  9. Transfer contents from the 120mL sterile pot into 1 new x 50mL tube.
  10. Centrifuge at 1000 x g for 5 min at RT.   : - : pm
  11. Aspirate supernatant from pellet.
  12. Resuspend each pellet in 30mL of DMEM/F12
  13. Seed into 1x T175
  14. Parafilm edges of each plate/vessel and transfer into a 37ºC incubator with 5% CO2   : pm
