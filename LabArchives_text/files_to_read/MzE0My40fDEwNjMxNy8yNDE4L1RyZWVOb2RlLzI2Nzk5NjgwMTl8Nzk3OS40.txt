Prepare materials for thaw and seed:

1\. Aliquotted 25 mL of growth medium into 1 x E125 flask and placed in
incubator at least 30 minutes before thaw

2\. Aliquotted 9 mL of neutralising medium (DMEM + 1% P/S) into 1 x 15 mL tube
and placed in water bath

  * Time that aliquots were placed in the water bath/incubator:   11:45     

  




## Thaw and seed vial:

  1. Collected the cryovial from Liquid Nitrogen storage & place in foam floater in water bath for 5 min 12:19 - 12:24   
Location where cryovial was collected from:  
Vial details:  1   x  NANDO3F  cryovials at  1 million  cells each for a total
of   1 million  cells  
Brew

Tower #5  

Box #1  

Vial location: A1  

Vial ID: 3905 (11 of 32)  

  2. Wiped down the vial with 70% ethanol and transferred to BSC.
  3. Transferred  500 uL of neutralising medium to vial to make total volume up to 1 mL. Pipette-mixed gently. 
  4. Transferred entire 1 mL cell suspension to 10 mL aliquot of neutralising medium 
  5. Centrifuged the cells at 300 x g for 5 min at RT. 12:26 - 12:31
  6. Removed supernatant to remove residual DMSO from the cells. Note: Left ~1.5 mL to be extra sure not to aspirate any cells 
  7. Re-suspended the pellet in 10mL of the pre-warmed growth medium in the E125 flask. Transfer the cell suspension back to the shake flask. Incubate at 37ÂºC, 5% CO2 
  8. Set shaker to continuous shaking at 130 RPM. 12:36``

  

Making labels

Note - You will need to increase the passage number by one. (i.e. if your
thawed vial ID has a passage number of 3, when you make a culture ID for you
vessel you will need change the passage number to 4 on Airtable.)
