Process:

1\. Aliquotted   mL  mL of  Growth Media into       tube(s). Placed in water
bath   : a/pm

2\. Removed  100  % of supernatant from vessel.

3\. Replaced with  30 mL (per well/per vessel) of  growth   media.

4\. Returned vessel to incubate at:

  * [x]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (aviary cells)

  

  * [x]  Thermo Incubator (ID #13)
  * [ ]  Top Sanyo Incubator (ID #25)
  * [ ]  Bottom Sanyo Incubator
  * [ ]  Top Binder Incubator
  * [ ]  Bottom Binder Incubator
