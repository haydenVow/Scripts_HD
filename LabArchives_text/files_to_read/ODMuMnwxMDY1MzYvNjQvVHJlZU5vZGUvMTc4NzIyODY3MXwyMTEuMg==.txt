### Batch notes

Implement TGF-b1 and Vitamin C (LAA2P) treatment for producing Fibroblast
sheets/ aggregates for half the batch and the other half maintain untreated
and the usual method of cell pellet harvest.

Harvest trypLE time will be kept at 18 minutes with a mid-incubation agitation
to encourage maximum dissociation, and provide baseline metrics for
fibroblasts before testing harvest optimisation methods.
