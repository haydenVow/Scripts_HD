## Performed by: Sarah/Anushka  




Note that cells were counted prior to the feed, in the entire 10mL cell
suspension, due to the low cell density, counts are likely to be innacurate.




Process:  

  1. Aliquoted 90mL Nuvonis suspension media (without growth factors) into a urine jar (you will have 10ml surplus)
  2. In the BSC, add 4.5ul EGF, 180ul FGF2 and 90ul IGF1-LR3 to the urine jar. 
  3. Placed in the water bath and warm to 37C 
  4. Collected vessels from shaker, Centrifuged for 5min at 500RPM
  5. Aspirated and discarded 8mL media from each tube (leaving 2mL)
  6. Re-suspended cell pellets in the remaining media, repeatedly pipetting with a 1mL pipette to break up clumps. 
  7. Added 8mL of pre-warmed media to each vessel and returned them to the incubator, shaking at either 175 or 200RPM

Incubator 77 or 78 Library Lab, 37C, 5% CO2
