Process


  1. Removed flasks from incubator 
  2. Took 2 x 50 uL samples from each E-flask
  3. Performed cell counts and averaged for each flask and each condition (recorded in table below)
  4. Made up 50 mL of a 300 g/L solution of glucose in Milli-Q
  5. Aliquoted following volumes of media with growth factors and warmed in water bath. Want to trial upping RPMI glucose concentration to 6 g/L (the glucose concentration in Freestyle medium). RPMI has 2 g/L, so we need to add 4 g/L to bring it up to 6 g/L. This translates to adding 0.08 g to 20 mL of medium, or 266 uL of a 300 g/L solution).
    1. 40 mL RPMI suspension medium + 0.0005 mg/mL IGF + 0.0005 mg/mL FGF-B \+ 0.0001 mg/mL EGF
  6. Transferred cultures to 2 x 50 mL tubes
  7. Centrifuged at 500 x g for 5 min
  8. Aspirated 100% of supernatant, resuspended cells in 40 mL of pre-prepared RPMI suspension medium (combined pellets)
  9. Split into 2 x 20 mL aliquots in 2 x E-125s (strained through 40 uL cell strainers)
    * Note: had to use old strainers with higher contamination risk, as we are still waiting on more of the new strainers 
  10. Added 266 uL of glucose (300 g/L) to 1 x E-125 ~~  
~~

  11. Returned cultures to incubate at 37 'C, 5% CO2, 120 RPM

Think moving into 30 mL was mistake - too dilute. Re-seeding back at 20 mL.
