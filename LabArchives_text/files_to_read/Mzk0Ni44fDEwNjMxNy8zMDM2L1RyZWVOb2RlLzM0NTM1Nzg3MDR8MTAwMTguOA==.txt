Process:

  1. Place the media reservoir in thermo to warm up media   11:16 am 
  2. Briefly spin the 96 dwwp-well plates down in the centrifuge to collect all the media. 20 seconds at 800g is appropriate.
  3. Removed   100 % of supernatant from vessel. 
  4. Replaced with   140uL (per well/per vessel) of   DSD  media. 
  5. Returned vessel to incubate at:

  * [x]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (aviary cells)

  

  * Incubator (#thermo  ), Lab [Main/Library/Production]




### Observations/Summary:

100  % media changed on vessel(s)

  1. DSD media was dropped the previous day. Upon observation, media appears to be fine. No loss of media or crossover
  2. One well in the DSD media had significantly more media than the others.
