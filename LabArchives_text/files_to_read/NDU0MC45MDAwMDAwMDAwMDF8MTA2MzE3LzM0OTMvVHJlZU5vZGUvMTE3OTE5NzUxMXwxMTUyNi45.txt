Process

1\. Each of the cultures listed in the table bellow has 1 well filled. Image
each culture on 10x magnification and add Mia links to the table bellow. While
imaging observe for any signs of contamination.




Observations:

7723 - patchy in some areas - looks like there are streaks where cells are
missing

7720 - lots of floaties

7726 - similar to 7723

7721 - lots of floating debris. Some cells adhered.

7725 - might see some msucle cells adhered?:
