The media will be pr-aliquoted into a 48-well plate stored in the fridge. This
plate will need to be placed into the incubator for at least 30 minutes to be
prewarmed.  
  
  




Growth Media:

  * [x]  E6

Total media required: 36 mL (1mL in each well according to plate map above)




Process:

1\. Place pre-aliquoted 48-well plate with growth media into the incubator to
be warmed for at least 30 minutes. Placed in incubator   08:11 am  \-  08:53
am  

  1. Plate is labelled as SAT FEED AK EPIC 19190  

2\. Transfer plate containing the 48-well inserts + scaffolds and plate
containing warmed media into the BSC.

3\. Using sterile tweezers or fingers, carefully remove the well inserts from
the plate they are housed in and transfer them into the new plate containing
the fresh media that was warmed in the previous steps.

  1. Some inserts may be a bit difficult to insert into the wells, can use the tweezers to wiggle them into the wells. 
  2. Once the well inserts have been moved into the new plate please use the old lid (which contains the plate ID) as the lid for the new plate.

4\. Parafilm the plate whilst it is still in the BSC

5\. Returned vessel to incubate at: 08:56 am

  * [x]  37ÂºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
