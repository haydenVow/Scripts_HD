ECM gel coating Process  
  
1\. Thawed aliquot of ECM gel in fridge

2\. Added 60 uL of ECM gel to 4.74 mL of cold DMEM

3\. Added 200 uL of mixture to each well of 1x24-well plate

4\. Transferred to 4C fridge to allow it to set for 2 hours, 17:35

5\. Transferred to 37C incubator 15 mins prior to use.




### Process:

1\. Took image of vessel with microscope on phase setting.

2\. Gelatin coated 4x T175 + 1x 96-well plate +  1x 24-well plate with sterile
filtered 0.1% gelatin solution and then incubated all coated flasks at 37˚C.  

  1. Time when all vessels(s) placed into the incubator       

3\. Aliquotted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then
placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath for a minimum of 20 minutes
prior to use:

  1. TrypLE:  1x40 mL tryple  

  2.  dPBS 2x40mL   

  3. Growth media (for seeding):  2x 60 mL (for seeding T175) + 30 uL p38i, 1x 10 mL + 5 uL p38i (for seeding 2x24-well plates), 3.5 mL + 1.75 uL p38i (for 96-well plate)  

Time that all aliquots were placed in the water bath the warm before use
18:00

Note: if aliquots were placed in water bath at different time, record the time
stamp for each individual solution.




PASSAGE - 4XT175

4\. Removed vessel(s) from the incubator    18:25

5\. Washed the vessel(s) with dPBS (warmed).

6\. Added      10   mL tryple to each vessel/well and incubated at 37˚C.

  1. Start for TrypLE was  18:25-18:35

7\. Neutralised with     10mL     dPBS and combined cell suspension into 2x
50mL     tube.

8\. Centrifuged at 650 x g for 5 min.

  1. Start/Finish time for centrifugation was   18:46-18:51   




BUFFY PASSAGE - 4XT175

9\. Aspirated the supernatant(s).

10\. Resuspended pellet(s) in     1 mL    Growth      media

11\. Aliquoted      10uL    of resuspended cells into a microcentrifuge tube
for cell count.

12\. Performed a cell count using the haemocytometer and recorded the cell
count data in the Google Doc spreadsheet: Cell Count Spreadsheet or cell count
widget below

  1. Total cell number was:   BUFFY   1,456,000   DOLLY  1,276,000    

  2. Volume of cell suspension required for subculture was:         
BUFFY   240 uL for 96-well plate, 120 uL for 2xT175s, 470 uL 24 well plate
DOLLY  137 uL for 2xT175s  

  3. Cell density per vessel:  
T-175  500/cm2  
 24-plates     750/cm2  
Cell density per vessel: 96-well plate    750/cm2  




BUFFY PASSAGE - 4XT175

13\. Transferred      As above     µl of cell suspension to the pre-warmed
growth media

14\. Transferred cell suspension into the pre-gelatin coated      2xT175s, 1x
96-well plate (for BUFFY and DOLLY) and 2xT175s (For C2C12)   vessels

15\. Left at RT in the BSC for 30 min to allow cells to settle  

16\. Transferred vessel(s) to incubate at: 20:54

  * [X]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (avian cells)
