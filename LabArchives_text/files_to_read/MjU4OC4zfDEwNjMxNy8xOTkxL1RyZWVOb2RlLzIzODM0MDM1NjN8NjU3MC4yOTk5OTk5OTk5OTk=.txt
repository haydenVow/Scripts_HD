Process:

1\. Aliquotted   1 mL  mL of E6 media into   1 x 15mL   tube and aliquotted
1 mL  mL of  HS media into   1 x 15mL   tube. Placed both tubes in water bath
11:35

2\. Removed  100  % of Growth Media from vessel. 11:50  

3\. Replaced with  150 uL (per well/per vessel) of  Diff   media.

4\. Returned vessel to incubate at  11:57

  * [X]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (aviary cells)

  

  * Incubator (#77 ), Lab [Library]
