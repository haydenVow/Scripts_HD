Prepare materials for thaw and seed:

1\. Details of the cultureware coating procedure can be found here  

2\. Aliquotted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then
placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath for a minimum of 20 minutes
prior to use:

  *  Growth media (for thawing and seeding):   50 mL 
  * Time that aliquot was placed in the water bath to warm before use:   9:40 am 

  




## Thaw and seed vial:

3\. Collected the cryovial from Liquid Nitrogen storage & place in foam
floater in water bath for 5 min  10:19 - 10:24 am

Location where cryovial was collected from:

Vial details:  3   x   C2C12 cryovials at   540K  cells each for a total of
~ 1500K  cells

Brew: Liquid Nitrogen  

Tower/Bucket:  2  

Box/Cane: 6  

Vial location: B8, B9, C1  

Vial ID(s): 2878, 2879, 2880  

`4. Ethanol sprayed & transferred the vial(s) to the BSC.`

`5.  Added 500 µL of Growth Media (to generate a total volume of 1mL in the
cryovial) to the cryovial, resuspended the cell suspension gently to reduce
osmotic shock. `

`6. Collected the entire 1mL of cell suspension & transfer into the pre-warmed
tube of Growth Media for all 3 vials  
`

`7. Using a 10mL serological pipette, resuspended & distributed the cells
evenly in the  19 mL of pre-warmed Growth Media (prepared in Step 2). `

`          Cell count, result: xxxx M cells in 21 mL GM`

`8. Transferred  1 mL to each pre-coated  12wp  well, allow to rest in the BSC
at RT for 30 min   pm `

`9. Transferred flask/plate(s) to incubate at: `

  * [X]  37ºC @ : a/pm, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (aviary cells)

  

Making labels

Note - You will need to increase the passage number by one. (i.e. if your
thawed vial ID has a passage number of 3, when you make a culture ID for you
vessel you will need change the passage number to 4 on Airtable.)

Summary:

Thawed C2C12 cells and seeded into 21x 12wp wells with growth media (DMEM /
F12 + 20% FBS + 1X P/S + p38i inhibitor).
