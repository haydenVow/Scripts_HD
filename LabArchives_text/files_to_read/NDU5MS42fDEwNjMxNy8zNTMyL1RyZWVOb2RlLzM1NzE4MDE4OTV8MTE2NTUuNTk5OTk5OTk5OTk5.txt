Perform feed using below volumes:

  






Growth Media:

  * [x]  DMEM/F12 + 20% FBS + 1X P/S
  * [x]  M199/F12 + 20% FBS + 1X P/S




Reagent preparation  
1\. Aliquot  5.5 mL DMEM/F12 +20% FBS +1x p/S . Placed in incubator to warm to
37 degrees  
2\. Aliquot  4 mL DMEM/F12 +20% FBS +1x p/S . Placed in water bath to warm to
30 degrees  
3\. Aliquot  4 mL M199 +20% FBS +1x p/S . Placed in water bath to warm to 30
degrees  

 11:57  




Process

1\. Image cells at 10x magnification

2\. Removed  1.5mL of media from each well of the 6-well plates and 0.5Ml of
media from each well of the 24-well plates  . Please remove media by
aspirating from the surface, avoid tilting the plate.

3\. Replaced with   1.5 mL (6-well plates)  0.5 mL  (24-well plates) of
respective    growth  media  (see table below for media details for each
culture).

4\. Returned vessel to incubate at: timestamp 12:38  

  * [x]  37ºC, 5% CO2  OR [x]  30ºC, 5% CO2  (see table bellow)
