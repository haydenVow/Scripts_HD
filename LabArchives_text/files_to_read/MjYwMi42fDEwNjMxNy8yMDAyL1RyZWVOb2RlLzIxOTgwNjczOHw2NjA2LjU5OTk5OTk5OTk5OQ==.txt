Reagent preparation:

Use the following spreadsheet to:

  * Determine the total amount of regent required for primary staining
  * Provide more information on antibody types

1\. Prepared    16mL  PBST (0.2% Triton-X)

2\. Prepared    24mL  blocking buffer: PBST (0.1% Triton-X + PBS) + 3% bovine
serum albumin (BSA). (Kept in the fridge until needed in blocking step)

3\. Prepared Primary Antibody Mix: :  25 µL   Primary #1 MyoG (Santa Cruz)
(1:200  ) in  5  mL Blocking Buffer and  100 µL   Primary #2 MF20 (DSHB)
(1:50) in  5  mL Blocking Buffer and a combined mix of both antibodies in
their respective dilutions for fluorescent control (in 5mL blocking buffer).

Pipette-mixed antibody mix and stored refrigerated away from light until
needed.

Process:

Permeabilise

1\. Removed PBS from each well.

2\. Added  100 µL PBST (0.2% Triton-X) to each well for 15 min:  11:45 - 12:00
pm

3\. Aspirated PBST for each well.




Blocking

1\. Added  100 µL of blocking buffer (3% BSA in PBST [0.1% Triton-X]) and
incubate for 45 minutes - 1hr at RT. (no more than 1 hour):   12:10 - 1:10
a/pm




Single/Simultaneous Primary Antibody staining

1\. Removed blocking buffer from each well.

2\. Incubated cells with primary antibody for 90min - 2hrs at RT, or 4ºC
overnight:   13:26 - Overnight a/pm

3\. Parafilmed plates and stored at 4ºC in tissue culture lab Fridge.

After this step, all further task should be performed in a dark room. The
vessel should also be wrapped foil when not used.

Observations/Summary:

  * ### Both plates were frozen upon removal from staining and fixing fridge in Main Lab, plates were placed in Thermo incubator at 11:05am to thaw out.

  




### Results:

  * Results were;
    * [ ]  As Usual (this is a repetitive task)
    * [ ]  Unexpected because...
    * [X]  Need to be further analysed
    * [ ]  Other (.......)
