Those from Freestyle medium: Seed all flasks at 150k cells/mL (3M cells in
20mL) and the extra flask that we will seed in 50/50 RPMI/Hycell medium for
the slow adaptation experiment will be seeded at 84k cells/mL (1.68M cells in
20mL).

Those from 90/10 RPMI/Hycell: Seed all flasks at 150k cells/mL (3M cells in
20mL)


Process


  1. Aliquoted 1 x 60 mL of each media type:  
  

    1. HEK HD Part A+ B
    2. 90/10 RPMI + Part B/HEK HD Part A + B
    3. HEK HD + Nuvonis 
    4. 90/10 RPMI + Nuvonis/HEK HD  \+ Nuvonis 
    5. CHO HD Part A + B
    6. 90/10 RPMI + Part B/CHO HD Part A + B
    7. CHO HD \+ Nuvonis 
    8. 90/10 RPMI + Nuvonis/CHO HD \+ Nuvonis
    9. Freestyle *40mL
    10. 90/10 RPMI/Hycell *40mL  
  

  2. Added growth factors (IGF + EGF)   
  
Both for those containing HEK/CHO HD + Nuvonis OR 90/10 RPMI + Nuvonis/HEK/CHO
HD medium + Nuvonis, add the following amounts of IGF and EGF:  
  
  
  

  3. Placed in water bath 
  4. Split Freestyle cell suspension and 90/10 RPMI/Hycell collected from continuous culture (Freestyle culture lab book entry / 90/10 culture lab book entry) into 12 equal aliquots each (3M cells per aliquot; 1.866 mL/aliquot in the case of the Freestyle & 2.060mL/aliquot in the case of 90/10 RPMI/Hycell).
  5. Added 20 mL of each medium into each one of the 28 x E-125 flasks.
  6. Added 1.866 mL of the Freestyle cell suspension per E-125 flask in the case of those sub-cultured from the Freestyle 293 flask and 2.060mL of the 90/10 RPMI/Hycell per E-125 flask in the case of those sub-cultured from the 90/10 RPMI/Hycell.
  7. Placed all 28 x E-125 in incubator at 37'C, 5% CO2, 120 RPM.  
  
*Notes:   
  
(1) The feed medium provided by HiMedia is meant to be used to feed cell
cultures already adapted to CHO HD medium every second day 5 days post-
seeding. The recommended amount of this feed supplement to add to the vessel
is 5% of the total volume of media, which in our case is equivalent to 1
mL/E-125 containing CHO HD medium (volume will increase by 1 mL every feed
day). It is recommended to increase the frequency of feed supplement treatment
to once a day if cell densities are high past day 10 in culture as the rate of
nutrient exhaustion will be greater.  


Observations


Flask 12102 was aliquotted less cell suspension than the rest of the flasks.
