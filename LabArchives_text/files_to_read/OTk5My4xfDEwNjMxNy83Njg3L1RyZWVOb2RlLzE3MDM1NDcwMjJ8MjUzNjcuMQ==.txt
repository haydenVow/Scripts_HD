AIM/PURPOSE To facilitate BOBBO cell proliferation in suspension culture.

HYPOTHESIS  
1\. When cultured in e-125 shaker flasks, sustained proliferation ( for >2
weeks) of BOBBO cells will be observed in one or more of the following culture
medias.

  * Nuvonis suspension media + 100ng/mL FGF2
  * Nuvonis suspension media + 100ng/mL FGF2 + 100ng/mL RGD
  * Nuvonis suspension media + 100ng/mL FGF2 + 100ng/mL YIGSR
  * Nuvonis suspension media + 100ng/mL FGF2 + 100ng/mL RGD \+ 100ng/mL YIGSR
  * Nuvonis suspension media + 100ng/mL FGF2 + 100ng/mL RGD \+ 100ng/mL YIGSR  \+ 1:100 Revita cell.
