Preparation of media conditions:

*All conditions, except for the serum control, will be in the same standard growth media which will be DMEM/F12 + 2% FBS + 1X P/S + anticlumping agent 1:100 + 0.1% Poloxamer 188. The only difference will be the MC supplementation added. 

Performed by: CO

Prepare 1.5 L of GM with ACA (1:100) and poloxamer 188 (0.1%), use 1 L for 1 %
MC and the rest for the dilutions:

[1] GM + 0.1% MC - 100 mL - dilute 10 mL of [5] with 90 mL GM/ACA/POLO

[2] GM + 0.3 MC - 100 mL - dilute 30 mL of [5] with 70 mL GM/ACA/POLO

[3] GM + 0.45% MC - 500 mL - dilute 225 mL of [5] with 275 mL GM/ACA/POLO

[4] GM + 0.6% MC - 100 mL - dilute 60 mL of [5] with 40 mL GM/ACA/POLO

[5] GM + 1% MC - 500 mL - prepare 1L in GM containing POLO and ACA, use 500 mL
for dilutions  




1\. Prepare growth media for each condition

2\. Transferred the required volume of each reagent in the table above to each
vessel and then placed vessels in incubator for a minimum of 20 minutes prior
to use:

  * Growth media (for seeding) 50 mL bioreactor spin tubes:   4 mL  (for each condition in map   \- 6 in total) 
  * Growth media (for seeding) E125 flasks:  24  mL  (for each condition in map - 3 in total) 
  * Growth media 2% FBS: 24 mL for cell resuspension  

  * Growth media 2% FBS: 15 mL for neutralising   

  * Time that aliquot was placed in the incubator to warm before use:   12:36      

  




## Thaw and seed vials:

Amount of cells required =  24,000,000 cells (to seed cells at 200,000
cells/mL):

\- 6x 50 mL bioreactor spin tubes (5 mL media in each tube) at 1,000,000 cells
per tube =  6,000,000 cells

\- 3x E125 flasks at 6,000,000 cells per flask = 18,000,000 cells

  

1\. Collected the cryovials (x3 - DOLLY12 fibroblasts) from Liquid Nitrogen
storage & place in foam floater in water bath for 5 min   12:45  

Location where cryovial was collected from: Tower 5, Box 3  

Vial details:  3   x  DOLLY12 Fibroblast  cryovials at  5/10M  cells each for
a total of   25M  cells 3269

`2. Ethanol sprayed & transferred the vial(s) to the BSC.`

3\. Added     500 uL   of growth media (media prepared for neutralising) to
generate a total volume of 1 mL in each of the cryovials, resuspending the
cell suspension gently to reduce osmotic shock.

4\. Transfer entire cell suspensions into the remainder of the aliquot of
neutralising medium

5\. Centrifuge the cells at 300 x g for 5 min at RT:     12 : 54    \-   12
:59  

6\. Removed supernatant to remove residual DMSO from cells. Note be extra
careful not to aspirate any cells  

7\. Resuspended the pellet in the 24 mL of growth media prepared for seeding
the cells.

8\. Transfer   1000 uL of the cell suspension into each of the pre warmed
growth media conditions (to seed cells at 200,000 cells/mL - 6 conditions
total). Gently resuspended and distribute the cells evenly in 4 mL or pre-
warmed growth media using a p1000

9\. Transfer   6000 uL of the cell suspension into each of the pre warmed
growth media conditions (to seed cells at 200,000 cells/mL - 3 conditions for
the three E125 flasks. Gently resuspended and distribute the cells evenly in
24 mL or pre-warmed growth media using a 10 mL pipette.

10\. Transferred flask/plates(s) to incubate at: `   13:10  
`

  * [x]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (aviary cells)

10\. E125 flasks were shaken at 120 RPM to achieve P/V ~60 W/m3 as per the
power/kLa calculator:

11\. 50 mL bioreactor spin tubes were shaken at 206 RPM to achieve  P/V ~60
W/m3 as per the power/kLa calculator:

Making labels

Note - You will need to increase the passage number by one. (i.e. if your
thawed vial ID has a passage number of 3, when you make a culture ID for you
vessel you will need change the passage number to 4 on Airtable.)

Summary:

0.3% MC media looks a little more pink than the others

1% MC spin tube has slightly fewer cells than others, ran out of suspension
towards this tube
