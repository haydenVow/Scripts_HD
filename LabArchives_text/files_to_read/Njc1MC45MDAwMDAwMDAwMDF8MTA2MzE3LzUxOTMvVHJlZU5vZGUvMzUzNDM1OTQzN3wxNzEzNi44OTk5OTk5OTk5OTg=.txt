Process:

  1. Please observe the 2x 175s under the microscope to check for any interesting/ abnormal findings. 09:20
  2. Place the already aliquoted media into the water bath (30ºC, for reptilian cells)   08:50
  3. Removed  50 % of supernatant (6 mL) from each vessel.  (Please use separate serologicals when aspirating supernatant for each flask as they are different types of CHOMP cells)
  4. Replaced with  6 mL per vessel of  growth  medium. (Please use separate serologicals when transfering the medium into each flask as they are different types of CHOMP cells)
  5. Returned vessel to incubate at:   09:29

  * [ ]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
