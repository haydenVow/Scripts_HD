Batch 35 Overview

Fibroblast CHOMP 09

Batch Total Weight: 139.4g

Batch Objectives/Outline:

  * Produce as much mass as possible for investor tastings  
  

Batch Timeline (Proliferation days in each passage & Flask no./type):

Passage NumberProliferation daysFlask No./Type  
P171x10CF and 1x4CF  
P276x10CF and 1x4CF  
P32115x10CS and 1x5CS  
  
  

Notable events:

  * This batch was originally planned to have a total of 25x10CS in the final passage, however due to a seeding error in the first passage (1x10CF and 1x4CF seeded instead of 1x10CF and 2x4CF) and a reduced growth rate resulting in a lower confluence at the Passage 2 planned date (approx. 70%) only 15x10CS and 1x5CS were able to be seeded by the third and final passage. 
  * 1x10CS was discarded due to fungal contamination (contamination issues for this batch are detailed below)
  * TrypLE was required to harvest 9 out of 15x10CS due to some layers not peeling




Contamination Issues:

  * 04/04/22 \- Batch moved to Main lab Old Thermo incubators during last phase of treatment 
  * 08/04/22 - 
    * Batch 35 was harvested
    * No visible signs of contamination in any flasks expect for 1x10CS which had fungal colonies throughout the flask and also black mould on the lid (#11346 contaminated in incubator 157)
  * 08/04/22 - To limit cross contamination and try to identify the cause a number of precautions were taken:
    * A settle plate (TSA agar) was placed in each incubator for 4 hours. (Incubators #115, #156, #157, #158 - Old Thermos)
    * 50mL of media was collected from at least one flask from each incubator into individual tubes during the harvest and incubate them to see if anything grows
    * The harvested aggregates were kept in separate tubes for each incubator. This was done to avoid contaminating the entire batch if the contamination source was coming from one or more particular incubators. 
      * A sample from each of these tubes was also sent away for testing. These amples were stored at 4'C over the weekend before sending for QC at Quantal (sent 11/04/12)

  * 10/04/22 - TSA plates and media samples were observed
    * Incubator #156 contained 1CFU, about 2cm in diameter, filamentous fibres with a white opaque centre
    * Incubator #158 contained 20CFU, ranging from 0.5cm - 2cm in diameter. These colonies were all identical in colour and shape, with a dark green centre and surrounded by white filamentous fibres.  
Plates were immediately parafilmed and placed in the QC fridge.

  * 11/04/22 \- The Incubators in question with this batch were found to contain mould in hard to reach/hard to clean areas and as a result were decommissioned from the lab
