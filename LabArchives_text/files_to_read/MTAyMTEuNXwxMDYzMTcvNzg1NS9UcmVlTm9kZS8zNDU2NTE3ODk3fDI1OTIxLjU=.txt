### Process:

1\. Took image of vessel with microscope on phase setting.

2\. Gelatin coated    10    x    10CF    vessel with sterile filtered 0.1%
gelatin solution and then incubated all coated flasks at 37˚C.

  1. Time when all vessels(s) placed into the incubator     11:00 am 

3\. Aliquotted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then
placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath for a minimum of 20 minutes
prior to use:

  1. TrypLE:    1000    mL in       tubes
  2.  dPBS (for neutralising):     1000    mL
  3.  dPBS (for washing):     1000   mL
  4. Growth media (for pellet re-suspension):   50  mL
  5. Growth media (for seeding):    9.2L  

Time that dPBS & GM aliquots were placed in the water bath the warm before use
11:30 am

Time that Tryple aliquots were placed in the water bath the warm before use
11:00 am

Note: if aliquots were placed in water bath at different time, record the time
stamp for each individual solution.




5\. Washed the vessel(s) with dPBS (warmed).

6\. Added      500 x 2   mL Tryple to each vessel/well and incubated at 37˚C.

  1. Start/Finish for TrypLE was     15:36 - 15:51 pm 

7\. Neutralised with     200mL  each flask   dPBS and combined cell suspension
into a    16 x 50mL    tube.

8\. Centrifuged at 650 x g for 5 min.

  1. Start/Finish time for centrifugation was   15:54 - 15:59 pm 




9\. Aspirated the supernatant(s).

10\. Resuspended pellet(s) in   30  mL     Growth     media    18:00  pm

11\. Aliquoted     20 uL     of resuspended cells into a microcentrifuge tube
for cell count.

12\. Performed a cell count using the haemocytometer and recorded the cell
count data in the Google Doc spreadsheet: Cell Count Spreadsheet or cell count
widget below

  1. Total cell number was:      56,064,000     




13\. Transferred      half     µl of cell suspension to the pre-warmed
1.5L     Growth media:    18:20 pm

14\. Transferred cell suspension into the pre-gelatin coated    2 x 10CF
vessel.

16\. Transferred vessel(s) to incubate at: 18:30 pm  

  * [X]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (avian cells)




Observations/Summary:

Cells were centrifuged a few times due to balancing issues with Yurt village
centrifuge.
