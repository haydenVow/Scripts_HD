Add enough pre-prepared coating to each sample by manual pipetting (for thin
flat scaffolds in 96wp 100ul or under is typically sufficient to saturate the
sample), flip sample in the coating, leave for 1hr then remove excess coating
and leave plate lid ajar in the BSC for drying prior to seeding (~1-2hr). Keep
an eye on the sample, do not allow it to crisp up - exessively dry out.




Please include method for coating and drying scaffolds
