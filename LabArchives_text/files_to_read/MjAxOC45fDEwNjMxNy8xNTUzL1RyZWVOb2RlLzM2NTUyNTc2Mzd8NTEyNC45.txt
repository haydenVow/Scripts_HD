The cells in ACF media died within 3 weeks and did not stay alive beyond 2
passages. Our fibrolife media and the E8+goodies media were not capable of
sustaining fibroblast growth, even when albumin was added. Our control cells
in DMEM/F12 + 20% FBS grew and thus there were no issues with the cells
themselves, only with the cell culture media.
