Cell Count:

  1. Sampled 1mL per flask for trypan blue staining & counting
  2. For manual counting, pipetted 20uL suspension and diluted with an equal volume of trypan blue for 1:2 dilution and performed cell count (manual)
  3. Sampled 200ul from 1mL aliquot in eppendorf tube. Placed Nucelocounter cassette in tube and depressed cassette 
  4. Counts:
    * 12124 (100% 3:1 Mix):  
      * Manual count: 1 565 000 cell/mL
      * Nucleocounter count: 1 730 000 cell/mL (96.6% viability,  19.4um diameter, 2.5% aggregation)
    * 12125 (100% 3:1 Mix): 1 525 000  
      * Manual count:  cell/mL
      * Nucleocounter count: 1 170 000 cell/mL (97.2% viability,  19.4um diameter, 2.1% aggregation)
    * 12126 (100% 3:1 Mix): 1 450 000  
      * Manual count: cell/mL
      * Nucleocounter count: 1 400 000 cell/mL (96.9% viability, 19.7um diameter, 3.2% aggregation)




Process:

  1. Counted cells (see above) out of incubator at 3:30pm, returned to incubation at 3:40pm
  2. Prepared required media: 420mL 3:1 RPMI: Hycell Media mix. Incubated in bead bath at 3:50pm
  3. Passaged cells at 4:15pm:
    * 140mL newly prepared media each into x3 E500 flasks
    * added growth factors directly to flasks: +140ul IGF, +28ul EGF per flask 
    * added 20mL per flask of cell suspension from #12125 to each new flask for~200k/mL seeding density
    * returned flasks to incubation at 4:40pm
  4. Reduced shaking speed to 110RPM from 120RPM at 4:40pm
  5. Added ~30mL dH2O to humidity pan in incubator
