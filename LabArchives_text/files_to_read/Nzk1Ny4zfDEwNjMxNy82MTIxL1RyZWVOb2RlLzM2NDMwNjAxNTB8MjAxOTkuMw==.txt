Below is a dummy header entry to be copy and pasted into all new EPIC pages in
Lab Archives. Please complete the Link to Clubhouse, Aims and Hypothesis
BEFORE you begin the experiment.

At the completion of any EPIC please do the following:  
1\. Ensure all sections of this page are complete  
2\. Email a link to this page to the project leader  
3\. Project leaders will then review all information and digitally sign this
page (click the screwdriver and wrench icon in the top right of this page)  
4\. Project leaders should then send a link to the signed page to James Ryall

RELATED TO MILESTONE:  

AIM/PURPOSE: To use CRISPR-Cas9 gene targeting in CHOMP cells to induce double
stranded breaks into genes of interest potentially involved in suspension
adaptation to reduce/eliminate their expression.

HYPOTHESIS: The knockdown of genes of interest will improve the ability of
CHOMP cells to adapt to suspension

RESULTS SUMMARY:

CONCLUSIONS:

NEXT STEPS: This should be a dot point list of any immediate outcomes, changes
to SOPs, as well as providing a direct link to any new experiments arising
from these findings. Importantly, this section should also include any
potential DEPLOYMENTS to the production team
