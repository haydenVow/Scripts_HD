Process:

  1. Placed 1L of seed media in water bath at approx 10am
  2. Obtained 200 million cells in 68mL of culture suspension from Culture 13216 from cell supply.
  3. Aliquotted cell suspension in 2 x 50ml falcon tube (34mL each) and centrifuged for 5 mins at 300g.
  4. Removed supernatant RPMI media and resuspended cells in 500mL of Seed Media (PRF D/F + 3.75 mg/ml BSA) for each tube.
  5. Seeded 2 x 5CS using each 500mL suspension Incubator 52 in Main Lab (12:30pm)




Observations/Summary:

This morning, the 4CF and T-flasks that were seeded earlier in the week were
inspected on the Main Lab Primo microscope. It was found that the cell density
was still quite low in both flasks, however the cells had all fully adhered in
the T-flask and only 50% had adhered in the cell factories. The key difference
between these flasks is that the Corning T-flasks and the Thermo Fisher 4CFs
have different tissue culture treated plastics. The 4CF has a Nunc delta
coating which evidently does not work for our media and cell type for complete
adherence. This makes sense as all the well plates used in the DSD experiments
were Corning flasks. Hence, its likely that Nunc Delta coating does not work
for our purposes and in future all future flasks should be Corning for
adherent work.  
  
In light of this, it was decided that a Corning 5CS would be used instead of
the Thermo 4CF.
