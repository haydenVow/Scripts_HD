Process:

1\. Aliquotted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then
placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath for a minimum of 20 minutes
prior to use:

  1.  Growth media (for seeding):   30 mL in 1X 50mL Falcon  tubes 
  2.  Time that all aliquot was placed in the water bath to warm before use:   15:55

2\. Collected the cryovial from Liquid Nitrogen storage & place in foam
floater in water bath for 5 min 17:35 - 17:40

Location where cryovial was collected from:

 BREW  

Tower/Bucket # 6

Box/Cane # 6

Vial location:B1

Vial ID(s):BW01k-p

Cryopreservation Details: At a concentration 1,000,000 cells/mL in 1 mL of
growth medium (see care instructions) supplemented with 10% dimethyl sulfoxide
(DMSO).

  




3\. Ethanol sprayed & transferred the vial(s) to the BSC.

4\. Added  1000µL of Growth Media (to generate a total volume of 1mL in the
cryovial) to the cryovial, resuspended the cell suspension gently to reduce
osmotic shock.

5\. Collected the entire 1mL of cell suspension & transfer into the pre-warmed
tube of Growth Media (prepared in Step 2).




6\. Using a 10mL serological pipette, resuspended & distributed the cells
evenly in the   30mL of pre-warmed Growth Media (prepared in Step 2).

  1. e.g. 1 million fibroblasts can be seeded into 1 x T175

8\. Transfered   30mL to each  1X T175  flask/well.

9\. Transfered flask/plate(s) to incubate at:

  * [X]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (aviary cells)




Summary:

Thawed 1x vial of  1M Whale fibroblasts and seeded into 1x T175.
