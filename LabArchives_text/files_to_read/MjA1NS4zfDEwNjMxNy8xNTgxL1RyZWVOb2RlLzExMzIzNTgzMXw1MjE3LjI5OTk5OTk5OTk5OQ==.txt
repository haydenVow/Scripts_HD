Protocol:

  1. Thoroughly wiped down the seed bottle and corresponding line from the bioreoactor with 70% ethanol.
  2. Placed the seed bottle and the end of the seed line in the BSC next to the bioreactor.
  3. Aseptically transferred the seed cells to the seed bottle.
  4. Make an aseptic connection between the bottle and the bioreactor seed line.
  5. Pumped the seed cells into the bioreactor.

Observations/Summary:  

Delayed to put cells into the reactor. Cells sat in the seed bottle for an
additional hour than necessary. However, other than this it was a normal
bioreactor seed.

Noticed clucking noise coming from motor. Mentioned to TT.
