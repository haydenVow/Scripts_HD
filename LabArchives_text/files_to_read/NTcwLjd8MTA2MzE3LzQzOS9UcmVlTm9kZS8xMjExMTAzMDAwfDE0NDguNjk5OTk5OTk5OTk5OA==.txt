Autoclave sterilisation of seitan and bean curd products:

3x Bean curd products purchased from IGA were cut up and placed in autoclave-

either in a dry state or covered with MilliQ water (wet):  
  
\- Dried bean curd sticks (Wet)

using a scalpel and placed into glass tissue culture dishes then placed in the
autoclave for 121'C for 20min

\- Wheat flour + Gluten 100 min
