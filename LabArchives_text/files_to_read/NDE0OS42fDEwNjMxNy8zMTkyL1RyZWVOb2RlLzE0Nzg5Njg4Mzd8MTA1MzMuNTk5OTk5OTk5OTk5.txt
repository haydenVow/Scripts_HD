NameDetailsVolume used (mL)  
DMEM + 10% FBS + 1xP/S + 1:100 ACA  
M6191 + S2496  
25 mL  
D/F + 10% FBS + 1xP/SA5886  
10 mL  
  
  




Process:

  1. Aliquoted:
    1.  25 mL  of  DMEM + 10% FBS + 1xP/S  
      * Added 250 uL of "Anti-Clumping Agent" to aliquot 
    2. 10 mL of D/F + 10% FBS + 1xP/S 
      1. Placed in water bath:   11:09     

  2. Collected culture vessels from shakers, wiped with ethanol-sprayed cloth and brought into BSC (if necessary, paused shakers by pressing the "play" button on the controller on the side wall of the incubator)
  3. Using a 5 mL serelogical pipette, gently pipette-mixed cultures for ~1 minute to break up cell clumps
  4. Pipetted suspension though 70 um cell strainer into 2 x 50 mL tubes
  5. Centrifuged at 300 x g for 5 min. Timestamp: 12:30 - 12:35  

  6. Re-Centrifuged at 350 x g for 5 min (pellet too lose to safely aspirate) 12:37 - 12:42
  7. Aspirated supernatants, taking care to not disrupt or aspirate pellets
  8. Re-suspended cultures in 500 uL of growth media.
  9. Took 1 x 20 uL aliquot and performed cell count, recording counts in this spreadsheet https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1YuTvXJXQQMIMwRZGeqNjdi20WeURg5FpM-1TJ-zrb1c/edit#gid=1104649984
    1. Count (E125): 9,600
    2. Count (spin tube): 12,000
  10. Replaced fresh, warmed media
  11. Gently pipette-mixed cultures again before moving back to spin tube & E125 flask 
  12. Returned vessel to incubator. If shaker was paused, remembered to press play to restart shaking. Timestamp:   12:50    

  13. Incubator (#68), Lab [Main/Library/Production]  




### Observations/Summary:

 100 % media changed on vessel(s)

  1. 7342-NANDO3F-Chicken P3-1of1
  2. 7415-NANDO3F-Chicken P5-1of1  
  
Cell suspension was very clumpy - think straining got rid of a large majority
of cells. Pellet was also very loose - centrifuged twice before count but
still may have aspirated cells.
