###  




Process:

  1. Aliquoted growth media as follows and placed in water bath  

    1. 5 mL  of  each of the following growth media conditions: 0.1%, 0.3%, 0.6% MC in GM
    2. 35 mL of GM + 1% MC 11:20
    3. 35 mL of GM + 0.45% MC 11:20
    4. 35 mL of serum control media 11:20   

  2. Prepared stain buffer in 15 mL tube by combining the following (1 drop of each stain solution per 1 mL of dPBS):
    * 3 mL of dPBS 
    * 6 drops of NucBlue Live Cell Stain ReadyProbes Hoechst 33342
    * 3 drops of NucGreen Dead 488 Cell Stain ReadyProbes Sytox Green
      * Vortexted mix for ~5 seconds, then stored in dark until ready to use.    11:35     

  
E-125 flasks

  1. Collected E125s from shaker, wiped with ethanol-sprayed Rediwipe, and brought into BSC
  2. Using a 25 mL serelogical pipette, gently pipette-mixed culture for 1 minute to break up cell clumps
  3. Pipette suspension though 70 um cell strainer into 3 x 50 mL tubes. Kept E125 vessels in BSC, as culture will be returned to this vessel after feed. 
  4. Centrifuged 50 mL tubes at 300 x g for 5 min.  11:32 - 11:37   

  5. Aspirated   100% (30 mL) of supernatant, taking extra care to not disrupt or aspirate pellet 
  6. Added   30 mL of fresh, warmed growth media to each 50 mL tube
  7. Gently pipette-mixed cultures using serelogical, before moving cell suspension back to E125s
  8. Took 100 uL samples from each culture and stored in separate microtubes until ready to stain alongside 50 mL shake tubes.
  9. Returned E125s to incubator. 11:53

50 mL shake tubes

  1. Paused shaker by pressing the "play" button on the controller on the side wall of the incubator
  2. Collected 6 x 50 mL shake tubes being fed from shaker 
  3. Centrifuged at 300 x g for 5 min. 13:03 - 13:08   

  4. While tubes were centrifuging, loaded protocol linked below (added protocol as attachment) on computer next to OT2 and set up deck as described at calibration step
  5. Loaded 300 uL of stain buffer into column 1 of 96-well plate 
  6. Ethanol-sprayed  6 x 50 mL shake tubes and loaded on OT2 
  7. Collected 6 x media aliquots from water bath, ethanol-sprayed, and loaded on OT2 deck. Ensured that media aliquots matched up with intended feed tubes i.e. medium in A1 of 15 mL tube rack is intended for culture in A1 of 50 mL tube rack, medium in A4 is intended for culture in B1 of 50 mL tube rack, etc. 
  8. Order of culture IDs in 50 mL tube rack:
    * A1: 0.1% MC 7665-F_DOLLY12-Sheep P8-1of1
    * A2: 0.3% MC 7666-F_DOLLY12-Sheep P8-1of1
    * A3: 0.45% MC 7667-F_DOLLY12-Sheep P8-1of1
    * B1: 0.6% MC 7668-F_DOLLY12-Sheep P8-1of1
    * B2: 1% MC 7669-F_DOLLY12-Sheep P8-1of1
    * B3: Control 7670-F_DOLLY12-Sheep P8-1of1
  9. Calibrated for protocol 
  10. Ran protocol  
    1. Start time: 1:18:14 PM
    2. End time:  1:38 PM
  11. Plate map of culture IDs in 96-WP for imaging:

### Staining Process for cell count

  1.  ~~Added 100 uL samples from 6-WPs and E-flasks to staining buffer in 96WP and performed serial dilution by hand to achieve a 12.5% final dilution~~  performed by OT2 ~~  
~~

  2. Added culture IDs to plate map above
  3. Incubated culture in stain at RT in dark for 20 - 30 minutes    13:38 - 14:05    

  4. Diluted to 12.5% in dPBS, then moved 100 uL to empty wells for imaging
  5. Centrifuged the 96-well plate at 650 RCF for 1 minute. Timestamp:  14:07 - 14:08 
  6. Took whole well micrographs using the Zaber microscope on blue & green fluorescence channels (DAPI & 488) 
    * Culture ID images were stored under:  7873 - label made for imaging today   

  7. Counted total cells (blue fluorescent nuclei, stained with Hoechst33342) and dead cells (green fluorescent nuclei, stained with Sytox green)

### Observations/Summary:

Opentron observations/issues:

NA

Zaber observations/issues:

zaber taking images much higher up on well than usual so not capturing whole
well - shut down ImageJ and restarted which seems to have solved the problem

 100 % media changed on vessel(s)
