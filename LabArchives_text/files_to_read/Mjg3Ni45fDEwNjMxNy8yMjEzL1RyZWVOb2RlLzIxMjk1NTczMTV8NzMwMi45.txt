### 7213-C2C12-Mouse P3-1of1  
  
NOTE: Only feeding 8 x wells of adherent culture (E1-H1, E3-H3). All scaffolds
on this plate are not cell-laden and can be ignored.




Process:

1\. Collected  1 x 15 mL tube  labelled "TUES LL" containing  ~3 mL  of  E6
from door of  Biomaterials Fridge . NOTE: This aliquot is also for EPIC18701
adherent culture feed - can perform both feeds simultaneously. Placed aliquot
in water bath  08 :35 - 9:00  

2\. Removed  100 % of supernatant from 8 x wells of 96-well plate.

3\. Replaced with  140  uL x E6 per well

4\. Returned vessel to incubate at:

  * [x]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (aviary cells)

  

  * Incubator (Thermo), Lab [Main/Library/Production]
