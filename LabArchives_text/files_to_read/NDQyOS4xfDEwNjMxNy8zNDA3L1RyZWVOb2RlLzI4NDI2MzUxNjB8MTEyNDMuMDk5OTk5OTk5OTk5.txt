  1. Standalone, doesn't need to be done in conjunction with medium change
  2. P1000
    1. Mix culture
    2. Take 100 uL of sample
      1. As long as the sample is well mixed, it shouldn't matter where the sample is taken from
    3. Transfer to 96 well plate
    4. Repeat for all cultures
  3. P300 8-channel
    1. Aspirate 20 uL of concentrated stain buffer
    2. Transfer stain buffer into each sample well (final volume in each well 120 uL)
    3. Mix cultures

How do we know it is working?

  1. Water run
  2. Thaw out 500k cells 
  3. Perform actual protocol for 1 sample
  4. Compare with 1 manually prepared sample
  5. Image both samples with blue and green fluorescence channels on both the Axio of the 

Required in lab book

  1. Steps required for human operator(s)
  2. OT protocol designed and reviewed
