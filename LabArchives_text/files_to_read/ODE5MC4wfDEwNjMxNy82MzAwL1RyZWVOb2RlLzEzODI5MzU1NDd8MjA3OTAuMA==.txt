### Process:

1\. Aliquotted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then
placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath for a minimum of 20 minutes
prior to use:

  1. TrypLE:      10   mL in    1     tubes
  2.  dPBS (for neutralising):     10    mL
  3.  dPBS (for washing):     10    mL
  4. Growth media (for pellet resuspension):      4   mL
  5. Growth media (for seeding):     60    mL 

Time that all aliquots were placed in the water bath the warm before use    10
: 52  am

Note: if aliquots were placed in water bath at different time, record the time
stamp for each individual solution.




4\. Removed vessel(s) from the incubator   11  : 05  am

5\. Washed the vessel(s) with dPBS (warmed).

6\. Added      10   mL tryple to each vessel/well and incubated at 37˚C.

  1. Start/Finish for TrypLE was    11 : 10  a/pm 

7\. Neutralised with     10     dPBS and combined cell suspension into a
50ml   tube.

8\. Centrifuged at 650 x g for 5 min.

  1. Start/Finish time for centrifugation was    11 : 25  am 




9\. Aspirated the supernatant(s).

10\. Resuspended pellet(s) in     2    mL     Growth     media   11  : 45  am

11\. Aliquoted       10ul   of resuspended cells into a microcentrifuge tube
for cell count.

12\. Performed a cell count using the haemocytometer and recorded the cell
count data in the Google Doc spreadsheet: Cell Count Spreadsheet or cell count
widget below

  1. Total cell number was:       2536000      

  2. Volume of cell suspension required for subculture was:      1.9mL       

  3. Cell density per vessel:     7000/cm2       




13\. Transferred       1990    µl of cell suspension to the pre-warmed      60
mL Growth media:    11  : 58   am

14\. Transferred cell suspension into the      2x T175      vessel.

16\. Transferred vessel(s) to incubate at:

  * [ X]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (avian cells)
