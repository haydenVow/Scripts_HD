Our Garvan contact:

Eric Lam - 0413 683 363

e.lam@garvan.org.au

  1. Send Eric a message with details including:

  * Desired sort date and time (they do 2 daily slots: before midday, and 12-5pm)
  * How many cell lines
  * Mention that we want to sort single cells into 96-well plates
  * Are we using fluorophores (conjugated to antibodies) or just Hoechst/PI (nucleus & live/dead)
  * Provide contact details of which Vowzer will be bringing the cells to/from Garvan

  2. Confirm a time and tell Eric to "lock in" that time slot for confirmation




Fill gelatin-coated plates with Growth Media.

  

Mix 30mL of Conditioned media (st. filtered) + 30mL Fresh growth media

Aliquot 60mL of Fresh growth media

  

  1. Add 50uL/well of fresh Growth Media to columns 1-12 of all 6 plates.
  2. Add 50uL/well of fresh Conditioned:Growth Media (1:1) to columns 13-24 of all 6 plates.
  3. Parafilm plates before closing the lid & tape the plates together for transport. 10:30 AM

  




Prepare FACS buffer

  1. Prepare 10-20mL of FACS buffer (PRF DMEM/F12 + 2% FBS).
  2. Sterile filter through a 0.2µm filter.
  3. Store at 4ºC until needed. 9:29 AM




1\. Prepare cells for FACS by following relevant harvesting protocol.

  2. Once cell pellet in generated after neutralising:
  3. Resuspend pellet in 1-2 mL Growth Media. (can go up to 4-5mL if necessary, just keep in mind Hoechst is 100X so if cell suspension is 5mL, add 50uL of Hoechst in the next step, etc.)
  4. Place the FACS tube cell suspension on ice. 10:47 AM

  

Note* 4mL used (see harvest lab book entry)




Prepare 1 styrofoam boxes to transfer to the Garvan

1 Box with:

  * pre-filled (media) multi-well plates, parafilmed
  * an ice pack, Hoechst (ddH20)
  * extra FACS Buffer
  * the tubes containing cells.
  * A spare 15mL tube to split cell suspension at Garvan (stained/unstained)
