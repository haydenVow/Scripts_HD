Process:  

  1. Aliquoted 10mL of Nuvonis suspension media + 10% FBS (without growth factors) into a 15mL tube
  2. In the BSC, added EGF and IGF1-LR3 to final concentrations of 10ng/mL EGF (1uL) and 50ng/mL IGF LR3 (10uL) to the tube to make up the complete nuvonis media. 
  3. Placed in the bead bath and warm to 37C 
  4. Collected culture 13405 from shaker, and transferred to the BSC
  5. Broke apart clumps in each tube using a P1000 pipette, mixing until a homogeneous suspension was obtained. 
  6. Centrifuged cells for 5min at 400g
  7. Aspirated and discarded 80% spent media from the tube. 
  8. Re-suspended cell pellet.
  9. Took 1 aliquot of 10uL from this suspension to perform cell counts.
  10. Performed trypan blue staining and manual counting with a haemocytometer, 
    1. Cell total = 180,000 in 1mL  
  11. Made up the cell suspension to 10mL using additional prewarmed Complete Nuvonis Suspension Media +10% FBS (including growth factors).
  12. Returned the cells to shake at 210 rpm in incubator 140, 5% CO2, 30 degrees. Culture ID 13405
