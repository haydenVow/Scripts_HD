Procedure


PREPARE DESTINATION VESSELS

  1. Removed adherent and suspension media mixes from the fridge (See FACS preparation lab book entry for this EPIC) 
  2. 8 x 384 well ultra low attachment plates were filled with 50uL of Hycell Cho growth media. 
  3. 2x 384 well adherent plates were filled with 50uL of DMEM/F12 + 20% FBS + 1xP/S growth media. 
  4. 5mL of Hycell Cho growth media was added to 3 x 50mL bioreactor tubes. 
  5. 12mL of DMEM/F12 + 20% FBS + 1xP/S growth media was added to 3 x T75 flasks. 
  6. 384 well plates were parafilmed before closing the lid (sterile-side down, facing wells, as demonstrated in image below) & then lids and plates were parafilmed together (same fashion as is done for fix and stained plates in fridge) for transport to FACS sorting facility. 
  7. Media for bioreactor tubes and flasks were placed in the water bath at 30 degrees to warm.




Passaging of PTEN and PABPC1 knockouts  
  
Cultures 10303 and 10305 were removed from the incubator for passage around
10:50am.  
Plates were transported from the Library lab into the Main lab for passage
since there was no available hood space




PASSAGING OF NUCLEOFECTED CELLS

1\. Took 2 x images of each vessel with microscope on phase setting (4X to
assess confluence)

2\. Aliquoted the required volume of each reagent below, placed all aliquots
to warm in the bead bath for a minimum of 20 minutes prior to use:

  1. TrypLE:  2mL per well 
  2.  dPBS (for neutralising & washing):  4mL per well 

3\. Time that all aliquots were placed in the water bath the warm before use
10:50 am  

Note: if aliquots were placed in water bath at different time, record the time
stamp for each individual solution.

Suspension cultures and adherent cultures were set up prior to 12pm. Passage
started at around 10 am. Cells were later harvested for FACS sorting after
lunch starting at 13:00.  

  * [ST] Cultures 10438, 10439, 10433 and 10434  were passaged starting at 10:30. 
  * [NH] Cultures 10435, 10436 were passaged starting at 11:00, Only Row 1 of culture 10436 was taken for further adherent culture. The rest of the wells were dedicated to a suspension bioreactor tube (50mL)   

  * Culture 10437 was passaged starting at X

The following passaging protocol was followed for each passage of nucleofected
cells from each knockout/control, The supernatant from any wells destined for
suspension culture vessels (as specified above) were also collected instead of
discarded prior to typlisation where applicable. Wells destined for adherent
culture as mentioned above had supernatant collected only after Tryple
incubation. Knockouts were kept in separate tubes.  

* * *

4\.  Removed culture supernatant and washed each well GENTLY with 2mL of dPBS
(warmed).  

5\. removed dPBS wash and added   2  mL tryple to each well, cells were then
incubated at 37˚C for 5 minutes.  

6\. Supernatant was collected into a 50mL tube empty wells were washed with
1.5 ml  of dPBS. dPBS wash was then collected into the same tube containing
trypalised cells.  

7\. Centrifuged at 400 x g for 5 min.  

8\. Aspirated and discarded the supernatant(s).

9\. Resuspended pellet(s) in   2 ml (suspension culture) OR 1 mL (adherent
cultures) OR 1mL (FACS) mL   Hycell Cho + supplements (suspension) OR DMEM/F12
+ 20% FBS + 1X P/S (adherent) OR  PRF DMEM/F12 + 2% FBS (FACS) respectively  

10\. Aliquoted 10uL of cell suspension for counting using a hemocytometer,
mixing 1:1 with Trypan blue.

11\. Cell suspension was counted and the cell concentration and total cell
number was determined for each group in the document below.

  * IGFBP4 (10435 + Row 2 of 10436) : 4,500,000 cells  

  * IGFBP4 (Row 1 of 10436) : 1,356,000 cells  

  * PABPC1 + PTEN (9 wells from 10438, 10439): 4,620,000
  * PABPC1 + PTEN: (3 wells from 10438, 1043): 
  * Control (9 wells from 10433, 10434): 4,140,000
  * Control (3 wells from 10433, 10434); 

  




SETTING UP ADHERENT POOLED CULTURES

  1. For each knockout/control an aliquot of counted *adherent cell suspension (containing 5.25 x 10^6 cells) was transferred to a T75 dish containing 12mL of DMEM/F12 + 20% FBS + 1xPS media prepared earlier.
  2. Plates were left to incubate at 30 degrees, 5% CO2 (incubator #68 ) static. 

  




SETTING UP SUSPENSION POOLED CULTURES

  1. After cell counting of cells destined for suspension cultures, each knockout/control condition was transferred to a 50mL bioreactor tube.
  2. Tubes were left to incubate at 30 degrees, 5% CO2 (incubator # ) shaking at 205 rpm 

  




FACS SORTING SUSPENSION CELLS

  1. Once cell suspensions were counted after passage cells were transferred to a 1.5 mL tube and centrifuged again at 400g for 5 minutes
  2. Supernatant was removed. 
  3. Cells were resuspended in 1mL of FACS buffer per sample
  4. An esky box was packed for transport to the FACS facility 
    1. Pre-filled (medium) multi-well plates (10x384), parafilmed
    2. An ice pack
    3. Extra FACS Buffer prepared earlier. 
    4. Stained and filtered cells from each group. 
    5. 2x 0.22um filter capped tubes. 
  5. Once at the FACS facility: 
    1. Samples were passed though 0.22um filter lids into sample collection tubes
    2. A live dead stain was added to each of the sample tubes. 
    3. Cells from each condition were sorted into 4 x 384 well plates each containing suspension adapted media AND 1x 384 well plate containing adherent media, 1 cell per well  
    4. Time taken to sort all plates: 
  6. Plates were transported back to Vow and moved directly to the incubator at 30 degrees, 5% CO2 (Incubator number # ) 




DNA EXTRACTION

Screening PCR protocol - DNA extraction of adherent CHOMP

1.    Transferred a sample of 100,000 cells from each group into separate 1.5 ml tubes. 

2.    Centrifuged cells down to form a pellet (300g for 5 minutes)

3.    Aspirated off media

4.    Resuspended pellet in 100 ul PBS
