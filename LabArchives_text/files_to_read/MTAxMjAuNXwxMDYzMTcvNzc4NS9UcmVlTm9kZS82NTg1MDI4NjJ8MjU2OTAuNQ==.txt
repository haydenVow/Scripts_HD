The purpose of this test is to identify whether our ZIC1 primer pair for guide
2 is able to amplify the intended section of DNA we're targetting using the
annotated Crocodylus porosus genome. We have had some unusual results with our
ZIC1 primer sets which have not given us confidence that this primer set is
able to give us a consistent amplified sequence. Sequencing on PCR products
using these primer sets have been returned 'messy' (with multiple sequence
signals) by AGRF. Here we are using our old and a new primer set for ZIC1 as
we suspect the old primer set ordered back in January may be defective.

  
GC enhanced primer testing for ZIC1

Primer pair master mixes used for experiment. New primer 10uM solutions were
made from stocks for this experiment, These 10uM solutions were then used for
the experiment below.  

1\. P27 + P28 (both sourced on 18th of Jan)

2\. P27 and P28 (both sourced on 5th of Apr)

3\. P27 (18/1/22) + P28 (5/4/22)

4\. P27 (5/4/22) + P28 (18/1/22)

PCR amplification using BENTOLAB

Removed a frozen cell pellet of CHOMP07 cells from the -20 freezer in the main
lab.

Thawed a 10mL aliquot of QuickExtract then resuspended the cell pellet in
200uL of QuickExtract mix. Aliuoted 25uL of suspension into 8 PCR tubes and
placed them in the bentolab thermocycler then ran the following protocol.

\- 65 degrees C, 5 minutes

\- 98 degrees, 120 seconds

DNA extractions were moved to the fridge in main lab at 4 degrees, labelled as
Wild type (WT) CHOMP. One tube of DNA extract was used for the reactions
below.

  1. Made up a master mix for 2x reactions for primer master mixes outlined above (# of reactions +1).  Below are intended volumes for 1x 25uL reaction.

  2. Obtained 0.2 mL PCR tubes
  3. Added 25μl of respective primer MM to each sample tube as per the table further above.
  4. Added 1μl of wild type CHOMP07 DNA extract to each tube, added 4uL of MilliQ to each tube to make a total reaction volume of 30uL.
  5. Took samples to the PCR machine and set the settings to (melting temp for primers used was 61 degress C).  

  6. To visualize PCR products, made up a 1 % agarose gel in 0.5X TBE buffer (1 tablet + 50mL of 0.5X TBE). 
    1. The following tutorial was followed for setting up the gel electrophoresis station on the BentoLab https://bento.bio/protocol/biotechnology-101/introduction-to-gel-electrophoresis/
  7. Ran the PCR products on the gel using 2uL of loading dye mixed with 5uL of PCR product. Loading order listed below 
    1. Ladder
    2. sample 1
    3. sample 2
    4. sample 3
    5. sample 4

  




## Results

  

Primer combo P27 (5/4/22) and P28 (18/1/22) produce the desired banding.  
  
P28 (5/4/22) and P27 (18/4/22) primers Do not produce desired banding in any
combination.







## Observations

The Quick extract DNA sample used of CHOMP 07 was quite viscous, as a result
it was difficult to tell if 1uL was pipetted, some volumes of DNA template
added may be between 0.5 and 1uL.
