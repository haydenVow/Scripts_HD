Prepare Ammonium iron(III) citrate solution


Note: realised yesterday that because we only have transferrin in-house rather
than holo-transferrin, we are lacking an iron source for our cells. In the
paper where this media is sourced, they mentioned using ammonium iron (III)
citrate along with an iron chelator (tropolone) as a substitute for holo-
transferrin when making a fully protein-free medium. We do not have any
tropolone in-house, however we do have ammonium iron (III) citrate. The paper
states that they added 2.5 uM Fe(III) in the form of ammonium iron (III)
citrate, which works out to be 15 uM of ammonium iron (III) citrate (based on
the Sigma chemical's 1:6 ratio of iron to citrate).  




  1. Added 100 mg of ammonium iron (III) citrate to 10 mL of MilliQ water (10 mg/mL) 
  2. Sterile filtered 


Prepare media aliquots

  1. Added 193.5 mL of CHO-T1-SF medium to 5 x sterile media containers
  2. Added remaining ingredients according to table below
    * Added a different peptone broth (prepared yesterday) to each media aliquot to result in 5 different media types
    * Did not add IGF-1-LR3, EGF, or transferrin to the media, as these compounds are not stable at 2-8'C for longer than 1 week
  3. Stored in fridge at 2-8'C until ready to use
