RELATED TO MILESTONE:  KR2 Generate at least 1 suspension-adapted fibroblast
cell line.

AIM/PURPOSE: To adapt fibroblasts to suspension culture

HYPOTHESIS: We hypothesise that fibroblasts which have not been grown in
adherent culture for long amounts of time will adapt more easily to suspension
culture.

RESULTS SUMMARY: The results of this experiment were confounded by inaccurate
counting data and a lack of replicates. All treatment groups showed rapid loss
of cell viability, with no successful adaptation of fibroblasts to suspension
culture.  

CONCLUSIONS: The hypothesis was not supported; no fibroblasts were
successfully adapted to suspension culture.

NEXT STEPS:

No future experiments will be planned as a result of this experiment. However,
some learnings to improve future suspension trials include:

  1. For future suspension work, use Ca2+ and Mg2+-free basal media to reduce cell aggregation  
  2. Perform 100% feeds instead of 50% feeds to reduce levels of cell debris, thereby enabling more accurate counts and further reducing the incidence of cell clumping 
  3. Add replicates for conditions to gain statistically significant data
