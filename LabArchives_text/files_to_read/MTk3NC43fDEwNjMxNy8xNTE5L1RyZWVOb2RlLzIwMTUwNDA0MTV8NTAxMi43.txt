## Performed by: LL




Reagent preparation:

1\. Aliquotted   10 mL  dPBS for washing

2\. Centrifuged the secondary antibody stock using the benchtop
microcentrifuge for 10 seconds.

3\. Prepared Secondary Antibody mix (pipette from the top/supernatant of
antibody solution):

  2 µL   Secondary #1 (AF555)   (1:1000 ) +  2 µL   Secondary #2 (AF488)
(1:1000) +  1998  uL Blocking Buffer (PBST (0.1% Triton X + dPBS) + 3% BSA)  

If using AlexaFluor secondary antibodies then the max concentration should be
1:500 (typically used at 1:1000)

Pipette-mixed antibody mix and stored refrigerated away from light until
needed.

4\. Prepared DAPI mix:

 1998 uL  dPBS +  2 uL  of DAPI

Vortexed DAPI mix and stored refrigerated away from light until needed.

Process:

1\. Removed plate from fridge (incubated in primary antibodies overnight).

2\. Washed 3 times for 5 min with PBS at RT.

 9:23 - 9:28

 9:29 - 9:33  

 9:34 - 9:39

3\. Incubated the cells with secondary antibody mixture in the dark at RT for
1 hour.  9:40 - 10:40 a/pm

NOTE: from this step onwards protect from the light by wrapping plates in foil
and perform experiment in the dark.
