Our current best candidate to replace Freestyle 293 basal media for our
Nuvonis quail cell line is a mixture of RPMI and HyCellCHO media (see report).
We have found that a 1:1 ratio of the two media enables decent proliferation
of our cells in suspension. We want to further reduce the concentration of
HyCell in our media, with the ultimate objective being a fully RPMI based
media that we can make up in-house. In order to move towards this goal, we
need to determine which factors are necessary to add to RPMI that will enable
it to support proliferation of these cells, as currently RPMI alone is
insufficient (see report). The factors we are going to test include:

Glutamax  
Trace elements B (1000X)  
KSR  
Sodium pyruvate  
RevitaCell  
MEM essential amino acids (50X)  
MEM non-essential amino acids (100X)  
Yeast  
IGF-1-LR3  
EGF  
Putrescine dihydrochloride  
L-Ornithine monohydrochloride
