New culture ID: 13403




NOTES:

\- Significant vibration were detected at 1300 RCF and 2.5L/min flow rate,
following suggestions for TT and ME, RCF was increased to 1500 and flow rate
3.25L/min.

\- Due to high RCF this resulted in high cell death and a watery cell centrate
that had to further centrfuged by benchtop centrifuged.

\- RCF reduced to 1200 RCF for future harvests and flow rate reduced to 2.5
L/min.
