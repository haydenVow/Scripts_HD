Process:

  1. Grabbed the deep well plates containing DSD conditions from the fridge. Placed in the Thermo incubator to warm media. 13:57-14:45
  2. Took culture plate 1 (6613) out of the incubator as well as the deep well plate 1 with warm media. Peeled off the plate seal from the deep well plate.
  3.  Took up 6 tips with a multichannel pipette and slowly aspirated 50% was media (70uL/well) from plate 1, column 2. With the same tip, adding 70uL/well of media from the corresponding deep well plate. i.e. media from plate 1 column 2 of deep well into culture plate 1 column 2. Then changed tips. 
  4. Repeated step 3 for all 10 columns on plate 1.
  5. Resealed the deep well plate with another plate seal. Stored deep well plate in the fridge (4 degrees C).
  6. Repeated steps 2-5 for plates 2 and 3.
  7. Returned vessel to incubate at: 15:19pm
