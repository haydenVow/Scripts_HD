## Feed performed by: Bec Screnci  




Growth Media:

  * [X ]  DMEM/F12 + 20% FBS + 1X P/S
  * [X ]  DMEM/F12 + 20% FBS + 1X P/S + 1:100 Anti-clumping agent
  * [X ]  DMEM/F12 + 20% FBS + 1X P/S + 1:500 Anti-clumping agent
  * [X ]  DMEM/F12 + 20% FBS + 1X P/S + 1:100 RevitaCell




Process:

1\. Place the pre-aliquotted  10 mL  mL of each respective type of Growth
Media into the water bath  14:59 pm

2\. Placed shake tubes in centrifuge and centrifuge at 650 x g for 5 min at
RT.   15:54 - 15:59 pm

Aspirated supernatant from each pellet

Added 1mL of respective growth media to each tube and used a P1000 pipette to
break up cell clumps.

10uL of each culture taken for viability check

Remaining 9mL of each respective media was added afterwards and triturated
with 10mL serological pipette to break up cell clumps for each culture further
and resuspend cells evenly.

4\. Returned 3 x vessel to incubate at:   : pm Shaking at 206 RPM

  * [X ]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (aviary cells)

Observations:

Upon collecting the tubes from the shaking platform, tubes were observed.

1:100 anti-clumping - some cloudiness in media, plus 1 medium and 3 small
clumps floating around

1:500 anti-clumping - some cloudiness in media, plus 5 medium clumps floating
around

1:100 RevitaCell - some cloudiness in media, plus 1 medium clump floating
around

Serum control - very little cloudiness in media and 2 large irregularly shaped
clumps floating around

 100  % media changed on vessel(s)

### Results

  * Results were;
    * [ ]  As Usual (this is a repetitive task)
    * [ ]  Unexpected because...
    * [ X]  Need to be further analysed (this will be graphed along with continual viability and cell count measurements over the course of the experiment to plot cell survival
    * [ ]  Other (.......)
