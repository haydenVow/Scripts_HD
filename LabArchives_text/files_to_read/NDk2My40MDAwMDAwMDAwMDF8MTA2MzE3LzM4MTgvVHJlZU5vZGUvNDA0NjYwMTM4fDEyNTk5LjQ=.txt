Note: Please do a passage for cultures 7725 7935and 7936 and give a 50% feed
to 7972 and 7973. Thanks!

### Process:

For feeds: Heat the following to 30C in the water bath

1. 20mL DMEM + 20% FBS + 1 x PS (for cultures 7972 and 7973)  

For Passage: Heat the following to 30C in the water bath

  1. TrypLE:     7   mL in      1   tubes
  2.  dPBS (for neutralising):     7  mL
  3.  dPBS (for washing):       7 mL
  4. DMEM + 20% FBS + 1 x PS (for culture 7936pellet resuspension):     2    mL
  5. DMEM + 20% FBS + 1 x PS (for culture 7936 seeding)::     30    mL
  6. M199 + 20% FBS + 1 x PS (for culture 7935 and 7936 pellet resuspension):     2    mL
  7. M199 + 20% FBS + 1 x PS (for culture 7935 and 7936 seeding)::     10    mL

Time that all aliquots were placed in the water bath the warmed to 30C before
use   16:37  

Note: if aliquots were placed in water bath at different time, record the time
stamp for each individual solution.




Passage

  1.  Removed vessel(s) 7725 and 7936 from the incubator   16:45   

  2. Washed the vessel(s) with dPBS (warmed).
  3. Added   tryple to each vessel/well and incubated at 30ËšC.
  4. Start/Finish for TrypLE was     16:50-17:00  

  5. Neutralised each well with   dPBS and transferred to   15 mL    tubes.
  6. Centrifuged at 650 x g for 5 min.
  7. Start/Finish time for centrifugation was   17:10-17:15   

  8. Aspirated the supernatant(s).
  9. Resuspended pellet(s) in   1  mL   respective growth   medias
  10.  Aliquoted   10uL  of resuspended cells into a microcentrifuge tube for cell count.
  11. Performed a cell count using the haemocytometer and recorded the cell count data in the Google Doc spreadsheet called 'Cell Count Spreadsheet' (see link below):

SSIBtIylyrBQE5kRX5Z8NtI/edit#gid=0  

    1. Volume of cell suspension required for subculture was:  all
      1. culture 7725: 52K seeded into 6 well plate
      2. culture 7936: 1.8M seeded into 2x T175  

      3. culture 7935: 232K seeded into 1x T25 + 1x well of 6-well plate  

    2. 13\. Incubate at 30C and 5% CO2. 17:55  







For feed

50% media was removed from cultures 7972 and 7972 and replaced with fresh
growth media
