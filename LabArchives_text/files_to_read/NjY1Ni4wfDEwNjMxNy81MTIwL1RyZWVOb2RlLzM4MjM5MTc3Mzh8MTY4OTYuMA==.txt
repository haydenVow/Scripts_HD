Procedure


Prepare plates

  1. Coat 4x384-well plates using 20uL/well of 1% Gelatin solution.  Incubate at room temperature for 10-30 minutes, then aspirate.   10:22 - 1052  
\- NOTE: You can use the Integra multichannel pipette for this - it will fill
up every second well because of how spaced out the tips are, so just fill A1,
A3, A5 etc. in the first dispense then A2, A4, A6 etc. in the next dispense.
Bec knows how to use this if you are uncertain on how to select settings.

  2. Add 50 uL/well of fresh Growth Medium (D/F+20%FBS+1xP/S +10ng/mL FGF) to plates
  3. Parafilm plates before closing the lid (sterile-side down, facing wells, as demonstrated in image below) & then parafilm lids and plates together (same fashion as is done for fix and stained plates in fridge) for transport to Garvan : A/PM

  




Prepare FACS buffer

  1. Prepare 20mL of FACS buffer (PRF DMEM/F12 + 2% FBS).
    1. 400uL FBS + 19.6mL PRF DMEM/F12
  2. Sterile filter through a 0.2 µm filter.
  3. Store at 4ºC until needed. 10:50




Prepare cells for FACS by following relevant harvesting protocol (lab book:

  2. Once cell pellet was generated after neutralising:
    1. Re-suspended pellet in _3_ mL Growth Medium (can go up to 4 - 5mL if necessary, just keep in mind Hoechst is 100 X so if cell suspension is 5 mL, add 50 uL of Hoechst in the next step, etc.)
    2. Placed the FACS tube cell suspension on ice. : 12:36 A/PM

  




Prepare 1 styrofoam boxes to transfer to the Garvan

1 Box with:

  * Pre-filled (medium) multi-well plates, parafilmed
  * An ice pack
  * Hoechst (ddH20) - vial is located in large new fridge in library lab, top shelf of door in 70 mL urine conatiner 
  * Extra FACS Buffer
  * Tube containing cells
