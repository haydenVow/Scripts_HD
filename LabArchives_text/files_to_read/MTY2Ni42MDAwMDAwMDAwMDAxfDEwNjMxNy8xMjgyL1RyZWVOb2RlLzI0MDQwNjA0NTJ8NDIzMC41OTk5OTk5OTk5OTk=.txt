1\. Prepared  2  mL  PBST (0.2% Triton-X)

2\. Prepared  2  mL  blocking buffer: PBST (0.1% Triton-X + PBS) + 3% bovine
serum albumin (BSA). (Kept in the fridge until needed in blocking step)

3\. Prepared Primary Antibody Mix:  5 µL   Primary #1 MyoG (Santa Cruz)
(1:200) +  20 µL   Primary #2 MF20 (DSHB)   (1:50  ) +  975  uL Blocking
Buffer

Pipette-mixed antibody mix and stored refrigerated away from light until
needed.

Process:

Permeabilise

1\. Removed PBS from each well.

2\. Added  250 µL PBST (0.2% Triton-X) to each well for 15 min:  14:23 - 14:38
pm

3\. Aspirated PBST for each well.




Blocking

1\. Added  250 µL of blocking buffer (3% BSA in PBST [0.1% Triton-X]) and
incubate for 45 minutes - 1hr at RT. (no more than 1 hour):   14:41 - 15:34
a/pm




Single/Simultaneous Primary Antibody staining

1\. Removed blocking buffer from each well.

2\. Incubated cells with primary antibody at 4ºC overnight:   15:36 a/pm

3\. Parafilmed plates and stored at 4ºC in "Staining" fridge in main lab.

Observations/Summary:

  * ### Five wells primary stained for MyoG and MF20

  




### Results:

  * Results were;
    * [ ]  As Usual (this is a repetitive task)
    * [ ]  Unexpected because...
    * [X]  Need to be further analysed
    * [ ]  Other (.......)
