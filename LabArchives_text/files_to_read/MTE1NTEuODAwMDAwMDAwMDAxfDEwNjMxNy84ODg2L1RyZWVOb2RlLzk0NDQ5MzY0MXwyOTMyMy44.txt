Process:

Aliquoted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then
placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath 30 minutes prior to use

  1. Obsereved cultures under the microscope and recorded confluence in the table above. 
  2. Imaged cultures (captured in mia)
  3. TrypLE:   60    mL 
  4. dPBS (for washing & neutralising)   120   mL
  5. Growth media (for pellet resuspension and seeding):    2L OptiPRO + 4mM Glutamax  
  6. Washed the flask(s) with 10mL dPBS.
  7. Added   10   mL tryple to each vessel/well and incubated at 37˚C for   10     min.
  8. Neutralised with   10mL    dPBS (warmed) and combined cell suspension into a     50ml  tubes.
  9. Centrifuged at 500 x g for 5 min.
  10. Aspirated+ discarded supernatant
  11. Resuspended pellet(s) in      1-10  mL media.  
Performed a cell count using the haemocytometer and recorded the cell count
data in widget or the Google Doc spreadsheet called 'Cell Count Spreadsheet'

  12. Total cell number was:  
MUSCO: 7,080,000  
BOBBO: 49,440,000  
KINGO: 1,604,000

  13. Re-seeded cells as per table above. 

  14. Transferred flasks to incubate at 37ºC, 5% CO2, library lab incubator #77
