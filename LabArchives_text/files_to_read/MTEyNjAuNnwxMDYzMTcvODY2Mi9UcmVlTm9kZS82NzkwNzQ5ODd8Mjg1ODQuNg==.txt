Process:

  1. Aliquotted  400 mL  mL of  each GM listed in table above. 
  2. Placed in water bath for 30 minutes
  3. Added 50ul 0.05ug/ul TGF-B1 to 200ml GM
  4. Removed   100% of supernatant from vessel and placed waste media in a -80C freezer for future analysis
  5. Replaced with  13 mL (per well/per vessel) of  growth media (listed above) 
  6. Returned vessel to incubate at:   14: 00
