Prepare guides/cas9/Cas9 electroporation enhancer

  1. Resuspend guide RNAs in 1 x TE buffer to a final concentration of 44 uM (store at -20) (PTEN guide 1 45.3982 ul, PABPC1 guide 1 45.4194 ul), (buffer + gRNA mixes were placed in the fridge while other components were being mixed)
  2. Make up Cas9 mix. Below is a 1 x mix for 1 well, multiply by number of wells you intend to make x 1.25 to get total volume required for experiment.

ComponentAmount (uL) 1 x mixAmount (uL) x45  
Alt-R Cas9 (62 uM stock)0.313.5  
Buffer R0.29  
Total volume0.522.5  
  
  
3\. Make up the Cas9 + guide mix. Below is a 1 x mix for 1 well, multiply by
number of wells you intend to make x 1.25 to get total volume required for
experiment.

sgRNA in TE buffer (44uM)0.5 8  
Cas9 in R buffer (36 uM from above)0.58  
Total volume116  
  
4\. Incubate mix for 10-20 min, (tubes were left in the bench hood for 10
minutes to incubate from 12:26)

5\. while incubating, prepare the electroporation enhancer

  1. resuspend in 1 x TE to get to a 100 uM stock solution (first use only)
  2. make up mix for each experiment of a 10.8 uM solution using 1 x TE buffer. Below is a 1 x mix for 1 well, multiply by number of wells you intend to make x 1.25 to get total volume required for experiment.

Prepare Cells for nucleofection

  1. 6 well plates were prepared to receive nucleofected cells. 3 wells were prepared per condition. The number of wells required were filled with 3 mL of DMEM/F12 + 20% FBS WITHOUT ANTIBIOTICS! 
  2. 6 well plates were placed in the incubator (30 degrees, 5% CO2) to warm plates with media [11:13am]. 
  3. Cells used were of a low passage number, thawed and out of frozen storage for at least 3 days and appear happy and live. [Cell culture ID:    10113, 10109, 10114, 10112, 10110, 10108       ] (we ended up requiring cell cultures that were only thawed on tuesday 18-1-21 as we were short on cells. Therefore we used the cells thawed for nucleofection round 2)
  4. Media was removed from cells, PBS washed with 10 mL per flask and triplised with 10 mL tryple per flask
  5. tryple was neutralised with     10  mL PBS per flask
  6. Cells were placed in a falcon tube 
  7. cell count was performed [Cell count 3,336,000 cells/mL)
  8. The number of cells required for the experiment was determined. 0.5 x 10^5 cells were requried per well. Each condition therefore required 1.5 x 10^6. However we prepared extra in case of pipetting errors. Therefore 2 x 10^6 cells per condition were prepared. with a total of 12 conditions (6 per gene) we prepared 24 x 10^6 cells. 
  9. The number of mL of cells required for the number of cells you need was pipetted out. In this case we had just enough cells and therefore the entire solution was used [ 7mL used for experiment]
  10. Cells were centrifuged for 10 mins at 300g at room temp [time in centrifuge 11:50]
  11. Supernatant was removed
  12. The pellet was resuspended in     3    mL 1x PBS 
  13. The       3   mL solution was transferred into     3    epindorf tubes
  14. The cells were centrifuged at 300g for 5 mins at room temp [time in centrifuge    12:10 ] 
  15. The supernatant was removed from each tube. It is important to remove as much as possible. Use a 1 mL tip to remove most of the supernatant and then switch to a 200 uL pipette to remove a little more if necessary. Do not disturb the pellet.
  16. The pellet was resuspended in    360     uL R buffer (120 ul per epindorf tube) (7.5uL R buffer per 5 x 10^5 cells)
  17. To each epindorf tube the following mix was prepared:

17.The nucleofection machine was set up and 6 well plates retrieved from
incubator

18.The neon tip was inserted into the mix from above and draw up cell mix

19\. The cells were electroporated with the 3 conditions below
