### Process:

1\. Took image of vessel with microscope on phase setting. Include link in
image section - Note: it is expected that the cells will be ready for a
passage and freeze - ie not seeding. If it is not confluent enough, dont
passage

3\. Aliquotted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then
placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath for a minimum of 20 minutes
prior to use:

  1. TrypLE:    200     mL 
  2.  dPBS (At 37 degrees for washing):    200   mL 
  3.  dPBS (at RT neutralising):     200    mL 
  4. dPBS for re-suss and freezing    50    mL (Just prepare up to 300 mL of PBS and place in the fridge. During the centrifuge step, place in the freezer to chill.) 

Time that all aliquots were placed in the water bath the warm before use
10:56   am

Note: if aliquots were placed in water bath at different time, record the time
stamp for each individual solution.




4\. Removed vessel(s) from the incubator     13:24  pm

5\. Washed the vessel(s) with dPBS (warmed).

6\. Added     200     mL tryple to each vessel/well and incubated at 37ËšC.

  1. Start/Finish for TrypLE was     13:40 - 13:57  pm 

7\. Neutralised with     200     dPBS and combined cell suspension into 2 x
250 ml    tube.

8\. Centrifuged at 650 x g for 5 min.

  1. Start/Finish time for centrifugation was     14:15-14:20  pm




9\. Aspirated the supernatant(s).

10\. Resuspended pellet(s) in    6  mL   cold PBS    14:35  pm

11\. Aliquoted      10 ul    of resuspended cells into a microcentrifuge tube
for cell count.

12\. Performed a cell count using the haemocytometer and recorded counts in
"Seed Calculator" widget (see below):

  




Freeze cells

  1. Weigh 6 x 15 mL tubes and record weight 
  2. Wash cell suspension with additional PBS and divide into the 6 x 15 mL tubes - 3 containing 2/3 of the cells and the other 3 containing 1/3 of cells. 
  3. Centrifuge tubes and remove as much of the supernatant 
  4. Weight tunes containing cell pellet and record the pellet weight on the tube. Label as: cell line myoblast, weight of cells and the number of tube 
  5. Place samples in the - 80 freezer in main lab.
