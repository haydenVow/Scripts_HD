## Completed by: VP


Aim/Purpose


  * To pilot and characterise the tech transfer process for Nuvonis suspension cells in 25:75 Hycell:RPMI media
  * To compare the growth rate of Nuvonis cells in BIF UTS facility compared to growth rates recorded at Vow.


Hypothesis


It is expected that cell proliferation rates and overall health (indicated by
cell morphology) should be comparable compared to the same cell line cultured
at Vow


Technical Gap


Vow has successfully received the Nuvonis suspension line cells from parent
company Nuvonis and have successfully completed a tech transfer to culture the
cells in house. However, Vow has not yet trialled the tech transfer process
from Vow lab to another lab. This will become necessary if Vow engage Esco
Aster as a manufacturer of cells in Singapore. Vow also intend to perform
bioreactor optimisation experiments at BIF UTS using the small, parallelised
bioreactor system, AMBR250 (Sartorius). It will be necessary to observe
comparable growth and performance of the cells in the facility before using
the same cells in experiments to ensure data are representative.


Method/Procedure


See link to work schedule

Growth media:

1) Freestyle 293 medium supplemented with:

• Difco Yeast Extract UF, 1g/l: add 10 ml YE stock (100g/l) per liter medium

• L-Ornithine monohydrochloride, 20 mg/l; add 1 ml stock (20 mg/ml) per liter
medium

• Putrescine dihydrochloride, 20 mg/ml; add 1 ml stock (20 mg/ml) per liter
medium

• IGF-1 LONG R3, 50 μg/l; add 50 μl stock (1 mg/ml) per liter medium

• EGF, 10 μg/l; add 10 μl stock (1 mg/ml) per liter medium

• Anti-clumping agent, 1:100; add 10 ml stock per liter medium

  

2) 25:75% Hycell:RPMI medium supplemented with:

• Difco Yeast Extract UF, 1g/l: add 10 ml YE stock (100g/l) per liter medium

• L-Ornithine monohydrochloride, 20 mg/l; add 1 ml stock (20 mg/ml) per liter
medium

• Putrescine dihydrochloride, 20 mg/ml; add 1 ml stock (20 mg/ml) per liter
medium

• IGF-1 LONG R3, 50 μg/l; add 50 μl stock (1 mg/ml) per liter medium

• EGF, 10 μg/l; add 10 μl stock (1 mg/ml) per liter medium

• Poloxamer-188; add x g stock per liter medium

  

Process:

  * transport cryovials to BIF UTS on dry ice
  * thaw cells as per Nuvonis tech transfer SOP (ULA plate, spin out of DMSO, and then transfer to E125 shake flask) in Freestyle media
  * expand cells in Freestyle media
  * wean cells onto target media (25:75)
    * 1:1 target:thaw
    * 3:1 target: thaw
    * 1:0 target:thaw
  * bank cells in 100% target media at BIF
  * continue stock of cells in E500 + E125 satellite flasks for AMBR250 experiments (separate EPIC)
