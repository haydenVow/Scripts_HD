Perform feed using below volumes:




## Feed performed by:  




Process:

1\. Place the pre-aliquotted  10 mL  mL of each respective type of Growth
Media into the water bath   11:20

2\. Placed shake tubes in centrifuge and centrifuge at 650 x g for 5 min at
RT.   11:45-11:50

Aspirated supernatant from each pellet

Added 1mL of respective growth media to each tube and used a P1000 pipette to
break up cell clumps.

Remaining 9mL of each respective media was added afterwards and triturated
with 10mL serological pipette to break up cell clumps for each culture further
and resuspend cells evenly.

4\. Returned vessel to incubate at:   12:10 pm , shaking at 206rpm  

  * [X ]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (aviary cells)

  

  * Incubator (#67 ), Lab [Library]

* * *

Notes:

Despite repeated mixing after addition of 1mL with the P1000 and then again
with the addition of 9mL of media and mixing using the 10mL serological, some
clumps still remain in solution. These pin head specs of debris could not be
broken apart and were present in all 4 tubes.

Pellets were also very loose after spinning at 650 for 5 minutes, It could be
useful to use some dPBS to boost the volume prior to spinning to ensure the
pellets are tightly formed and not easily disturbed during supernatant
aspiration.




### Results

  * Results were;
    * [ ]  As Usual (this is a repetitive task)
    * [ ]  Unexpected because...
    * [ X]  Need to be further analysed (this will be graphed along with continual viability and cell count measurements over the course of the experiment to plot cell survival
    * [ ]  Other (.......)
