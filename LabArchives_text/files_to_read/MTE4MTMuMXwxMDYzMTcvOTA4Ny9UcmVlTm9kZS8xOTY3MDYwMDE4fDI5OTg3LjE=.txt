Passaged remaining clones in 24 well plates.  
  
Briefly

  1. Culture media was removed from each clone that appeared >90% Confluent 
  2. 1mL of dpBS was added to wash the cells 
  3. dPBS was removed and cells were then treated with 200uL of TRYPLE-EDTA
  4. Cells were incubated at 30 degrees for 10 minutes to detach cells
  5. Cells were removed from incubation, mixed by pipetting and 40uL of Tryple volume was taken from each clone and added to a new fresh 24 well containing 1mL of DMEM/F12 + 20% FBS + 1xP/S growth media. 
  6. Cells were returned to incubate at 30 degrees, 5% CO2. 

1mL of fresh growth media was added back to the remaining 160uL of Tryple
volume to neutralise the tryple in an attempt to investigate whether the cells
would re-adhere to the culture ware. This is incase we would like to propogate
the previous population in the future should the need arise.

28/7/22

\- The original cells containing 160uL of remaining tryple showed signs of re-
attachment to their culture ware after addition of fresh 1mL of growth media.
This means we could propogate the cells in the same culture dish over time
which could be more effective and save culture ware in the long run.
