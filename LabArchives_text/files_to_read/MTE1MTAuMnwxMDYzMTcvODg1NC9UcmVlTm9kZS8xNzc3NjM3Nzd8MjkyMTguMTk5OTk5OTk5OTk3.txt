Methods


  1. Remove cultures from the incubator.
  2. Take an image of each well at 4X Magnification, Phase for later qualitative analysis. 
  3. Remove growth media
  4. PBS wash each plate with 5mL of growth media.
  5. PBS wash each plate a second time with 5mL of growth media 
  6.  Fill both plates with 6mL of 4% PFA.
  7. Parafilm and place in the 4C Fixing an Staining Fridge. 14:45


Observations/Summary:


### Scaffold cultures 12663 and 12664 were harvested by removing growth media,
washing, and then finally fixing in 4% PFA and placing in a 4C Fridge.
