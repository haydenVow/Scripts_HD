Prepare materials for thaw and seed:

1\. Aliquotted the required volume of each reagent in the table above. Growth
media (for seeding):   60 mL in  specimen jar and added growth factors

  
2\. Added media to water bath and incubated at 37degC

Time that aliquot was placed in the incubator to warm before use:   10:45  

3\. Added media to 6-WPs and incubated at 37degC in incubator to equilibrate
media (as per SOP, attached).

Time that aliquot was placed in the incubator to warm before use:   11:00  

  




## Thaw and seed vial:

2\. Collected the cryovial from Liquid Nitrogen storage & place in foam
floater in water bath for 5 min   \-  

Location where cryovial was collected from:

Vial details:   2  cryovials at   7.5M cells each for a total of    15M  cells

Brew

Tower/Bucket # 5

Box/Cane # 5  

Vial location:D7, D8  

Vial ID(s): 14004,14005  

`4. Ethanol sprayed & transferred the vial(s) to the BSC.`

`5.  Added  500 µL of Growth Media (to generate a total volume of 1mL in the
cryovial) to the cryovial, resuspended the cell suspension gently to reduce
osmotic shock. `

`6. Collected the entire 1mL of cell suspension & transfer into the pre-warmed
tube of Growth Media. `

`7. Using a 10mL serological pipette, resuspended & distributed the cells into
ultra-low attachment plate for incubation overnight  
`

`9. Transfered flask/plate(s) to incubate at: `

  * [x]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (aviary cells)

Incubator location: #159 main lab (Eppendorf incubator, top)

Shaking speed: 0 RPM - static incubation required overnight




Seeding Density

Density:  ~300 000 cells/mL

Total number of cells: ~15M




SOPs used:
