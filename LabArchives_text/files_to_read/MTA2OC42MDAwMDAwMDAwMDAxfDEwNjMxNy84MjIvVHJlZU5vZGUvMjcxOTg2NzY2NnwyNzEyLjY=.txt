Process:

1\. Aliquotted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then
placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath for a minimum of 20 minutes
prior to use:

  1. TrypLE:    20   mL in   1x 50 mL    tube
  2. Times that all aliquots were placed in the water bath to warm before use   16:50

Note: if aliquots were placed in water bath at different times, record the
time stamp for each individual solution.




2\. Added    10   mL tryple to each vessel/well and incubated at 37ËšC for    5
min.

3\. Weigh empty falcon tubes prior to adding cell suspension

  1. TGF (6557) 12.670 g
  2. Vit C (6555) 12.863 g

4\. Aspirate cell suspension and fibroblast sheets/cells

5\. Centrifuged at 650 x g for 5 min

  1. Start/Finish time for centrifugation was  17:35  \-  17:40   




6\. Aspirated the supernatant(s)

7\. Weigh falcon tubes containing fibroblast cells

  1. TGF-B (6557) 12.874 g
  2. Vit C (6555) 13. 020 g

Weight of pellets:

  1. TGF-B (6557) 0.204 g
  2. Vit C (6555) 0.339 g

Observations/Summary:

\- After approximately 5 minutes of treatment with tryple cells in both
conditions began to lift off the flask surface and formed thin sheets.

\- Sample treated with Vitamin C held its shape well and looked like a thin
sheet. Could hold it's shape whilst being continuously aspirated and dispensed
from a serological pipette.

\- Sample treated with TGF-B broke apart with moderate shaking whilst still in
the T175 flask. Had a honeycomb like structure. Completely dissolved into
smaller aggregates with a single aspiration and dispense cycle with a
serological pipette.

  * Results were;
    * [ ]  As Usual (this is a repetitive task)
    * [x]  Unexpected because... did not expect it
    * [ ]  Need to be further analysed
