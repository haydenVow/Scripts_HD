Samples:

1x Gelatin gelatex scaffold

1x Zein gelatex scaffold

1x Freeze-dried agarose sample

  
  
  
Fix and DAPI process:

  1. Place the scaffolds into a new 24-well plate (does not matter if TC treated or non-treated)
  2. Wash samples gently (so as not wash away cells) with PBS (enough to cover each sample) for 5 min 15:00-15:05
  3. Repeat previous wash step for a second wash   15:06-15:11
  4. Cover samples in 4% PFA for 15 min ,   15:12-15:27
  5. Add 1ul / ml DAPI in PBS, incubate in the dark 5 min , 15:28-15:33
    1. Note - protect plate from light, if background noise is high try for additional wash steps
  6. Wash samples 2x PBS 5 min,  15:35-15:40 15:41-15:46
  7. Replace PBS in wells with fresh PBS `15:47`
  8. Plate parafilmed and stored in the biomaterials fridge overnight for future imaging.

Observations

Gelatin: Scaffold was firm with good structural integrity and was easily
transferred to a new plate with tweezers. Scaffold was opaque and brown in
colour.

Zein: Scaffold had broken into several pieces which had to be moved
individually with tweezers. T pieces themselves were firm, and had likely
broken due to cracking rather than dissolving. Opaque, yellowish white in
colour.

Agarose: The agarose sample was a very soft jelly. It was not possible to pick
up the scaffold with tweezers as the gripping force broke the scaffold.
Instead, it had to be moved with a spatula. The gel was transparant.
