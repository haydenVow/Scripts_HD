### Plates to feed are located in the top incubator in the library lab:

Culture IDs:

### 6368-DOLLY12-Sheep P8-1of2

### 6370-DOLLY12-Sheep P8-2of2

### Feed (2 x Diff Plates):

  1. Inspect both plates under the Primo, 10x objective, phase and capture and image of all 6 wells.
  2. Proceed with feed below on one set of the 2 plates.
  3. Warm up 1 mL of E6 and DMEM/F12 + 2% HS + 1X P/S for 15 minutes. 11:37 - 11:52
  4. Transfer the media to a reservoir in the BSC before feeding for easy handling using the multichannel pipette.
  5. One plate was incubated while other was fed.
  6. Removed  `100` % of supernatant from plate(s). (aspirate only until there is slightly enough liquid to cover the base of the well instead of the whole 100uL to avoid leaving the cells to dry).
  7. Replaced with  `0.150` mL (per well/per flask) of  `E6 and DMEM/F12 + 2% HS + 1X P/S`  media to  of each plate. Note: E6 in the top 3 wells and DMEM/F12 + 2% HS + 1X P/S in the bottom 3 wells. Use fresh tips only in the new media.
  8. Returned flask to incubate at: 12:00  

    * [x]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
    * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (aviary cells)
  9. Repeat the feeding process for Plate 2.
