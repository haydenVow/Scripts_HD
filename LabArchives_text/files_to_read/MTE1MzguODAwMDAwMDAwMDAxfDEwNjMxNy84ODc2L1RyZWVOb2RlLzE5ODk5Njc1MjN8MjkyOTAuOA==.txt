### Process:






4\. Aspirated and discarded media from the flask

5\. Washed the vessel(s) with 10mL dPBS (room temp)

6\. Discarded wash then added    10     mL tryple to each vessel/well and
incubated at 30ËšC, 5% CO2 for 12 minutes.  

7\. Neutralised with     10     dPBS and combined cell suspension into a
1x50mL    tubes 20mL total.  

Took 20uL of each resuspension for a cell count as per instructions below.




CELL COUNT

12\. Performed 3 cell counts using the haemocytometer and recorded the cell
count data in the Google Doc spreadsheet: Cell Count Spreadsheet or cell count
widget below.

Cell total = 4960000  

  1.    Volume of cell suspension required for subculture from cultures was 4.00 mL  

    1. 4.9 mL of cell suspension was transferred to 30 mL of growth media inside a fresh T175 flask
    2. Cell density per vessel:    7000 cells/cm^2      (1225000)
    3. Flask was transferred to incubate at 30 degrees 5% CO2, incubator 68
