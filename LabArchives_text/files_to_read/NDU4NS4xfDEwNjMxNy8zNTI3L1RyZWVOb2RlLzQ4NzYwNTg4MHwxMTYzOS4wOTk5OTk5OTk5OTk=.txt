Process location: Vow (6 Ralph St) Culinary Centre area.  
Area prepared and cleaned prior to processing of the tissue by Michael
Medynskyj using 70% ethanol (x2 wipe-downs of all bench areas).

  

Polystyrene box was opened by Michael Medynskyj, photographs were taken of the
tissue for records. It was then noticed upon manual manipulation of the tissue
pieces that they were both frozen solid.

The samples were placed back into the culinary centre fridge (ID #56) at 11:19
am.

  

After a discussion on Slack (#project-liger channel), it was decided to
attempt processing from one of the tissue pieces that was received after it
has thawed in the fridge overnight. The tissue is too frozen for biopsy
extraction today, so some thawing is necessary before this can happen.

Piece kept at 2-8C overnight (identifier used is the total weight of the
sample): 0.824g

Piece stored at -20C (identifier used is the total weight of the sample):
0.842g - stored in tall silver ESATO brand freezer in the culinary centre (no
ID assigned).
