Process:

1\. Aliquotted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then
placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath for a minimum of 20 minutes
prior to use:

  1.  TrypLE:  60 mL in | 1x 70 mL pot | 
  2.  dPBS (for neutralising)  120  mL in | 1x 120 mL pot | 
  3.  Growth media (for pellet resuspension):   1 mL in | 5x 15 mL | tubes 
  4.  Time that all aliquots were placed in the water bath to warm before use:  10:46

Note: if aliquots were placed in water bath at different times, record the
time stamp for each individual solution.




2\. Washed the flask(s) with dPBS.

3\. Added | 10 |mL tryple to each vessel/well and incubated at 37ºC for | 20 |
min

  1.  Start/Finish time for TrypLE was:   11:25 - 11:45
  2.  Note that fibroblasts typically require 15-18 minutes of tryple incubation. 

4\. Neutralised with | 10 mL | dPBS (warmed) and combined cell suspension into
a | 5x 50 mL | tubes.

5\. Centrifuged at 650 x g for 5 min

  1.  Start/Finish time for centrifugation was:   11:51 - 11:56




6\. Aspirated the supernatant(s).

7\. Resuspend pellet(s) in | 1 |mL | respective growth | media.

8\. Performed a cell count using the haemocytometer and recorded the cell
count data in the Google Doc spreadsheet called 'Cell Count Spreadsheet' (see
link below):

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1DPzKubYxfHmWogVPihC-
SSIBtIylyrBQE5kRX5Z8NtI/edit#gid=0

9\. Total cell number was:

Condition 6:  | 2,724,000 |

Condition 7:  | 3,336,000 |

Condition 8:  | 4,464,000 |

Condition 9:  | 4,200,000 |

EMEM control:   | 8,550,000 |

10\. Calculate the required volume cell suspension & freeze medium to generate
a concentration of ~2E6 (2M) cells/mL. ~1 million fibroblasts per cryovial
should be frozen.




11\. Prepared  5 mL Freeze Medium: (FBS + 10% DMSO). ID M7933  

Stored at 4ºC until use to keep chilled.

12\. Centrifuged cells at 650 x g for 5 min.  13:08 - 13:13

Whilst centrifuge is spinning, prepared & printed vial labels, labelled
cryovials.




13\. Aspirated supernatant carefully, taking care not to disturb the pellet.

14\. Resuspended the pellet in | 1 |mL freeze media (chilled, to reduce DMSO
toxicity).

15\. Aliquotted | 1000 |µL into | 5 | x cryovials (already labelled).

16\. Tightened the lids & transfer the cryovials to a Mr. Frosty immediately
into the -80ºC freezer. 13:26

17\. Allow the cells to freeze for at least 18-24 hours before transferring to
Liquid Nitrogen storage.
