  1. Took 1 x 560 uL samples from each culture (2 x technical reps/flask).
  2. Performed counts using Vicell (560 uL/sample):

  3. We decided to use the cells from this flask to seed the Nuvonis waste media experiment in CHO. If more data on 100% CHO is needed, we can always refer to Lily's experiments.
  4. Aliquoted the following mL of cell suspension into 10 x 15 mL tubes:

  5. Centrifuged the tubes @ 500 xg for 5 minutes.
  6. After centrifugation, aspirated the supernatant and resuspended cell pellet in 20 mL of medium.
  7. Seeded E-125 with cell suspension.
  8. Replaced E125 in incubator at 37'C, 5% CO2, 120 RPM
