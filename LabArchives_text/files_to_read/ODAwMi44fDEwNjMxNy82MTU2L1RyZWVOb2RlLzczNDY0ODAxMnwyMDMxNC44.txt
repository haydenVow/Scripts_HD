Background  
As crocodile has been earmarked to be Vows launch product, large numbers of
F_CHOMP cells are currently being used by both for both production and R&D. A
WCB of 746M F_CHOMP09 fibroblasts cells was recently generated, but was
exhausted within 2 months due to the unexpectedly high cell requirements of
the Production and Science teams during that period. See lab book here

An additional, much larger F_CHOMP09 WCB is therefore required. Here, we aim
to produce a F_CHOMP09 WCB of â‰¥ 2billion cells, which we estimate will be
sufficient to carry us through to the next quarter.  
  
Details of the initial primary cell isolation and culture of of the F_CHOMP09
cell line can be found here
