Harvest 13x 5CS


Procedure

### Cell Harvest

  1. Turn on water bath and set temperature to 37C.
  2. Take the flasks for harvest and observe under the microscope at 4x objective for even cell distribution . Refer to VSOP-006. Take 2-3 images per flask.
  3. Aliquot required volume of dPBS (37C), dPBS (ambient temp) and TrypLE in separate sterile pots.  Refer to Table below for required volume.
  4. Place aliquots in pre-warmed water bath and leave for ~20 minutes or until warmed. Note: Ensure TrypLE is thoroughly warmed.
  5. Transfer aliquots and flasks required for harvest into the BSC.
  6. Collect growth media and loose aggregates from each flask.
  7. Wash with warmed dPBS, then collect this also.
  8. Add TrypLE to each of the flasks. Mix thoroughly to ensure coverage of the surface area.
  9. Place in the incubator at 37C. After 10 minutes, remove flasks and observe for 95-100% dissociation of cells. Incubate further until maximum dissociation level is reached.  
     NOTE: The flasks must be removed from the incubator within 18 minutes of initial incubation of TrypLE containing flasks
  10. Aspirate the TrypLE solution and collect into 250mL centrifuge tubes.
  11. Add ambient temperature dPBS to each flask as a final wash. To effectively remove remaining cells adhered to the flasks, mix thoroughly and then pour the dPBS into 250mL centrifuge tubes.
  12. Centrifuge at 700 x g for 5 minutes.````
  13. Meanwhile remove aggregates from collected growth media and dPBS via carefully aspiration with a serological pipette and place them into a 250mL centrifuge tube.
  14. Centrifuge this also at 700 x g for 5 minutes.
  15. Gently remove centrifuge tubes from the machine, ensuring not to disturb the cell pellets. Aspirate as much supernatant as possible from the tubes. Discard supernatant. Remove as much remaining supernatant with a 1mL pipette.

### Re-pellet and Weigh Final Yield

  1. Label and Record the weight of 1 sterile centrifuge tube and set aside. Record details in Widget.  
  2. Add growth media to each centrifuge tube and resuspend cells. Refer to the table below for the required amount of growth media to be added.
  3. Combine all resuspended cells into the weighed centrifuge tube. 
  4. Wash all empty centrifuge tubes with growth media and add this to the centrifuge tube containing the resuspended cells. 
  5. Centrifuge at 700 x g x 5 minutes. 
  6. Aspirate the supernatant from the tube. Remove as much remaining supernatant with a 1mL pipette.
  7. Record the final weight of the cell pellet. Enter details in Widget. 
  8. Immediately provide to the food team for testing.

5CS Experimental Group Observations:

Group 1:

  * 9535 - still fully adhered except one layer is 95% adhered
  * 9536 - still all fully adhered
  * 9534 - still all fully adhered

Group 2:

  * 9523 - 4 layers peeled and 1 layer still fully adhered
  * 9525 - 3 layers peeled and 2 layers still fully adhered

Group 3:

  * 9527 - 4 layers peeled and 1 layer 90% adhered
  * 9526 - all layers peeled

Group 4:

  * 9528 - all still fully adhered
  * 9529 - all still fully adhered except 1 layer is at 90% adhered

Group 5:

  * 9531 - 3 layers peeled (fresh, possibly overnight) and 1 layer still 80% adhered [the 1 adhered layer came off after some vigorous shaking]
  * 9530 - 3 tightly rolled up aggregates and 1 layer still 80% adhered

Group 6:

  * 9532 - everything still fully adhered
  * 9533 - 4 aggregates and 1 layer still fully adhered (~95%) [last adhered layer came off with vigorous shaking]

  

Group 1 Bulk 10CS observations:

  * Majority of the flasks in the thermo are still fully adhered. There some layers in random flasks that are fully peeled but no 10CS is peeled to completion. There are only a few that have majority (~80%) peeled.
  * This could be due to the fact that they are at P5 as they were seeded from a previous batch
  * Due to the lack of peeling we have decided to harvest all flasks today and remove the attached layers with TrypLE. There is not much benefit in extending these flasks further because they will extend past our cutoff date and there is currently not enough media for future feeds and the media usage would not be worth it.
