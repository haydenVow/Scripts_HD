AIM/PURPOSE: To determine the optimal carrier candidate for this cell line, in
order to optimise cell mass growth when grown in a adherent carrier based
bioreactor system

HYPOTHESIS: The macro carriers will show greater proliferation but minimal
cell mass recovery, with the inverse true for micro carriers.

RESULTS SUMMARY: TBD

CONCLUSIONS: TBD

NEXT STEPS: TBD
