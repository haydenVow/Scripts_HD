Prep of growth media: NOT REQUIRED FOR THIS PASSAGE  

1\. Prep growth media mixes and store at 4'C

*Growth Media: RPMI + 5% FBS + 1X P/S + hydrolysate (5g/L)

In order to make media with hydrolysates at 5g/L just add 5 mL of the
hydrolysate concentrate to 100 mL of growth media.

Process:

1\. Aliquotted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then
placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath for a minimum of 20 minutes
prior to use:

  1. TrypLE:    17   mL in  1x 50 mL  tube  14:51   

  2. dPBS (for neutralising)   34  mL in  1x 50 mL  tube  14:51  

  3. Growth media (for seeding/pellet resuspension):  
 13 mL (Condition 6/7/8/9/) 31 mL (EMEM control)  1 mL for pellet resuspension
14:51  

  4. Times that all aliquots were placed in the water bath to warm before use

Note: if aliquots were placed in water bath at different times, record the
time stamp for each individual solution.




2\. Washed the flask(s) with dPBS.

3\. Added    3   mL tryple to each vessel/well and incubated at 37˚C for   15
min.

Note: Fibroblasts typically require 15-18 minutes of incubation with tryple,
slightly longer than MuSCs.

  1. Start/Finish time for tryple was  15:11  -  15:26   

4\. Neutralised with    3 mL   dPBS (warmed) and combined cell suspension into
separate    15 mL  tubes.

5\. Centrifuged at 650 x g for 5 min

  1. Start/Finish time for centrifugation was  15:45  \-  15:50   




6\. Aspirated the supernatant(s)

7\. Resuspended pellet(s) in      1  mL    growth   media.

8\. Performed a cell count using the haemocytometer and recorded the cell
count data in widget or the Google Doc spreadsheet called 'Cell Count
Spreadsheet' (see link below):

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1DPzKubYxfHmWogVPihC-
SSIBtIylyrBQE5kRX5Z8NtI/edit#gid=0

  




9\. Total cell number was:

Condition 6:    596,000  

Condition 7:  396,000  

Condition 8:  500,000  

Condition 9:  960,000  

EMEM control:  1,388,000  

10\. Seeded ~7k cells per cm2 of the flasks/plates. Note that fibroblasts
prefer to be subcultured closely together.

11\. Volume of cell suspension required for subculture was:  
all uL (Condition 6)  

all uL (Condition 7)  

all uL (Condition 8)  

all uL (Condition 9)  

all uL (EMEM control)

12\. Transferred   required volume of cell suspension to the pre-warmed
12/30 mL Growth Media aliquots.

13\. Transfer cell suspension into (non-gelatin coated)  T75/T175 flasks.

14\. Transfer flask/plate(s) to incubate at:  16:35  

  * [x]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (aviary cells)
