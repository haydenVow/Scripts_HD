Process:

1\. Aliquotted   15mL  mL of  Growth Media into  1 x 50 mL     tube(s). Placed
in water bath  13:20  a/pm

2\. Sampled and stained microcarrier culture

  1.  Sampled 20uL of culture microcarrier suspension into a blank well in a non tissue culture treated 96 well plate. Ensured that sample was taken after swirling on the flat surface of the BSC, while liquid was still in motion.
  2. Added 80uL of dPBS to the well to make up a total volume of 100uL in the well.
  3. Added 2uL of Hoescht stain to well and mixed gently with a P200 pipette, mixing the microcarriers to create an even and spread monolayer but ensuring no bubbles were formed in the process.
  4. Incubated plate in the dark at RT for 15 mins. 13:33 - (approx) 14:00
  5. Imaged Phase and DAPI channels at 10x. 

  

3\. Removed  50  % of supernatant from vessel.

4\. Replaced with  15 mL (per well/per vessel) of  Growth Media  media.

5\. Returned vessel to incubate at: [13:42]
