PCR TESTING

On 14/2/22, DNA was extracted by Sarah and Eva at UNSW using the quick extract
technique. This is the DNA that will be used as a template in this PCR
reaction.




 PCR amplification

  * Ladder loaded on well 1
  * E1 and E2 are FASLG; Loaded on wells 2 and 3
  * E3 and E4 are RIPK1; Loaded on wells 4 and 5
  * E5 and E6 are ZIC1; Loaded on wells 6 and 7
  * Reconstituted FASLG, RIPK1 and ZIC1 primers to 10uM (90 uL MilliQ + 10 uL 100uM primer) prior to beginning the process below. Primer tubes were labelled F for FASLG, R for RIPK1 and Z for ZIC1. Primers with #2 on them refer to reverse primers.

* * *

  1. Remove DNA extractions from the -20 freezer   
  2. Made up a master mix for 1x reaction for each primer set (FASLG, RIPK1, ZIC1). Volumes listed below are intended for 1 reaction, *multiply by the number of reactions you wish to do for each gene of interest + 1 for wild type controls).
  3.   4.  Added 19.1 uL of water instead of 15.1 uL given the high concentration of our extracted DNA.
  5. Obtain 0.2 mL PCR tubes
  6. Add 29μl of respective MM to each tube 
  7.  Add 1μl DNA from the extracted DNA samples to each tube
  8. Take to the PCR machine and set the settings to:
  9.   10.   

  11. To visualize PCR products, make up a 1% agarose gel in 0.5X TBE buffer. 
    1. See this tutorial for setting up the gel electrophoresis station on the BentoLab https://bento.bio/protocol/biotechnology-101/introduction-to-gel-electrophoresis/
  12.  Prepare DNA extractions suspected as good for sequencing through a third party. 

  







## Reference Images:

None of the set of primers amplified the target region. This requires further
troubleshooting.
