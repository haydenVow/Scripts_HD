Equilibrate microcarriers in culture medium before use (SP:1)

  1. Mixed the stock microcarrier (20mg/mL) before aliquoting 8.8 mL.  From this, aliquoted 2.05 mL of stock microcarrier (20mg/mL), into 4x 15 mL tubes - mixing each time before aliquotting.
  2. Labelled the 4 tubes: serum, E89C, E810C, and E811B.
  3. The microcarriers were then allowed to settle and the supernatant (~900uL) removed. 3:35 pm
  4. The microcarriers were resuspended in 2 mL of media (as labelled on the tube. serum = DMEM/F12 + 20% FBS + 1x P/S + 10uM p38i).
  5. Allowed the microcarriers to settle once again and removed supernatant (~900uL).
  6. Resuspended microcarriers in 8 mL of the designated media to make up a suspension of 9mL total.
  7. Added 3mL/well of microcarrier suspension into 2x 6 well plates by mixing each time before aliquoting them out to one well at a time.
  8. The culture vessels were transferred to the incubator (bottom Sanyo - 37 degrees C, 5% CO2) overnight so that the microcarriers and culture medium could equilibrate. `4:50 pm`
