Perform feed using below volumes:




## Feed performed by: Chris  




Growth Media:

  * [X ]  DMEM/F12 + 20% FBS + 1X P/S
  * [X ]  DMEM/F12 + 20% FBS + 1X P/S + 1:100 Anti-clumping agent
  * [X ]  DMEM/F12 + 20% FBS + 1X P/S + 1:500 Anti-clumping agent
  * [X ]  DMEM/F12 + 20% FBS + 1X P/S + 1:100 RevitaCell




Process:

1\. Place the pre-aliquotted  10 mL  mL of each respective type of Growth
Media into the water bath   08:30  am

2\. Placed shake tubes in centrifuge and centrifuge at 650 x g for 5 min at
RT.    09:37  am

Aspirated supernatant from each pellet.

Note* Ensure not to dislodge pellet of cells (it may be slightly loose) by
leaving a ~0.5mL buffer of supernatant and minimise bumps to the tubes.

Note* Condition of media is noted on culture shake tubes

Added 1mL of respective growth media to each tube and used a P1000 pipette to
break up cell clumps.

Remaining 9mL of each respective media was added afterwards and triturated
with 10mL serological pipette to break up cell clumps for each culture further
and resuspend cells evenly.

4\. Returned 4 x vessel to incubate at:    10:00 am Shaking at 206 RPM

  1. [X ]  37ÂºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  2. Incubator (#67 ), Lab [Library]
