performing these counts. Culture ID 7045. See lab book here: https://au-

1\. Pre-set oven to 55 degrees Celsius.  
3\. Shaker tube was taken from the incubator and centrifuged for 5min at 650g
14:40-14:45  
4\. Spent media discarded and cells re-suspended in 1mL PBS. NOTE: Used 200 uL
pipette to resuspend cells evenly in solution, however there were many clumps
of cells which were difficult to break up and so required a lot of pipette
mixing.  
5\. 3x 20ul samples taken for counting (unwashed samples).  
6\. Cells centrifuged again for 5 minutes at 650g  14:53-15:02 (had to be re-
centrifuged as cells did not pellet properly)  
7\. PBS aspirated and cells re-suspended in 1mL PBS.  
8\. 3x 20ul samples taken for counting (washed samples).  
9\. 1x washed and 1x washed sample placed in the oven at 55 degrees for 25min
(positive dead cell samples). unwashed: 14:55 washed: 15:12  
10\. 20ul Hoechst diluted in 1mL in DMEM.  
11\. 80ul of diluted Hoechst added to each sample, then samples place in the
incubator for 10 minutes .  
  
Washed Samples: 15:15  
Unwashed Samples: 14:55  
Washed dead Cell Samples: 15:40  
Unwashed dead cell samples: 15:27  

  
12\. After 5 minutes of incubation with Hoechst, propidium Iodide (PI) was
added to each sample as follows.

Washed 1: 5ul PI (Washed/High PI) 15:28  
Washed 1: 1ul PI (Washed/standard PI) 15:28  
Unwashed 1: 5ul PI (Washed/High PI) 15:05  
Unwashed 1: 1ul PI (Washed/standard PI) 15:07  
Dead cell control washed: 1ul PI 15:54  
Dead cell control unwashed: 1ul PI 15:42

13\. Cultures incubated for a further 5 minutes  
14\. 10ul of each sample take for imaging on a haemocytometer using the Axio
fluorescence imaging.  
15\. 10ul, 20ul, and 40ul of each sample transferred to well of a 96 well
plate for imaging by the Zaber. NOTE: Initially difficult to get focus right -
could not see enough signal on AF555 to focus on "live preview" so images are
focused on DAPI channel but out of focus on AF555 channel. Found plane of
focus for AF555 and set to that and re-imaged entire plate.

Observations/ summary - Axio  
Axio images: All axio images were taken under culture ID 7045 :https://mia-
capture.vow.tools/#/session/recA4AMHiZjdMsdPe/images.

Under phase microscopy, it was very difficult to differentiate debris from
cells (See Image 1).

We did not observe PI staining in any of the samples using the Axio
fluorescence microscope. We did see Hoechst staining however debris was also
less brightly stained (See image 2).

5x magnification on DAPI channel.  




Zaber results summary

Initially imaged by focusing on DAPI channel. DAPI images (Hoechst stain)
showed either minimal or no cells and AF555 (PI stain) images showed potential
positively stained cells that were just very out of focus (Figures 1 & 2)

Figure 1: Hoechst stain, DAPI, 5X, Well D3

Figure 2: PI stain, AF555, 5X, Well D3

Changed focus to focus on AF555 channel instead of DAPI channel. PI-positive
cells showed up clearly in AF555 images (Figure 3), however no Hoechst-
positive cells were visible on DAPI channel (Figure 4).

Finally adjusted focus again to attempt to find a middle ground that would
capture stained cells in both channels. On live preview on the Zaber it looked
like it would work, however the images still showed no Hoechst-positive cells
(Figure 5). AF555 images showed great PI-staining (Figure 6).

The dead control cells suggested that washing is perhaps not critical to
achieve accurate PI-staining results. Unwashed samples had a far higher amount
of positive PI-staining than washed samples (Figures 7 & 8).

It was also determined that 40 uL was a better volume of sample for zaber
imaging, as it fully covered the base of the well. 10 and 20 uL samples stayed
in a droplet form due to surface tension and made focusing difficult due to
differences in depth across the droplet.
