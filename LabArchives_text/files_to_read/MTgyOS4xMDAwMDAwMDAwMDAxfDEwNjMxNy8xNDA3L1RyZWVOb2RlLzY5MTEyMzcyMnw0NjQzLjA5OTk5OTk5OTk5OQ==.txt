Process:

1\. Aliquotted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then
placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath for a minimum of 20 minutes
prior to use:

  1. TrypLE:    20 mL   mL in   1x 50 mL    tube
  2. dPBS (for washing)   20 mL   mL in   1x 50 mL   tube
  3. Times that all aliquots were placed in the water bath to warm before use   13:55

Note: if aliquots were placed in water bath at different times, record the
time stamp for each individual solution.




2\. Weight empty tubes

  1. Tube 1 (6836 Vit C + TGF) = 12.487 g
  2. Tube 2 (6837 Vit C only) = 12.460 g

3\. Washed the flask(s) with dPBS.

4\. Added    10   mL tryple to each vessel/well and incubated at 37ËšC for    8
min.

Note: Fibroblasts typically require 15-18 minutes of incubation with tryple,
slightly longer than MuSCs.

  1. Start/Finish time for tryple was  14:19  \-  14:27   




5\. Aspirate cell suspension from both T-175 flasks and transfer into sterile
pre-weighed 50 mL tubes

6\. Wash flask with 10 mL room temperature dPBS

7\. Centrifuge tubes at 650 x g for 5 minutes

  1. Start/Finish centrifuge time was 14:37 - 14:42

8\. Aspirate supernatant

9\. Weight tubes containing cell pellet

  1. Tube 1 (6836 Vit C + TGF) =  12.702 g
  2. Tube 2 (6837 Vit C only) =  12.686 g

Weight of pellet:

  1. Tube 1 (6836 Vit C + TGF) =   0.215 g
  2. Tube 2 (6837 Vit C only) =   0.226 g
