5mg of p53i in stock

https://www.scbt.com/p/pifithrin-alpha-p-nitro-cyclic-60477-38-5

MW = 299.35

We need 100uM  

Soluble in DMSO (2.5 mg/ml)

  




  1. Sterile filter 5mL DMSO
  2. Resuspend 5mg of p53i in 3.34mL of sterile DMSO.
  3. Aliquot (10mM conc) 150uL into 23 x aliquots (sterile eppendorf tubes) and store at -20ºC




Aliquot 6mL of dPBS into 2 x tubes (6mL each).

Add 120uL of 5mM p53i to 1 of the tubes.

Add 120uL of DMSO to the other tube.

Remove growth media from wells, add 500uL/well of 100mM p53i/dPBS solution to
3 wells on each plate.

Add 500uL/well of DMSO/dPBS solution to 3 wells on each plate.

  

  

  




  1. Remove the growth media and wash all plates with 5mL dPBS. Split the plates into 4 groups (G1-G4)

  2. Add 10mL of fresh dPBS with/without 100uM of p53 inhibitor (Pifithrin-α, p-nitro, cyclic) to each plate (see table below for which plates require p53 inhibitor) PLEASE SEE THIS DOCUMENT PRIOR TO HANDLING P53 INHIBITOR

  3. GroupUV irradiation p53 inhibitor.   
G1NoNo  
G2NoYes  
G3YesNo  
G4YesYes  
  4. Inside the BSC, Wrap plates from G1 and G2 in foil and leave in the BSC. 

  5. Set up the reptile solar lamp inside the BSC at a distance that is 30cm from the plate surface, using the UV meter, detect the UV intensity emitted by the lamp and record it (mW/cm^2). Perform a calculation to determine the length of time required to generate a 600,000 J/m^2 UV energy dose using the following formulas.  
  
mW/cm2 x seconds = mj/cm2

0.1 mJ/ cm2 = 1 J/m2

  6.  ~1 mW/cm2 x 3600 (1h) = 3600 mj/cm2 = 36,000J/m2

  

Note* the light is simply too dim. Holding 1 x 24-well plate (empty) without a
lid directly up to the light (touching), still only yields a UV intensity of
0.7mW. This would take far too long to expose. The cells are also under-
confluent and need time.

  

  

Plan:

RS to source a much stronger UV lamp over the weekend.

100% Feed all cells today to allow them to grow over the weekend.

Re-attempt on Monday (3 days from now)
