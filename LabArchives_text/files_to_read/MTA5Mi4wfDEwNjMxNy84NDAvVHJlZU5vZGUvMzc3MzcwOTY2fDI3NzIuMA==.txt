Preparation of zein

Volumes of zein needed for different plate formats:

6-well plate - 1 scaffold = 1ml

24-well plate - 1 scaffold = 300 ul (pipetted onto 2 ml of water)

96-well plate - 1 scaffold = 50ul

  

  1. Determine the following key volumes and weights to make the desired number of scaffold pieces:
    1. Number of scaffold pieces desired: 24 wells x 1 plate = 24 scaffolds 
    2. Volume of zein solution used per scaffold piece: 500 uL per piece, ~ 12 mL sol'n per 24WP 
    3. Total volume of zein solution (number of scaffold pieces x volume/piece) + loss/error: 5*3 + error = 18 mL total sol'n
    4. Total grams of zein required (total volume of zein solution / 5): 18/5 = 3.6 g zein powder
    5. Total volume of 80% ethanol to make (total volume of zein solution + loss/error to the filter): 18 + 2 = 20 mL 80% ethanol
  2. Acquire aliquot volumes of the Ultrapure water (sterile filter milliQ water using a 0.2 um filter into a sterile tube in the BSC) and of 100% ethanol.
  3. Weigh out 3.6 g of zein powder into a sterile sample pot and record the actual weight below:
    1. Actual zein weight:  3.612 g
  4. Transfer the zein powder, 100% ethanol and Ultrapure water into the BSC
  5. Make 20 mL of 80% ethanol in the BSC and filter it using a 0.2 um filter
    1. Volume made: ~ 18 mL
  6. Add 18 mL of 80% ethanol into a sterile sample pot/container and add a sterile magnetic stirrer bar (previously spray with ethanol then autoclave in a autoclave bag) inside the BSC
  7. Commence mixing of the 80% ethanol on the stirrer (sprayed down and brought into the BSC) and slowly add the pre-weighed 3.6055 g zein powder until it is all added
  8. Mix at room temperature until the powder has completely solubilised (20-60 minutes):
    1. Start time: 15:45
    2. Finish time: 16:12
  9. Add 2 mL of 0.2 um filtered ultrapure water to each well of a 24-well plate.
    1. Number of 24-well plates required: 1 plates
    2. Total vol. filtered ultrapure water required = 48 mL + error = 50 mL 
  10. After solubilisation, carefully add 500 uL of the zein solution to the top surface of the ultrapure water in each well in the 96-well plate (drop by drop) so that a skin forms on the surface of the water.
  11. Allow the zein to form in each plate inside the BSC with the lids completely removed for 60-90 minutes
    1. Start time (last plate): 16:20
    2. Finish time (started removing first pieces): 17:40
  12. Using a sterile spatula and forceps, loosen the edges of each zein piece from the walls of the wells and transfer the zein pieces into a sterile sample pot/container/tissue culture dish with 20 mL of DMEM. Discard any damaged or cracked pieces
    1. Number of pieces discarded due to damage or dropping:  2
    2. Number of pieces available for use: 22
  13. Seal the container and store the scaffold pieces at 4C overnight or until needed, for a maximum of 7 days prior to use.

## Finish time: 16:40
