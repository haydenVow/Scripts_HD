RELATED TO MILESTONE:  

### KR2: Characterise 2 x QMS-compliant suspension-adapted fibroblast clones
from our chosen species

KR4: Establish and run a suspension pipeline at a rate of 10,000 clones per
month

AIM/PURPOSE: To generate 384-well plate phase contrast images of DOLLY12
fibroblast cells to assess if the in-house ML model or FIJI macros can
accurately count cells in suspension.

HYPOTHESIS: Phase contrast images of DOLLY12 fibroblast cells in suspension
will be able to be accurately counting using either a modified ML model or
newly developed FIJI macro.

RESULTS SUMMARY:

Training set of images (from 384 well plate) were successfully generated of
DOLLY12 fibroblasts approximating the morphology and size of suspension cells.
Whilst the ML could identify cells in both low and high density images, it
requires additional optimisation for images with a sufficiently high number of
cells (>1000). Finally the ML model overcounts images from Day 1 post FACS
sort, likely due to condensation and/or debris appearing similar to cells the
model was trained from.

CONCLUSIONS:

Despite promising indications that the ML model could identify suspension-like
cells, further optimisation is required. Namely the model overcounts images
from early stages of the cloning process, given that only a few cells are
expected to be present. Moreover, dense cell populations are undercounted due
to the close proximity of cells to one another. Further work should involve
utilising CHO-S cells to train the model further.  

NEXT STEPS:

  * Generate training images using suspension adapted cell lines, namely CHO-S cells. An MCB of these cells has been established and therefore can be utilised for the continuation of this experiment
  * Continue refining the model using a training set of images of CHO-S cells in static suspension imaged on the Zaber
