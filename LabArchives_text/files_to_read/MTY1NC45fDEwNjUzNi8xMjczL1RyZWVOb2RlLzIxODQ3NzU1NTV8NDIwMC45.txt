Experiment Overview:

### ID: 705 - CHOMP Passage Limit

### Aim: To determine the passage limit of CHOMP fibroblasts

### Method:

  1. Revive CHOMP fibroblast aliquot from cryostorage 
  2. Seed 2 wells of a 6 well plate (6WP) at a cell density of 7500 cells/cm2 into DMEM/F12+20%FBS. 6WP seeding area is 9.6cm2 = 72,000 cells / well.
  3.  Cells fed every 3-4 days (i.e Once per passage)
  4. Day 7: Perform cell count on 2 well and passage into 2 wells of 6 well plate.
