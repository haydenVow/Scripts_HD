Procedure


PASSAGING OF NUCLEOFECTED CELLS

1\. Took 1 x images of three wells from one plate of the Control, ZIC1 +
CDKN1B and CDKN1B groups.

2\. Aliquoted the required volume of each reagent below, placed all aliquots
to warm in the bead bath for a minimum of 20 minutes prior to use:

  1. TrypLE (2mL per well): 144 ml in total
  2. dPBS (2mL for neutralising): 144 ml in total for neutralising
  3. dPBS (1mL for washing): 72 ml in total for washing
  4. dPBS for resuspension/DNA extraction (10 ml/condition): 30 ml in total
  5. Hycell cho basal media + GFs: 200 ml in total
  6. DMEM/F12 + 20% FBS + 1x P/S: 180 ml
  7. FACS Buffer (DMEM/F12 + 2% FBS): ?

3\. dPBS and tryple added to water bath at: 9:49 - 11:23  

Suspension cultures and adherent cultures were set up starting from 11:25 am
am/pm by EC. Cultures harvested for FACS sorting were passaged after lunch.  

The following passaging protocol was followed for each knockout/control group,
The supernatant from every well was also collected at all steps prior to
centrifugation following neutralization of tryple. All conditions were kept in
separate tubes.

4\.  Collected culture supernatant and washed each well GENTLY with 1mL of
dPBS (warmed).  

5\. Collected dPBS wash with previous supernatant and added   2  mL tryple to
each well, cells were then incubated at 37˚C for 8 minutes.  

6\. Collected supernatants into 50mL tubes alongside previous supernatants and
empty wells were washed with  2 ml  of dPBS. dPBS washes were then also
collected.  

7\. Centrifuged collections at 400 x g for 5 min.  

8\. Aspirated and discarded the supernatant(s) from cell pellets.

9\. Using dPBS, resuspended and combined pellets into one tube, taking care to
rinse out tubes with a small aliquot of dPBS. Total volumes of cell suspension
at this step for each cell pellet was:  

10\. Aliquoted 10uL of cell suspension for counting using a hemocytometer,
mixing 1:5 with Trypan blue. *This step was not followed during FACS prep of
cultures CDKN1B and ZIC1 + CDKN1B. In this case, cells were moved straight to
FACS prep protocol after dPBS resuspension.

11\. Cell suspensions were counted and total cell number was determined for
each group in the document below.

ZIC1 + CDKN1B cell count -  884,000 cells/ml

CDKN1B cell count - 664,000 cells/ml  

Control cell count - 780,000 cells/ml

12\. Estimated volume of cell suspension needed to seed 1xT175 flask seeded at
7000 cells/cm^2 for each condition (1.25x10^6 cells). *CDKN1B was seeded at
6400 cells/cm^2 due to lower harvests numbers.  
13\. Estimated volume of cell suspension needed to take for DNA extraction and
subsequent PCR (3x10^4 cells).

14\. Estimated volume of cell suspension needed to take for suspension
cultures (4.5x10^6 cells)

14\. Aliquoted the volumes of cell suspension listed for DNA extraction above
into individual 1.5mL tubes. Aliquoted the volumes above for suspension
cultures into 15mL tubes. Introduced the volume of cell suspension for
adherent culture directly into the flask already containing pre-warmed media
in it.




SETTING UP ADHERENT POOLED CULTURES

  1. Volumes of cell suspensions in dPBS listed above for adherent cultures were aliquoted directly into T175 flasks containing 30 mL of growth media. 
  2. Flasks were left to incubate at 30 degrees, 5% CO2 (incubator #140 ) static. 

  




SETTING UP SUSPENSION POOLED CULTURES

  1. 15mL tubes containing cell suspensions were centrifuged at 500g for 5 minutes.
  2. Supernatant was removed from each tube and replaced with Hycell Cho basal media + KSR + FGF-b + IGF1-LR3 to a maximum final concentration listed in the table above (Minimum volume in each tube was 5mL). 
  3. Cells from each condition were then resuspended and transferred to separate 50mL bioreactor tubes. 
  4. Tubes were placed in incubator (main lab), at 30 degrees C, 5% CO2, 1 x 50ml tube per condition shaking at 120 rpm. 

  




FACS SORTING SUSPENSION CELLS

FACS sorting was performed on the in-house Melody during training on the
30-Mar-2022. Sarah performed this task 48h post-nucleofection instead of the
usual 72h post-nucleofection.

  1. The collected cell suspension for each condition was transferred to a 1.5mL tube and centrifuged at 300g for 5 minutes. 
  2. Supernatant was removed. 
  3. Cells were resuspended in 500uL of FACS buffer 
  4. An esky box was packed for transport to the FACS facility 
    1. Pre-filled (medium) multi-well plates (8x96wp), parafilmed around the edges
    2. An ice pack
    3. Extra FACS Buffer prepared earlier. 
    4. 4x 0.22um filter capped tubes. 
  5. Once at the FACS facility: 
    1. Samples were passed though 0.22um filter lids into sample collection tubes
    2. A live dead stain was added to each of the sample tubes, 5uL of 7-AAD stain (invitrogen) 
    3. Cells from each condition were sorted into 2 x 96 well plates each containing adherent growth media, 1 cell per well (see FACS preparation for media compositions).
  6. Plates were transported back to Vow and moved directly to the incubator at 30 degrees, 5% CO2 (Incubator number #140, library lab ) (17:38)




FREEZING PELLETS FOR DNA EXTRACTION

  1. Added an additional 0.2mL of dPBS to each aliquot of cells taken for DNA extraction. 
  2. Centrifuged tubes at 500g for 5 minutes to pellet cells. 
  3. Removed supernatant from each tube then added all tubes to a yellow lid pot labelled with the epic number and date. 
  4. Stored cell pellets at −20°C in the bottom shelf of the freezer in library lab (63)

  

  




## Observations

  




## Reference Images.

the top 3 wells of all plates were inspected under the microscope and imaged,
1 image per well. No abnormal morphology was seen. All wells were 95-100%
confluent at the time of passage. There were no obvious differences in cell
morphology evident between groups during this inspection.
