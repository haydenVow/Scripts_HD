NOTE- 24WP WITH INSERTS DID NOT HAVE CULTURE IDS ON THEM! ONE OF THE PLATES
WAS LABELLED BLOCK 1 AND ANOTHER BLOCK 2, BY PROCESS OF ELIMINATION AND SAMPLE
NUMBER IT WAS CLEAR WHICH PLATE WAS BLOCK 3 AND 4, SO THESE WERE LABELLED 3
AND 4.

Process

  1. Collected from "media & gelatin" fridge:
    1. 14 x 50 mL black centrifuge tubes (containing the 14 media conditions made in the previous lab book entry) 
    2. E6 (mix #4629)
  2. Added 2 mL of each media condition or E6 to wells of 4 x 24-well plates according to plate map below. Label these plates on the lid as BLOCK 1, BLOCK 2, BLOCK 3, and BLOCK 4 (again according to the plate map).  


  3. Aliquoted 4 mL of E6 into 15 mL tube (this is feed of cell-free samples in 96WP). Placed in water bath. Timestamp: 15:35
  4. Transferred 4 x 24-well plates to incubator for at least 20 minutes. Timestamps: 16:00  

  5. While waiting for media plates to warm, brought plate 6587-DOLLY12-Sheep P13-2of2 (from Thermo incubator) into BSC. Retrieved warmed aliquot of E6 from water bath. 
  6. Using a multichannel pipette, aspirate media from samples (the top four rows will have media but no zein scaffolds, as these were collected for D1 sampling).
  7. Poured 4 mL E6 aliquot into a sterile trough. Added 230 uL of E6 to each well containing a zein scaffold. Returned plate to Thermo incubator. 
  8. Transferred 4 x 24-well plates (with warmed media) and 5 x culture plates (4 x 24-well plates) from Thermo incubator to BSC.
  9. Using a well ethanol-sprayed hand, picked up HTS well insert tray of BLOCK 1 by the edge and transferred to the corresponding BLOCK 1 media plate. Use the lid from the culture plate for the new plate (to avoid having to re-print a culture label). 
  10. Repeated for BLOCKS 2-4. 
  11. Returned 4 x culture plates to the Thermo Incubator and discarded old plates with spent media.
