### Process:

1\. Inspected wells under the microscope, 5x objective to observe which clones
were 100% confluent. Wells 100% confluent were set up for passage below.

2\. Filled added 3mL of growth media to new wells on 6 well plates for each
clone that needed passaging (see list above).

\- 5 wells for CDKN1A+CDKN1B clones

\- 5 wells for ZIC1+DHSR3 clones

\- 3 wells for CDKN1A + ZIC1 clones

\- 1 well for ZIC1 clones  
  




PASSAGING

3\. Plates were removed from the incubator and all supernatant was aspirated
and discarded.

4\. Wells were washed with 1mL of dPBS, washes were then discarded and
replaced with 1mL of Tryple+EDTA before plates were returned to incubate at 30
degrees, 5% CO2 for 8-12 minutes (*The cells were not neutralised with dPBS
prior to placing in a new destination well!)

5\. 100uL of the trypalised cells were aspirated and placed in a new
destination well in pre warmed media prepared in step 2.  

6\. Destination plates were moved to incubator 82 to incubate at 30 degrees,
5% CO2. The remaining cells for CDKN1A+CDKN1B clones were collected into 1.5mL
tubes. All remaining excess clonal cells were discarded.

FEEDING:

1\. Clones that were not passaged received a 50% media feed (1.5mL of media),
Media was aspirated and discarded from each well and replaced with fresh
growth media. Plates were then returned back to the incubator at 30 degrees,
5% CO2.




Observations/Summary:

As clones were not counted prior to passage, seeding density will be different
between each culture (100 uL of a more confluent well will have more cells
than 100 uL of a less confluent well)
