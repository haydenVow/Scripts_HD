## Performed by: NH




Feed

Aliquoted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then
placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath > 20 minutes prior to use

  1. Growth media   20mL OptiPRO + 4mM Glutmax, 10mL Complete Nuvonis suspension media
  2. Centrifuged at 500 g for 5 minutes
  3. Removed 5 mL of spent media and discarded
  4. Resuspended in the remaining media, 20uL was taken for a 1:2 count with trypan blue
  5. Resuspended with   12 mL each of OptiPRO + 4 mM Glutamax with fresh media and transferred to new T75 flasks
  6. Returned to incubator 78 in library lab, 37C and 5% CO2




No tryple was used to passage these flasks as all cells appeared in suspension
and there were no signs of cell adherence.

There were live cells observed during the count

Total cell count in 12862 = 840K

Total cell count for 12859 = 800K
