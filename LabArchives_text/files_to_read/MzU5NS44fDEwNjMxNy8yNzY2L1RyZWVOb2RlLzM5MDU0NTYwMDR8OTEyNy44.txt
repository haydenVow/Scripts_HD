Summary of optimisations and learnings from first round of water run


The following observations and optimisations were made throughout the water
run:

Observation/Issue

Fix

Was the issue fixed?  
  
Volume was being aspirated from reagent reservoir incorrectly with multiple
air pockets.Adjust aspiration height from "default" height to 1.5mm from
bottomYes  
Dye wasnt washed out after 3 x PBS washes  
Implement 5 x PBS washes as a standard across all washing steps during ELISA
and Janus Green  
Yes  
Small amounts of volume in pipette tip remain after dispensingIntroduce
blowout as standard across all steps Mostly, a very small amount of volume
still remains after blowout  
Volume of dye ("antibody") in wells not being fully aspirated  
Increase amount of washing or lower aspiration height  
Lowering aspiration height from 1.5mm above wells is risky. By doing so, it
may result in uneven volume transfer. Hence, it was observed that after 5
washes, resulting liquid was clear and no trace of Allura Red could be visibly
seen. Thus, increasing PBS washes is the recommended fix.
