## Feed Preparation

1\. Aliquoted  1x 48 mL  mL of  E6 Dif Media into  1x 50mL  tube(s). Labelled
aliquots with the feed date and 'EPIC21489'.  
Placed aliquots in media fridge 74 in main lab 10:40 11/08  

2\. Aliquots placed in water bath   10:25  




## Waveform Check

1\. Pressed one of the three largest buttons on the oscilloscope inward to
wake up the device.  
  
2\. Record if the waveform is curved or rectangular. Select one:

#

[x] Both are curved.  
[  ] Both are rectangular.  
[  ] The purple waveform is curved but the yellow waveform is rectangular.  
[  ] The yellow waveform is curved but the purple waveform is rectangular.  
  
This check indicates if the cells were receiving the stimulation or not.




## Imaging

1\. Removed the hook test clips from the electrode connection pins on the
culture dish lid  
  
The test hook can be released from the pin by squeezing the spring loaded test
hook handle. It is best not to touch the metal electrode pins while doing
this. Hold the plastic culture dish lid for stability. If any wires become
dislodged and the operator is unsure about reattachment, contact experiment
owner for assistance   Jared - 0420881185

  
2\. Imaged both plates, taking whole well images of every well using the zaber
10:45 (Plate 1), 11:00 (Plate 2)  

For information on how to use the zaber, refer to:

Tips for imaging the 12WP are to use 8x8 imaging sites in the HSC site
generator, remembering to change the spacing rule to field of view with 60 um
spacing. Remember to build the MM List in the HSC site generator and confirm
the number of images expected (usually >700) in the Mult-D Acq.




Feed Process:

1\. Removed aliquots from the water bath   11:30  

2\. Moved culture dish from the incubator to the BSC.  11:30  
  
3\. Removed and placed the electrode culture lid on its back inside the
incubator to keep the electrodes sterile.

4\.  100% of supernatant from the vessel was removed.

5\. Replaced with  2mL (per well/per vessel) of  E6 Dif  media.

6\. Returned vessel to incubate and connected the test hooks back up to the
electrode pins on the culture dish lid so that each set of hooks connects to
the corresponding wire colour and so that the black hooks are aligned on the
left side of each well and the red hooks on the right (see wiring setup
reference image below)   12:00  

  * [x]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (aviary cells)

  

  * [ ]  Thermo Incubator (ID #13)
  * [ ]  Top Sanyo Incubator (ID #25)
  * [x]  Bottom Sanyo Incubator (ID #80)  

  * [ ]  Top Binder Incubator
  * [ ]  Bottom Binder Incubator
