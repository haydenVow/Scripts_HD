Guidance for Showcase slides:

each week:

  1. Title slide which includes the project name, participants, date and hustle number (this is important as we save these presentations in LabArchives and we want that info immediately available to someone going back six months to look at a presentation). This slide doesn't need to be described each week, but is a good historical record
  2. Goal statement slide with KR/milestone updates
  3. Simple quarterly roadmap highlighting important events that have been completed or are soon due
  4. Results slide/s (anything interesting/exciting from the week you want to share)
  5. Blockers/questions (what is slowing us down, and where do we need help?).
