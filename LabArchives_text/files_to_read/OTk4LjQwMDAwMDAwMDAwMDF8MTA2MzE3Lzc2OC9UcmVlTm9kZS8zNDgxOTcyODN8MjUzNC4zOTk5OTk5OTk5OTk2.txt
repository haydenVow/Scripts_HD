### Process:

1\. Took image of vessel with microscope on phase setting.

2\. Gelatin coated     1     x     T175     vessel with sterile filtered 0.1%
gelatin solution and then incubated all coated flasks at 37˚C.

  1. Time when all vessels(s) placed into the incubator       12:00pm 

3\. Aliquotted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then
placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath for a minimum of 20 minutes
prior to use:

  1. TrypLE:     8    mL in     1    tubes
  2.  dPBS (for washing and neutralising):     10    mL in    1    tubes
  3. Growth media (for seeding):     20    mL in     1    tubes

Time that all aliquots were placed in the water bath the warm before use
14:08pm

Note: if aliquots were placed in water bath at different time, record the time
stamp for each individual solution.




4\. Removed vessel(s) from the incubator     14:15pm

5\. Washed the vessel(s) with dPBS (warmed).

6\. Added     2    mL tryple to each vessel/well and incubated at 37˚C.

  1. Start/Finish for TrypLE was     14:20-14:35 pm 

7\. Neutralised with     2mL     dPBS and combined cell suspension into a
50mL    tube.

8\. Centrifuged at 650 x g for 5 min.

  1. Start/Finish time for centrifugation was     14:37-14:42 pm 




9\. Aspirated the supernatant(s).

10\. Resuspended pellet(s) in    30     mL     growth     media     14:45  pm




  

11\. Transferred entire cell suspension into the pre-gelatin coated      T175
vessel.

12\. Transferred vessel(s) to incubate at:

  * [ x ]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (avian cells)

Observations/Summary:

Cells are very confluent. Not taking on a HUVEC-like cobblestone morphology,
but I'm not sure what kind of endothelial cells we should expect to isolate
from muscle.




### Results:

  * Results were;
    * [ x ]  As Usual (this is a repetitive task)
    * [ ]  Unexpected because...
    * [ ]  Need to be further analysed
    * [ ]  Other (.......)
