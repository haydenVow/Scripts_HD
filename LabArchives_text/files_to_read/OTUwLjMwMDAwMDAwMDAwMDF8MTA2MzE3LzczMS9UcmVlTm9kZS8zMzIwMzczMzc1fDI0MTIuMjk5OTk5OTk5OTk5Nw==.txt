# Procedure

  1. Original Plate was removed from the incubator and transferred into the BSC 
  2. All wells on a 24-well plate was filled with 1.5 ml of PBS per well (1 well for each sample to be fixed and stained)
  3. Wash 1:  13:14
  4. Wash 2: 13:20
  5. Wash 3: 13:26
  6. Remove wash and add 1.5 mL of 4% PFA to each well
  7. PFA FIXING: fix for 15 minutes 13:45 - 14:00
  8. Wash with PBS
  9. Added 1.5 mL of DAPI mix to each well (final conc.1 ul / ml). 14:09 - 14:16
  10. Wash with PBS:
    1. Wash 1:  14:17 - 14:22 
    2. Wash 2: 14:22 - 14:27
  11. Parafilm and store plate away




Imaging

  1. After incubation, the plate was placed under the Axiovert microscope for imaging under the DAPI channel, 5x/10x objective
  2. 3x images were captured for each well and write notes on observations in the table below - copy and paste images and details below
  3. The plate was covered with foil and stored until images were deemed final

Imaged on May 6

# Observations

Despite samples being contaminated, we continued with the fix and stain. The
contamination was most prominent on the control samples which was binned the
previous day. Seed lab book for more details on contamination. For the plate
containing cells, the contamination was less obvious. Some of the wells had
media that was yellow in colour, indicating contamination had occurred
resulting in consumption of media components and excretion of metabolic waste,
resulting in a more acidic environment. Furthermore, the media in some of
these wells was slightly cloudy, which generally occurs when samples have been
contaminated. The likely cause of this may be a result of the samples not
having enough sterilisation time, whereby the samples are too thick and the
autoclave sterilisation was unable to penetrate throughout the scaffold.
Additionally, the flour obtained was from a non sterile source (supermarket)
and therefore has a higher risk of causing contamination.
