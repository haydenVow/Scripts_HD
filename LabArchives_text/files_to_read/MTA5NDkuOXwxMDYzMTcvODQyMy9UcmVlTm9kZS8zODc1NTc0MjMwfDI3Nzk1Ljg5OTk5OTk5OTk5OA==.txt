Aim/Purpose


To determine whether the maximum cell density achieved by Nuvonis suspension
differs when using in-house vs. bottled RPMI.


Hypothesis


That Nuvonis suspension cells grown in either in-house or bottled RPMI will
achieve a comparable maximum cell density.


Technical Gap


The bottled RPMI we use in the R&D lab is not exactly the same as the in-house
RPMI used by manufacturing (ie. the RPMI used by manufacturing does not
contain phenol red). In order to deliver transferable results to
manufacturing, we want to test whether using one medium or the other has any
impact on the maximum cell density achieved.


Method/Procedure


  * D0 (TUES): Seed 3 x E-125s in 75/25 RPMI/CHO-in-1 media made up using the in-house RPMI media formulation and 3 x E-125s in 75/25 RPMI/CHO-in-1 using the bottled RPMI.
  * D1 (WED): Perform cell counts on all flasks (do not perform feeds).
  * D2, D3 etc: Repeat D1 process until maximum density has been reached in all flasks (informed by plateauing and then declining cell counts) 
  * Plot growth rate vs. media type (line graph) and total cell count vs. media type (column graph)
