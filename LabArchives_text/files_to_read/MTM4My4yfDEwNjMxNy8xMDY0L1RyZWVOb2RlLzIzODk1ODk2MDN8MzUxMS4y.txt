  1. The Aim and Hypothesis should be recorded in the EPIC header, not in the experiment plan.
  2. Design your experiment with the next steps in mind. What are the next steps if the experiment succeeds? What are the next steps if the experiment fails? Design the experiment as best as possible so that there is compelling evidence for deciding on next steps.


Method/Procedure

  1. [Experiment Plan]
    * 20/05 - D1: Seed into a 24 well plate
    * 22/06 - D2: Feed cells with prolif media 
    * 21 - 24/05 - Make E6 and E6 + creatine media. 
    * 24/05 - D0: 100% feed with E6 and E6 + creatine media at varying concentration (Date will vary according to when cells are ready)
      *     * 25/05 - D1: 100% feed with E6 and E6 + creatine media at varying concentration
    * 26/05 - D2: 100% feed with E6 and E6 + creatine media at varying concentration 
    * 27/05 - D3: 100% feed with E6 and E6 + creatine media at varying concentration 
    * 28/05 - D4: 100% feed with E6 and E6 + creatine media at varying concentration 
    * 29/05 - D5: 100% feed with E6 and E6 + creatine media at varying concentration
    * 30/05 - D6: 100% feed with E6 and E6 + creatine media at varying concentration
    * 31/05 - D7: 100% feed with E6 and E6 + creatine media at varying concentration 
    * 01/06 - D8: 100% feed with E6 and E6 + creatine media at varying concentration 
    * 02/06 - D9: 100% feed with E6 and E6 + creatine media at varying concentration 
    * 03/06 - D10: Fix and Primary Stain (MF20)
    * 04/06 - D11: Fix and Secondary Stain + DAPI 
    * 05 - 07/06 - D9: Image plates 
    * 08/06 - D12: Analysis and Results
