## Start Electrical Stimulation

###  

### Gelatin = Blue and Orange plate (Laminin is Yellow and Green)

###  

### 1\. For instructions on how to use the StimJim for electrical stimulation
of cells, see the StimJim Notion Page.

###  

### 2\. Connecting the Wiring

The test hook can be opened by squeezing the spring loaded test hook handle.
Connect the correct test hook to its corresponding electrode pin.  
  
The channels are colour coded. Connect the two wires for each colour to its
corresponding column. By convention, we connect the black hook to the left pin
and the red hook to the right pin. This is to maintain experiment consistency.
It is best not to touch the metal electrode pins while doing this since they
are delicate. It is recommended to hold the plastic culture dish lid for
stability. The wiring should be connected as per the images below:

  



### 3\. Perform a Test Run

For detailed instructions on how to do this, refer to the StimJim Notion Page.  
  
This is to check and record the voltages the cells are actually seeing, using
feedback function within the StimJim.  
The test run is set for a finite amount of time. Anywhere between 10 and 100
seconds is recommended.

  1. Ran the stimulation pulse   13:15   
Stimulated with parameters:  
  
S0,0,0,500000,10000000; 4500,2000,6000; -4500,-2000,6000  
  
(29/11) Changed the frequency from 2 to 20 Hz  
S0,0,0,50000,10000000; 4500,2000,6000; -4500,-2000,6000  
  
(3/12) Changed the frequency from 20 to 50 Hz  
S0,0,0,20000,10000000; 4500,2000,6000; -4500,-2000,6000  
  
Paste the above sequence into the Serial Monitor.

  2. Paste the response from the StimJim in the Serial Monitor below. It should begin with 'Parameters for PulseTrain[0]'  
  
  
\----------------------------------  
Parameters for PulseTrain[0]  
  mode[ch0]: 0 (Voltage output)  
  mode[ch1]: 0 (Voltage output)  
period: 20000 usec (0.020 sec, 50.000 Hz)  
  duration:  10000000 usec (10.000 sec)  
  
  stage    duration     output0   output1  
    0     6000 usec     4500mV     2000mV  
    1     6000 usec    -4500mV    -2000mV  
\----------------------------------  
  
  
  
  
  

  3. Executed with command T0. Paste the response displayed on the Serial Monitor below. It should begin with 'Started T train with parameters of PulseTrain 0'.  
  
  
Started T train with parameters of PulseTrain 0  
Train complete. Delivered 500 pulses.  
Current/Voltage by stage:  
           Ch0                Ch1    
Stage 0  4559mV,            2057mV,  
Stage 1 -4549mV,           -2056mV,  
  
  
  
  
  

### 4\. Begin Continuous Stimulation

For detailed instructions on how to do this, refer to the StimJim Notion Page.

  1. Ran the stimulation continuously    13:20    
Altered the code to eliminate duration limit (so no feedback) and ran the
above stimulation parameters continuously. Executed with command T0.  
Once more, paste the complete response displayed on the Serial Monitor (as
recorded in the Test Run) below:  
\----------------------------------  
Parameters for PulseTrain[0]  
  mode[ch0]: 0 (Voltage output)  
  mode[ch1]: 0 (Voltage output)  
  period:    20000 usec (0.020 sec, 50.000 Hz)  
  duration:  10000000 usec (10.000 sec)  
  
  stage    duration     output0   output1  
    0     6000 usec     4500mV     2000mV  
    1     6000 usec    -4500mV    -2000mV  
\----------------------------------  
  
  
  
Started T train with parameters of PulseTrain 0  
  
  
  
  




### Observations/Summary:

 100 % media changed on vessel(s)

  1. All vessels.

Electrical stimulation restarted on both plates with a new frequency of 50 Hz
