Perform bank using below volumes

  




## Performed by: Bonnie Tangey




Observation of JUMBO cultures prior to bank.

All cultures were 90-100% confluent prior to bank.




Observations/Summary:  
I would expect a much higher cell yield with this confluence than we actually
got. Again I am unsure if this is due to the centrifuge (although supernatant
appears clear and did not result in a great increase in numbers once
centrifuged for a second time). I will re-seed some cells into T75 flasks with
vented caps to see if this improves yield at the next passage.
