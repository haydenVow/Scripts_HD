Stained and imaged cells adhered to microcarriers

  1. Removed culture(s) from the incubator (Top sanyo - 3xE125s) (bottom sanyo incubator two sets of 3x50mL spin tubes) and placed them in the BSC  `| 14:40 |`
  2. Swirled culture(s) by hand inside the BSC to suspend the microcarriers, the lid was quickly removed and 3x20uL samples of each culture were taken while the carriers were still suspended. This ensures the carriers were evenly mixed at time of sampling.
  3. Transferred the aliquot(s) to separate well on a 96 well plate and mixed 80uL of dPBS containing 20uL/mL of Hoechst 33342. 
    1. Make up the dPBS and Hoechst mix in a 15mL tube then aliquot 80uL of the mix into each well. 
    2. Use one row for each vessel group.  
Row A, E125 flasks,  
Row B, 50mL shake tubes 4-6  
Row C, 50mL shake tubes 7-9  
Create a new plate ID for this imaging plate so it can be scanned using the
zaber QR code scanner.

  4. Returned cultures to the incubator  `| 14:46  |`
  5. Left the 96 well plate to incubate at room temperature, in the dark (away from light), for 20 minutes.  `| 14:49 - 15:09 |`
  6. After incubation the wells were inspected under the Zaber microscope.
  7. Captured images under the 5x objective of the centre of each well using Phase and DAPI channels (1 image per well). 

  




### Observations/Summary:

### Had difficulties with Phase light levels - had to set saturation to 300 ms
- hopefully final images are okay!

### Images stored under: ID7200: https://mia-
capture.vow.tools/#/session/recgSTLcAxLezF202/images

Parafilmed plate and put in "fixed plates" fridge so can re-hoechst and re-
image if needed

### Results

  * Results were;
    * [ ]  As Usual (this is a repetitive task)
    * [ ]  Unexpected because...
    * [ ]  Need to be further analysed
    * [ ]  Other (.......)
