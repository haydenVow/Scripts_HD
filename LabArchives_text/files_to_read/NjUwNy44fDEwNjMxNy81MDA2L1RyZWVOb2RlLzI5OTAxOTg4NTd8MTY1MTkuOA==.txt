Aim/Purpose


To repeat the EPIC21489 Test 1 experiment setup and conditions, while
obtaining better MyoG and MF20 staining results.


Hypothesis


Repeating the stimulation parameters of 4 or 1.3 V/cm and using stainless
steel electrodes with the same seeding density as in Test 2, will produce
increased MuSC maturation with increased MyoG and MF20 staining results,
compared to unstimulated conditions.


Technical Gap


Previous results indicated increased MuSC differentiation and maturation under
phase images, however MyoG and MF20 staining were not successful. This was in
part due to the large muscle pieces lifting off the base of the wells and
limited MyoG or MF20 visible after staining. The staining protocol and
technique were suspected for both the cells lifting off the base of the wells
and the limited visible staining. By repeating Test 1 and attempting to re-
stain with an improved protocol, an increase in MyoG and MF20 may be seen.
This result would contribute to the team's Q3 milestone of enhancing
maturation based on 2x Myosin expression or 60% MyoG.

software with the following sequence:

## Cell and Media Requirements

### Seeding

### Each well in the 12WP is recommended to be seeded with 60k - 80k cells,
which equates to 720k - 960k cells per plate.  
  
1M cells divided up evenly per plate is the recommended method for seeding out
these plates.

  

Media

Generally 48 mL of media is required per day to feed 2 x 12WP with 2 mL per
well of media.

The first three days of culture is generally anticipated to be done using
growth media, however the cells may reach confluence earlier and will thus
require switching to differentiation media earlier.

Since E6 has an expiry of one week, it is recommended to make up 7x50 mL (350
mL) of E6 in 50 mL aliquots when starting the differentiation stage of the
experiment. Black plastic 50 mL falcon tubes are useful for this.

Note - Please double check you have enough of all reagents before commencing
the experiment.  
Note -  Serum media will be used in this experiment (D/F + 20% FBS +1X P/S)
for cell expansion and seeding, seeing as we are already using animal
components (gelatin) and our harvests of ACF cells are typically much lower
than for serum.
