Prepare materials for thaw and seed:

1\. Aliquoted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then
placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath for a minimum of 20 minutes
prior to use:

  * CHOMP growth medium (for cell count): 2 mL
  * CHOMP growth medium (for seeding 1 x T175s): 30 mL
  * CHO-S Growth medium (for seeding 1 x 96-WP for XTT assay): 15 mL
    * Time that aliquots were placed in the water bath to warm before use:   14:30    




## Thaw and seed vials:

2\. Collected the cryovial from Liquid Nitrogen storage & place in foam
floater in water bath for max 5 min

Location where cryovial was collected from:

Vial details:  1   x  CHOMP09  cryovials at  2M  cells each for a total of
2M  cells

Brew

Tower/Bucket #5

Box/Cane #5

Vial location: D3

Vial ID(s): see table above

``3\. Ethanol sprayed & transferred the vial(s) to the BSC.

4\. Added 1000 µL of Growth Media from 5 mL aliquot to the cryovial,
resuspended the cell suspension gently to reduce osmotic shock.

5\. Collected the entire 2 mL of cell suspension & transferred back into the
pre-warmed tube of Growth Medium.

6\. Using a 5 mL serelogical, gently resuspended and evenly distributed cells.
Checked exactly how much medium is in final cell suspension.

7\. Performed cell count: 1,487,200

8\. Added 1.08 M cells to 30 mL growth medium aliquot and seeded 1 x T175

9\. Used remaining cells to seed XTT assay (see here for XTT EPIC folder)

10\. Transfered flask/plate(s) to incubate at:

  * [ ]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * [x]  30ºC, 5% CO2 (reptilian cells)
