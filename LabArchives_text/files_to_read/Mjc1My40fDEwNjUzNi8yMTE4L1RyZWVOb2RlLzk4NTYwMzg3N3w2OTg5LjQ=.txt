Draw Note:

Needed to retrieve ~250 mL sample for regulatory testing. Connected the other
dip tube line onto a sterile 250 mL with cpc connectors and pumped ~250 mL
from the bioreactor into the bottle.




Fill Note:

There was only ~60L of media made up media in a palletank so this was added to
the STR200 to bring the volume back up to 110L. A fresh 200L batch was also
made up today and will be kept in a palletank bag overnight to be added to the
STR200 tomorrow if it passes QC.




Harvest Note:

Harvest Divided amongst Reg and Product:

To Reg:

  * 102g for Nutritional test
  * 84g for Bacteria/Fungus test
  * 91g for Antibiotic test
  * 52g for Allergenicity test

Sterile samples also taken (independant of harvest amount):

  * 35mL x2 for Growth Factor test (pellet)
  * 35mL x2 for Species ID (pellet)
  * 35mL x2 for Endotoxins (pellet)
  * 20mL x2 for Genetic Drift (pellet)
  * 10mL x2 for Mycoplasma (supernatant)

To Product:

  * ~395g

* Any 'missing' mass was likely left behind in the empty harvest jar as it was not possible to scrape every spec out.
