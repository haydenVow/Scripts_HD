Aim/Purpose


To assess two scaffold fabrication techniques for the creation of multi-
directional porous scaffolds.


Hypothesis


We will be able to use 3% agarose to cast scaffolds with multi-directional
pores.

  


Technical Gap

Method/Procedure


## 1) Heat Agarose 3% solution and place into syringe

## 2) Fill mould with 3% Agarose for casting

Mould 1: 3D printed PLA

Mould 2: Chromatic Alginate base, 3D printed PLA cylinder, 9 syringe tips
stuck into alginate base

Mould 3: Same as Mould 2 but with 3 syringe tips stuck into alginate base

## 2) Removal of cast and results

Mould 1:

The Agarose was easily removed from the mould and held its shape. However one
of the rods in the mould broke. 3D printed PLA at 2mm sizes is very fragile.
Alternate rod materials should be considered or possible supporting
mechanisms.

Mould 2:

Agarose removed from mould with difficulty and pores were not created. Part of
the cast remained wedged in the rods. Rods were places too close together.
Rods not being perfectly straight may also have caused issues with removal.
Another fabrication method may need to be considered so that rods are spaces
evenly and are straight.

Mould 3:

  

Agarose removed from mould easily and pores were created. More rods may be
added however spacing will need to be considered to ensure they do not
collapse or get caught during removal.
