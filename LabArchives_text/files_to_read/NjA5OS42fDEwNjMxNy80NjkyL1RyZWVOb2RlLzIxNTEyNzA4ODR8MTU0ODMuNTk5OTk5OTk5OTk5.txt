Reagent preparation:

Use the following spreadsheet to:

  * Determine the total amount of regent required for primary staining
  * Provide more information on antibody types

PBS:    160    (number of wells) x   200  uL  (volume per well) =   34 mL  (70
mL in total for Eva and I for all our plates - 8 plates in total)

PBST (0.2% Triton-X) :   160    (number of wells) x     100 uL  (volume per
well) =   18 mL (with excess)  

Blocking buffer:    160    (number of wells) x    100 uL  (volume per well) =
18 mL  

Note: blocking buffer is: PBST (0.1% Triton-X + PBS) + 3% bovine serum albumin
(BSA). Kept in the fridge until needed in blocking step

  

Prepared Primary Antibody Mix: :   50 µL   Primary #1 MyoG (Santa Cruz)
(1:200  ) +  200 µL   Primary #2 MF20 (DSHB)   (1:50  ) +   9.75  mL Blocking
Buffer

Pipette-mixed antibody mix and stored refrigerated away from light until
needed.

Process:

Permeabilise ( ~ 20 - 30 min)

1\. Removed PBS from each well.

2\. Added  100 µL PBST (0.2% Triton-X) to each well for 15 min:  12:05 - 12:30
pm

3\. Aspirated PBST for each well.




Blocking ( ~ 1 hr)

1\. Added  100  µL of blocking buffer (3% BSA in PBST [0.1% Triton-X]) and
incubate for 45 minutes - 1hr at RT. (no more than 1 hour):   : - : a/pm

8413   12:35 - 1:20 pm

8414   12:39 - 1:24 pm

8415   12:43 - 1:28 pm

8416   12:47 - 1:32 pm




Single/Simultaneous Primary Antibody staining ( ~ 10 minutes or 2hr)

1\. Removed blocking buffer from each well.

2\. Incubated cells with primary antibody for 90min - 2hrs at RT, or 4ºC
overnight:   : - : a/pm

3\. Parafilmed plates and stored at 4ºC in tissue culture lab Fridge.

After this step, all further task should be performed in a dark room. The
vessel should also be wrapped foil when not used.
