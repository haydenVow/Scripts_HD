Procedure


PREPARE DESTINATION VESSELS

  1. Filled all wells on 20x 96 well plates with 200uL of  DMEM/F12 (1:1) + 20% FBS +1xP/S
  2. Plates were placed in the incubator (140) at 30 degrees, 5% CO2 to warm. 

  







PASSAGING OF NUCLEOFECTED CELLS

  1.  Took 2 x images of each vessel with microscope on phase setting (4X to assess confluence) 
  2. removed the T75 cultures from the incubator then aspirated and discared the media from each. 
  3. Added 5mL of room temp dPBS to wash each flask. 
  4. Aspirated and discarded the washes, replacing with 5mL of 1xTryple-EDTA 
  5. Placed flasks to incubate at 30 degrees for 10 minutes, 5% CO2 (incubator 140). 
  6. Once cells were confirmed detached by inspection under the microscope (4x Objective), 5mL of dPBS was added to each flask to neutralise the Tryple-EDTA.
  7. The contents of each flask were collected into separate 15mL tubes.
  8. Tubes were spun at 500g for 5 minutes. During which time 20mL of FACS buffer was prepared and sterile filtered using a 0.22uM sterile filter (Phenol red free DMEM/F12 (1:1) + 2% FBS) 
  9. Supernatant from all tubes were discarded and the cell pellets were resupsended in 2mL of FACS buffer. 
  10. 500uL of each cell suspension transferred to separate filter cap tubes, 1 drop of 7-AAD was then added to each tube and tubes were left to incubate for 10 minutes at room temperature. 
    1. Single cells from sample PRKCD+CDKN2B were sorted into 2x96 well plates (The flow rate was set to high and all the sample was lost before 4 plates could be sorted) 
    2. Reduced the flow rate and added a further 500uL of FACS buffer to each remaining sample. 
    3. Sorted the remaining samples into 4x96 well plates, 1 single cell per well. 
    4. Plates were placed in the incubator 140, 30 degres, 5% CO2. Average plate sort time was 6 minutes. 
  11. 400uL of the remaining cell suspension was transferred to separate 1.5mL tubes and centrifuged for 5 minutes at 500g.
    1. Media was aspirated and discarded from each cell pellet
    2. Tubes containing cell pellets were placed in a yellow top 70mL container labelled with the date, EPIC ID and initials before being placed at -20 degrees in the library lab freezer (62) bottom shelf.  
  12. The 1.1mL of remaining cell suspension was centrifuged for a further 5 minutes at 500g. 
    1. Supernatant was aspirated and discarded 
    2. Cells were resuspended in 2mL of cold CryostorCS10 freezing solution. 
    3. Samples were then split across two cryovials each, 1mL of solution per vial. 
    4. Samples were placed in a Mr Frosty and placed in the -80 freezer in the main lab overnight.

## Observations

\- This process quickly became a two person job once the cells had been
passaged. Freezing cells may not be possible in the future with only one
person if done on the same day as the sort. It might be more efficient to keep
a sub population in culture for a further 4-7 days and then bank cells on the
next passage so as to avoid the manual load for the day. Freezing a cell
pellet for DNA work is suitable within the time to FACS sort however.

  




## Reference Images

Imaging station was acting up during the passage however all cells looked
healthy and there were no signs of contamination present in each of the flasks
passaged.
