Clones identified as ready for passage on the 21st (see lab book entry and
binary pick lists) were passaged by hand to new 96 well plate in the following
manner.

  1. Cells were removed from the incubuator (culture 12492 and culture 12389)
    1. Remaining clones on culture 12389 were inspected using the Primovert microscope under 4x objective to determine if any had reached conluences <90%. None had reached this level of confluence and so were discarded.
  2. Media was aspirated from the clones
  3. 200uL of dPBS was added to wash each clone
  4. dPBS was removed and replaced with 100uL of Tryple-EDTA.
  5. Clones were placed in the incubator at 30 degrees, 5% Co2 for 12 minutes.
  6. Clones were removed from the incubator, mixed by pipetting 5-10 times, then 20uL was transferred into a fresh well on a new 96 well plate containing 200uL of growth media (mix 12672)
  7. The new plate was then moved back to incubate (culture ID 12614)
  8. The old plate containing leftover clones was returned to the incubator to give the remaining clones a chance to reach 100% confluence before next passage.
