## Procedure




Tested for sterility

  1. Took a sample and transfer it to the well of a well plate.
  2. Observed the sample under the microscope.
    1. Signs of contamination include cloudy culture medium, motile particles visible under the 60x or 100x objective.  
  
Note to self- orient the bioreactor so that the sample value is at the front
and ensure the heating blanket does not cover this.

Calibrated dissolved oxygen probe

  1. Ran the calibration routine as per the operating manual using a single calibration point (would normally sparge with nitrogen gas to give a 0% reading but no nitrogen gas fitted to set up) 
    1. Sparged air at high flow rate and with high impeller speed until dissolved oxygen reading equilibrated at a high level.
    2. Set that level as 100%

Seeded the batch

  1. Thoroughly wiped down the seed bottle and corresponding line from the bioreactor with 70% ethanol.
  2. Placed the seed bottle and the end of the seed line in the BSC next to the bioreactor.
  3. Aseptically transferred the seed cells to the seed bottle.
  4. Make an aseptic connection between the bottle and the bioreactor seed line.
  5. Pumped the seed cells into the bioreactor.
