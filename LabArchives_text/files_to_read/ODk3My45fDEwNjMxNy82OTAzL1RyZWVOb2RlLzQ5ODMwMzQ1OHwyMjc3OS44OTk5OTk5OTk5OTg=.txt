Performed by: LL
Process
  
  
  1. Took 1 x 10 uL sample from each of the 6 wells seeded and performed manual cell counts with trypan blue and haemocytometer
  2. Added 20 uL per well of dPBS to bring volume up to 200 uL (have performed 2 x manual counts on each well in total) 
  3. Added hoechst and sytox green stain to wells and incubated at RT in the dark for 30 minutes 
  4. Performed dilutions in 100 uL of dPBS 
  5. Imaged on Zaber microscope (5X) on DAPI and AF488 channels and ran through macro 
  6. Imaged on Zaber microscope (5X) on phase and ran through ML model

>95% alive, look normal and happy, but a bit more clumped than D1.  
  
Went from 13K to 72K in 3 days which is 2.3 doublings which is roughly in line
with expectations

Bead test results (tested OT2 seeding protocol with cell beads)

Takeaway: ML model seems to not recognise beads as well as cells, I think they
are a bit smaller than our suspension cells. However, I think this data shows
that the ot2 protocol does a decent job at evenly distributing cells.
