### Process:

1\. Took image of vessel with microscope on phase setting.

2\. Gelatin coated     1     x    2CF      vessel and spare  with sterile
filtered 0.1% gelatin solution and then incubated all coated flasks at 37˚C.

  1. Time when all vessels(s) placed into the incubator     12:00 

3\. Aliquotted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then
placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath for a minimum of 20 minutes
prior to use:

  1. TrypLE:    45     mL
  2.  dPBS (At 37 degrees for washing):   45  mL  
  3.  dPBS (at RT neutralising):      45  mL 
  4. Growth media     5   mL  (for pellet resuspension) +     300  mL  (for seeding) = 305ml  

  5. Time that all aliquots were placed in the water bath the warm before use    15:50

Note: if aliquots were placed in water bath at different time, record the time
stamp for each individual solution.




4\. Removed vessel(s) from the incubator   16:25

5\. Washed the vessel(s) with dPBS (warmed).

6\. Added     15   mL tryple to each vessel/well and incubated at 37˚C.

  1. Start/Finish for TrypLE was     16:35-16:45   

7\. Tranferred tryple/cells to 1x 50ml falcon tube

8\. Wash each flask with 15ml tryple and transferred to another 50mL falcon
tube.  

8\. Centrifuged at 650 x g for 5 min.

  1. Start/Finish time for centrifugation was    17:05- 17:10   




9\. Aspirated the supernatant(s).

10\. Resuspended pellet(s) in    4     mL media    17:12  

11\. Aliquoted       4 x 80ul   of resuspended cells into seperate
microcentrifuge tubes for cell count.

12\. Performed a cell count using the haemocytometer and recorded the cell
count data in the Google Doc spreadsheet called 'Cell Count Spreadsheet' (see
link below):

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1DPzKubYxfHmWogVPihC-
SSIBtIylyrBQE5kRX5Z8NtI/edit#gid=0

  1.  Total cell number was:       5,192,000   (averaged from 4 counts)  

  2. Volume of cell suspension required for subculture was:   1.8ml
  3. Cell density per vessel:    2.4M per 2CF      




13\. Transferred       1800  µl of cell suspension to the pre-warmed
300  mL Growth media:      17:40  

14\. Transferred cell suspension into the pre-gelatin coated      2CF
vessel.

15\. Left at RT in the BSC for 30 min to allow cells to settle      17:45-
18:15  

16\. Transferred vessel(s) to incubate at: 18:15
