## We have experienced difficulty in the growth of CHOMP cultures over a long
period of time. Their rate of proliferation has also been shown to be slow,
relative to other species we have worked with. These findings of a slower
proliferation rate and culture lifespan of crocodile cells create difficultly
in our fibroblast research and production work. Thus, in this experiment we
are interested in determining the proliferative capacity of our CHOMP09 and
CHOMP07 fibroblast cell cultures over a long period of time, which will be
grown in DMEM/F12+20%Fetal Bovice Calf Serum+1x Penicillin/Streptomyocin.
