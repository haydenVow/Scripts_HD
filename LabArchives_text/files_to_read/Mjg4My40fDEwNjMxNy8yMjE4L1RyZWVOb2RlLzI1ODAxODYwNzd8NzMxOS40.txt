Growth Media:

  * [x ]  DMEM/F12 + 10% FBS + 1X P/S 




### Process:

1\. Took image of vessel with microscope on phase setting.  

3\. Aliquotted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then
placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath for a minimum of 20 minutes
prior to use:

  1. TrypLE:    10     mL in       1  tub
  2.  dPBS (for washing and neutralising):    10     mL in 1  tube
  3. dPBS (for neutralising):    10    mL in      1  tube
  4. Growth media (for pellet resuspension):   5  mL in    1  tube
  5. Growth media (for seeding):   250 mL  in   1 x 2CF   

  6. Flask with growth media were placed in the incubator to allow pH to equilibriate

Time that all aliquots were placed in the water bath the warm before use
15:34  

Note: if aliquots were placed in water bath at different time, record the time
stamp for each individual solution.




4\. Removed vessel(s) from the incubator   15:44

5\. Washed the vessel(s) with dPBS (warmed).

6\. Added     10    mL tryple to each vessel/well and incubated at 37˚C.
Checked tryple at 10 min, ~80% cells detached so replaced in incubator for 5
more min.  

  1. Start/Finish for TrypLE was   15:47 - 16:03     

7\. Neutralised with    10 mL   dPBS and combined cell suspension into   1 x
50 mL   tube.

8\. Centrifuged at 650 x g for 5 min.

  1. Start/Finish time for centrifugation was   16:06 - 16:11    




9\. Aspirated the supernatant(s).

10\. Resuspended pellet(s) in    5     mL       growth   media  

11\. Aliquoted     2 x 50ul     of resuspended cells into a microcentrifuge
tube for cell count.

12\. Performed a cell count using the haemocytometer and recorded the cell
count data in the Google Doc spreadsheet called 'Cell Count Spreadsheet' (see
link below):

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1DPzKubYxfHmWogVPihC-
SSIBtIylyrBQE5kRX5Z8NtI/edit#gid=0

  1.  Total cell number was:     1 550,000     

  2. Volume of cell suspension required for subculture was:    5 mL (total)    

  3. Cell density per vessel:   6,200 cm2 (seeding 1xT75 and 1xT175)    




14\. Transferred cell suspension into    warmed media from 2CF (collected
media from 2CF and put away the remaining in fridge)  

15\. Left at RT in the BSC for 30 min to allow cells to settle    16:34 -  

16\. Transferred vessel(s) to incubate at:

  * [ x]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (avian cells)
