RELATED TO MILESTONE:  2021 Q2 Cell Availability Milestone 1: Expand at least
one MuSC clone, which is capable of differentiation, to WCB2 using
microcarrier culture

AIM/PURPOSE: To demonstrate the serial passage and expansion of myogenic stem
cells in microcarrier culture.

HYPOTHESIS: That myogenic stem cells can be expanded using microcarrier
culture over at least 3 passages at least 70% as fast as in planar culture.

RESULTS SUMMARY: This should only be completed if the data can be visualised
with a single graph/image, otherwise simply state "See Report".

CONCLUSIONS: What were the overall findings? This should be a concise summary
and not duplicate the information in the results/report. For example "We found
that Bovine MuSCs could only achieve a cell density 50% of that observed with
planar culture without undergoing precocious differentiation. These results
mean that we are currently limited to X cells/ml in suspension culture until
we find a way to inhibit precocious differentiation"

NEXT STEPS: This should be a dot point list of any immediate outcomes, changes
to SOPs, as well as providing a direct link to any new experiments arising
from these findings. Importantly, this section should also include any
potential DEPLOYMENTS to the production team
