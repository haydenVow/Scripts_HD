Process Biopsy 1

  1. Aliquotted  80 mL  mL of each growth media for seeding 100 mm plates, and + 36 mL for 100% feed of 6 well-plates
  2. Coated 2x 100 mm plates with gelatin and 2x with ECM (1%) in L-15 media, and placed plates in 37C incubator for 1 hour 15:25
  3. Viewed 6 well plates under the microscope to confirm the presence of any adherent cells
  4. Removed  100  % of supernatant from and transferred to a 50 mL tube. Note: supernatant from each media/plate coating condition (3 wells) were pooled into a single 15 mL tube for seeding a new 100 mm plate. 
  5. Immediately replaced with  3 mL (per well/) of  urchin growth   media 1 or 2
  6. Centrifuged 50 mL tube at 300xg for 5 minutes to pellet potential suspended cells Biopsy 1 Spin: 18:11-18:15, Biopsy 2 spin 20:09
  7. Removed 100% of supernatant and resuspended in 10 mL of fresh media
  8. Transferred cell suspension to 100mm plates with their respective plate coating
  9. Returned vessel to incubate at: Original 6-well plates biopsy 1: 18:20, Supernatant plates biopsy 1: 18:54, Original biopsy 2 plates: 20:23, Supernatant plates: 20:58

  3. Viewed 6 well plates under the microscope to confirm the presence of any adherent cells
  4. Removed  100  % of supernatant from and transferred to a 15 mL tube
  5. Immediately replaced with  3 mL (per well/) of fresh   urchin growth   media 1 or 2 (Wells A1-A3 = Urchin Media 1, Wells B1-B3 = Urchin Media 2)
  6. Centrifuged 15 mL tube at 300xg for 5 minutes to pellet potential suspended cells 20:09-20:14
  7. Removed 100% of supernatant. 
  8. Resuspended and pooled pellets from uncoated, gelatin coated and ECM gel coated plates in 10mL of their respective growth media
  9. Transferred 5 mL of cell suspension to 1x uncoated 100mm plate and 1x gelatin coated 100 mm plate
  10. Added additional 5 mL of fresh growth media to plates, giving 10 mL total volume
  11. For ULA pellets, after removing 100% supernatant, resuspended in 9 mL of the respective growth media and transferred to a ULA 6-well plate, divided over 3 wells (Wells A1, A2, A3 = Urchin media 1, Wells B1, B2, B3 = Urchin media 2)
  12. Returned vessel to incubate at:  Original biopsy 2 plates: 20:23, Supernatant plates: 20:58

### Observations/Summary:

 100 % media changed on vessel(s)  
Plates in media 1 had a distinct cell coloured layer that was visible to the
eye, with a more prominent layer in growth media 1 on all plate coatings. This
layer was very sensitive to force, even slow pipetting led to disruption of
the layer.  
  
Microscopy:  
Greater cell density in media 1, with more cell aggregates. Cells appear round
in phenotype. No obvious signs of fungal or bacterial contamination.  
  
Ultra low attachment plates as expected produced the larger cell pellet
compared to other coating conditions

Due to insufficient media for biopsy 2, supernatant for growth media 2,
supernatants from all coatings will be pooled, spun and resuspended in 10 mL
of media and plated on only uncoated and gelatin coated plates.
