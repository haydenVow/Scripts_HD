Harvested the cells

  1. Cells detached according to protocol.
    1. Placed 500 mL bottle of FROZEN Trypsin in water bath 14:25
    2. Placed 800 mL of growth medium in the water bath 14:30
    3. Prepared 2 L of dPBS
    4. dPBS placed in water bath
    5. Turned off level control
    6. Turned off dissolved oxygen control
    7. Pumped remaining growth medium into bioreactor 15:30
    8. Pumped liquid out of bioreactor until level reached the bottom of the impeller 15:43 - 16:05
    9. Pumped in 1 L of dPBS 16:05 - 16:15 
    10. Pumped liquid out of bioreactor until level reached the bottom of the impeller 16:15 - 16:25
    11. Pumped in 1 L of dPBS
    12. Pumped liquid out of bioreactor until level reached the bottom of the impeller 16:45 - 16:55
    13. Pumped in 500 mL of Trypsin 17:00 - 17:07
    14. Increased stirring to 300 RPM 17:07
    15. After 7 minutes, pumped in 500 mL of growth medium 17:14 - 17:20
    16. Reduced stirring to 90 RPM 17:20
    17. Harvested cell suspension until level reached the bottom of the impeller 17:21 - 17:30
    18. Transferred cell suspension to 40 x 50 mL tubes
    19. Centrifuged the tubes at 650 RCF for 5 minutes
    20. Aspirated 49 mL from each tube
    21. Resuspended the cells and combined the remainder into 1 tube
    22. Took 3 x 1 mL samples of microcarriers for analysis for post harvest nuclear ejection analysis
    23. Performed manual cell count
  2. Logging stopped.
  3. Temperature control stopped. 17:31
  4. pH control stopped. 17:31
  5. Dissolved oxygen control stopped. 17:31
  6. Performed manual cell count 19:15

Decontaminated bioreactor

  1. Filled all connected bottles with 100 mL of 70% ethanol
  2. Pumped the 70% ethanol through the tubing and into the bioreactor
  3. Cut off the tip of the sampling tube and discarded.
  4. Pumped 50 mL of 70% ethanol back through the sample tube.
  5. Disconnected and removed the pH probe:
    1. Wiped with 70% ethanol
    2. Rinsed with water
    3. Wiped with a lint-free cloth
    4. Filled the storage cap with3.5 M KCl
    5. Replaced the storage cap and stored the probe upright
  6. Disconnected and removed the DO probe:
    1. Wiped with 70% ethanol
    2. Rinsed with water
    3. Wiped with a lint-free cloth
    4. Filled the storage cap with tap water
    5. Replaced the storage cap and stored the probe upright
  7. Disconnected and removed the level probe:
    1. Wiped with 70% ethanol
    2. Rinsed with water
    3. Wiped with a lint-free cloth
    4. Stored the probe in a thickly-padded foam box
  8. Pumped the 70% ethanol out of the bioreactor and into an empty waste bottle.

Cleaned the bioreactor vessel

  1. Added pH neutral, non-corrosive, bacteriostatic cleaning agent to the bioreactor, filling all the way to the headplate.
    1. Added ~3.5 L of 0.5% (v/v) Sonidet detergent solution
  2. Left the stirrer on at 300 RPM overnight.
