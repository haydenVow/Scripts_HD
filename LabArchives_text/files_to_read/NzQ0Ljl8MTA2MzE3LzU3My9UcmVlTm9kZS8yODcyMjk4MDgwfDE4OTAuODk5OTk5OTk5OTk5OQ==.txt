Reagent preparation:

1\. Aliquotted     mL  PBS for washing

2\. Centrifuged the secondary antibody stock using the benchtop
microcentrifuge for 10 seconds.

3\. Prepared Secondary Antibody mix:

  1 µL   AF488 Secondary #1   (1:1000  ) +  1 µL   AF555 Secondary #2
(1:1000  ) +  1  mL Blocking Buffer (PBST (0.1% Triton X + dPBS) + 3% BSA)  

If using AlexaFluor secondary antibodies then the max concentration should be
1:500 (typically used at 1:1000)

Vortexed antibody mix for 5 seconds and stored refrigerated away from light
until needed.

4\. Prepared DAPI mix:

   1mL  PBS +    1uL  of DAPI

Vortexed DAPI mix and stored refrigerated away from light until needed.

Process:

1\. Removed plate from fridge (incubated in primary antibodies overnight).

2\. Washed 3 times for 5 min with PBS at RT.

 14:50 - 15:43 a/pm

 15:49 - 15:55 a/pm

 15:58 - 16:04 a/pm

3\. Incubated the cells with secondary antibody mixture in the dark at RT for
1 hour.  16:10 - 17:17 a/pm

NOTE: from this step onwards protect from the light by wrapping plates in foil
and perform experiment in the dark.




Counter staining

1\.  Removed 2nd antibody solution.  17:18 a/pm

2\.  Washed with DAPI (1:1000) in PBS for 5 min at RT in the dark.

 17:21 - 17:30 a/pm

3\.  Washed in PBS 3 x 5 min at RT in the dark. (No Triton)

 17:30 - 17:35 a/pm

 17:36 - 17:41 a/pm

4\.  Replaced dPBS.

 17:42 a/pm

5\. Confirmed staining on microscope by imaging.
