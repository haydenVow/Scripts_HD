  16. 21-April-2021 (Day 2) Fix, DAPI stain and Image at least n=1 sample from each condition, if cells appear confluent and there is a good cell coverage across the material/scaffold surface then these cells are ready for transition to E6, see next step
  17. 22-April-2021 (Day 0 Diff) 100% feed of samples with E6 media (if above step applies, if not may leave the cells in growth media for a couple days longer and try again, if no proliferation observed the experiment would be ended early)

  22. SAT 17-April-2021 (Day 5 Diff) \- 100% E6 Feed
  23. SUN 28-April-2021 (Day 6 Diff) \- 100% E6 Feed
  24. 29-Arpil-2021 (Day 7 Diff) \- Fix, DAPI, MyoD stain, MyoG (?) stain
  25. Analyse and interpret based on images for each condition
  26. Report write up




12-April-2021 Preparation of zein (3SP)

  1. Dissolve zein powder in a 1:5 w/v conc. in 80% ethanol solution (using stir bar at room temp) (20-60 mins)
  2. Add 200 uL of sterile MilliQ water to each well of 3 x 96WPs 
  3. Add 50 uL of zein solution to the water in each well of 3 x 96WPs
  4. Leave zein to precipitate for ~1H (monitor throughout) 
  5. Once zein has formed a skin that can be manipulated with tweezers, separate from the edges of wells with sterile spatula and then use sterile tweezers to transport to a plate containing DMEM 
  6. Parafilm plate once you had ~50 scaffolds in 10 mL of DMEM and store (labelled) in fridge 




13-April-2021: monitor zein drying to determine optimal drying time before
seeding  

  1. Move 2 pieces of zein from DMEM to 2 wells of 96WP 
  2. Remove supernatant off of each piece
  3. Monitor throughout the day
  4. How dry do they get after 2hrs, 4hrs, 5hrs? Write observations and take image on phone/tablet.
  5. At end of day remove 2 more pieces of zein from media, remove supernatant and leave in a plate with the lid ajar to dry overnight
  6. Observe next morning. Write observations and take image on phone/tablet.




15-April-2021 Receive cells from cell expansion team

  1. Receiving cells passaged on Monday from cell expansion team 
  2. Need 25.6M in ACF for Monday (2 x 4CFs seeded low-ish?) 
  3. Need 6.4M in serum for Monday (5-6 x T175s?)




15-April-2021 Make up 2 L x E8 and then make into 9C (without lipids)

Quick calculations (how much ACF to make)

ACF (9C) If I do a 100% feed on Friday, I need (600x2) + (300x2) mL of 9C =
1.8 L

ACF needs for: equilibrating (200 uL per scaffold = 48 x 200 = 9.9 mL),
seeding (9.9 mL) and feeding (48 mL) = 67.8 mL + error = 75 mL  

Put aside 200 mL of 9C before adding lipids to make up other ACF iterations
for equilibrating, seeding and feeding.

E8 and 11E/ACF calculator:
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/124elwh67VrPyq7zPMqVI_g3-NUiVigjjaF64dVxeZa0/edit#gid=0

  1. Make 2 L of E8 according to calculator linked above (no need to filter - make in 2 L Schott bottle?) 
  2. Add ingredients to make into 9C (do not add lipids) 
  3. Pour into 2 x 1 L 0.2 um sterile filter units and filter 
  4. Pipette 200 mL of 9C medium into a sterile 250 mL pot (for making up ACF iterations for seeding scaffolds)
  5. Add lipids to 1.8 L x filtered 9C medium 




15-April-2021 Make up 50 mL of each 10C, 11B & 11E
