Aim/Purpose


Background

Using the foundations built up during the "Buffalo Wings" prototype work, we
will trial tissue engineering at larger scales and using suspension adapted
cells (Nuvonis fibroblasts predominantly). This work is part of the Mini-
Tissues workstream for the Second Product, more can be read about this here.
Initial Buffalo Wings experimental plans and lab books can be found here. From
experiment 1 we learnt that tissue formation does not occur at low cell
densities, with the best tissue forming at the highest cell density we had
trialed (15,000,000 cells/mL). We theorise the optimial cell density is much
higher than this value before tissue formation is inhibited. Further, in this
experiment no matrigel will be used in the moulds, this is based on the
findings of Experiment 3: Matrigel Reduction in which we saw tissue formation
in the absence of Matrigel (within 1 - 24 hours).

Aim

To understand the optimal cell density for tissue engineering in moulds using
suspension Nuvonis cells in a collagen-only matrix.

Hypothesis

Tissue-engineered tissues have a critical, optimum cell density (at the time
of seeding), above this critical cell density, tissue formation is inhibited.


Methods and Experiment Layout


Brief Method

The method followed here will be very similar to the one used for the Buffalo
Wings prototype large scale harvest. Briefly, this method will use Nuvonis
cells, embedded in a tissue gel matrix consisting of defined ratios of:
Collagen I, 10x DMEM/F12 and 0.1M Sodium Hydroxide. This allows the formation
of tissues via the process of tissue gelation, condensation and self-assembly
around 2 attachment points (Figure 1) - See Notion page for summary of
approach. In this experiment we will be excluding Matrigel given we observed
tissue formation in the absence of Matrigel (Experiment 3: Matrigel
Reduction).

Experiment Layout

We will seed 1 plates containing tissue engineering moulds with 12 tissues
each, at a number of different cell densities, ranging from 15 million to 60
million cells per mL (15M, 20M, 25M, 40M and 60M).
