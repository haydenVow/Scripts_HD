Deviations & notes

*Note: only BR 1 and 3 were unloaded as they were performing poorly. The counts had doubled for BR 2 and 4, so it might be interesting to leave them for the time being to see how they go. Enough feed media was available and the foam level looked fine to leave unattended for a few days.
