Process:

1\. Aliquotted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then
placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath for a minimum of 20 minutes
prior to use:

  1. TrypLE:    20   mL in     1X 50mL falcon  tubes
  2. dPBS (for neutralising)   20    mL in    1X 50mL falcon    tubes
  3. Growth media (for pellet resuspension):       mL in        tubes
  4. Growth media (for seeding):    300   mL in   500mL sterile container
  5. Times that all aliquots were placed in the water bath to warm before use    16:50

Note: if aliquots were placed in water bath at different times, record the
time stamp for each individual solution.




2\. Washed the flask(s) with dPBS.

3\. Added  5mL     mL tryple to each vessel/well and incubated at 37˚C for
13     min.

Note: Fibroblasts typically require 15-18 minutes of incubation with tryple,
slightly longer than MuSCs.

  1. Start/Finish time for centrifugation was    13:48    \-  14  : 01  a/pm

4\. Neutralised with  5mL per flask     dPBS (warmed) and combined cell
suspension into a   2x 50mL falcon (1x tube for explant culture) and 1x falcon
tube (for single cell cultures)   tube.

5\. Centrifuged at 650 x g for 5 min

  1. Start/Finish time for centrifugation was    14:11    \-    14:16    




6\. Aspirated the supernatant(s)

7\. Resuspended pellet(s) in    300    mL   growth    media.

8\. Performed a cell count using the haemocytometer and recorded the cell
count data in widget or the Google Doc spreadsheet called 'Cell Count
Spreadsheet' (see link below):

SSIBtIylyrBQE5kRX5Z8NtI/edit#gid=0

  




9\. Total cell number was:    31,520,000  

10\. ~~Seeded ~7k cells per cm2 of the flasks/plates. Note that fibroblasts
prefer to be subcultured closely together.~~

11\. Volume of cell suspension required for subculture was:    20mL  

12\. Transfer    all of cell suspension to the pre-warmed  300 mL Growth
Media.

13\. Transfer cell suspension into (non-gelatin coated)     2x T75, 6xT175
flasks/plates.

14\. Transfer flask/plate(s) to incubate at: 16:55

  * [X]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (aviary cells)
