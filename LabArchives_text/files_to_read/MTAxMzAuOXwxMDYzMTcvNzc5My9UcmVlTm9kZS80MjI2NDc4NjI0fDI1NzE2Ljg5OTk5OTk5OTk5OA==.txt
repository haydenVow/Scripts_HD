Process


1\. Imaged and counted cell suspension in haemocytometer (Imaged under ID:
11668; first five images show the appearance of the cell suspension prior to
the dead cell removal, the following show the appearance after the dead cell
removal)

2\. Centrifuged cell suspension at 500 x g for 5 minutes.

3\. Resuspended cell pellet in 1 ml of protocol recommended medium (0.1-2 ml
of recommended medium for > 1 x 10^7 cells).

4\. Transferred cell suspension to 5 ml cell sorting tube.

5\. Added 50 uL cocktail per ml sample.

6\. Added 50 uL biotin per ml sample.

7\. Mixed with the pipette and incubate for about 3 minutes.

8\. In the meantime, vortexed rapid spheres for 30 seconds.

9\. Added 100 uL of rapid spheres per ml of sample and mix with a pipette. Do
not incubate at this point.

10\. Topped up the sample with 1.5 ml of recommended medium and gently pipette
up and down.

11\. Placed the cell sorting tube in the magnet without a lid and incubate for
3 minutes.\

12\. Poured into a new tube and imaged it under the haemocytometer.
