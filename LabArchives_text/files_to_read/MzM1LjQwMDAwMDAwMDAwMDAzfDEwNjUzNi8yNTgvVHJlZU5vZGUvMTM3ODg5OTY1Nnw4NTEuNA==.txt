Experimental Observations:

Day of VitC Treatment (0hrs):

  * Very small aggregates have formed in 2 of the 10CF (Flask IDs: 7645 & 7647). This is before ANY treatment. Flasks have been in P4 proliferation phase for 6 Days (originally seeded at 16,460.20 cells/cm2)
  * None of the Corning (10CS) flasks have any aggregates. (not pictured)

24hrs after VitC (50ug/mL) Treatment:

  * Cell aggregation and sheet formation on 10CF flasks after only 24hrs of VitC treatment (pictured)
  * Still no cell aggregation in 10CS flasks (not pictured)

  

48hrs after VitC (50ug/mL) Treatment:

  * 3x10CF were all harvested (1x10CF - control, 2x10CF - VitC treated) (pictured)

                                                                                                                      Control Flask                                                                                               Control Flask

  

5 days after VitC (50ug/mL) Treatment:

  * 3x10CS were all harvested (1x10CF - control, 2x10CF - VitC treated) due to peeling/aggregate formation
  * Note: Air trapped in the cell sheets made them float to the top and did not pellet down even at 1000g
