RELATED TO OKR: Scale the Quail

AIM/PURPOSE: To find an alternative basal medium to Freestyle 293 that
supports proliferation of the Nuvonis quail cell line

HYPOTHESIS: That one of the tested media or media combinations will enable the
Nuvonis quail cell line to proliferate in suspension

RESULTS SUMMARY:

  1. RPMI+CDM4Avian, RPMI+HyCellCHO, CDM4Avian+HyCellCHO and F10+HyCellCHO had significantly higher mean cells/mL than all other media conditions (their means were not significantly different from each other)
  2. F10+HyCellCHO observationally appeared to cause more cell clumping than RPMI+HyCellCHO 
  3. RPMI+HyCellCHO is the best basal media candidate for further optimisation 

CONCLUSIONS: Our hypothesis was supported as a number of the tested media
enabled proliferation of the Nuconis quail cell line. RPMI+HyCellCHO was found
to be the most suitable media condition for further optimisation work.

NEXT STEPS:

Lily will run a 12-factor DSD using a 75:25 mix of RPMI and HyCellCHO as the
basal media. It will focus on each Nuvonis ingredient (yeast, ACA, IGF-1-LR3,
EGF, putrescine dihydrochloride and l-ornithine monohydrochloride) as well as
an additional 6 ingredients believed to improve cell viability and
proliferation in suspension.
