Tested CO2 flow

  1. CO2 regulator gauge still reading less than 1 bar and only slightly above 0 - therefore testing flow
  2. set pH set point to 7.0 from 7.5 which will require the bioreactor to sparge CO2
  3. observed trendline change in pH

Notes

  * when pH set point changed to 7.0, system turned on CO2 sparging
  * within 5 mins, pH reached 7.0
  * -> CO2 appears to be flowing adequately despite reading from regulator gauge
  * re-set pH to 7.5 set point, base-T pump turned on correspondingly as per cascade programmed

  
  
  
  




Tested for sterility

  1. Took a sample and transfer it to the well of a well plate.
  2. Observed the sample under the microscope.
    1. Signs of contamination include cloudy culture medium, motile particles visible under the 60x or 100x objective.

Calibrated dissolved oxygen probe

  1. Ran the calibration routine as per the operating manual
    1. Sparged nitrogen gas at high flow rate and with high impeller speed until dissolved oxygen reading equilibrated at a very low level.
    2. Set that level as 0%
    3. Sparged air at high flow rate and with high impeller speed until dissolved oxygen reading equilibrated at a high level.
    4. Set that level as 100%

Notes

  * performed single point calibration
  * set stirrer to 500 RPM
  * set sparging air to 200mL/min
  * waited 5 min
  * set dO as 100% using slope calibration
  * reset dO and STIRR cascades after calibration to previous settings

  
  
  
  




Set level probe

  1. Loosened the nut around the antifoam/level probe.
  2. Gently rotated and pulled the probe out until it reached the desired height.
  3. Tightened the nut until finger tight.

NotesNEVER push the probe back into the bioreactor after autoclaving as this
can introduce contamination.  
  
Not set - level probe not used  
  
  
  




Started data logging

  1. Navigated to Settings -> Data Logger
  2. Updated the name of the experiment
  3. Clicked Start New Experiment

Notes

  * named experiment EPIC31427-3-GEN-DRFT
  * didnt appear to start? "state = not running"
  * issues with connection. Keeps logging out, throws error 'system not available, server may be overloaded"
  *  hard restarted control tower and access returned
  * re-set all parameters
  * started experiment in data logger "GEN-DRFT-3"

  
  
  
  




Seeded the batch

  1. Thoroughly wiped down the seed bottle and corresponding line from the bioreactor with 70% ethanol.
  2. Placed the seed bottle and the end of the seed line in the BSC next to the bioreactor.
  3. Aseptically transferred the seed cells to the seed bottle.
  4. Make an aseptic connection between the bottle and the bioreactor seed line.
  5. Pumped the seed cells into the bioreactor.

Notes

  * cell count 536 000/mL live cells
  * require 200 000/mL density in 2000mL total
  * total number of cells required = 400M cells
  * ~750mL required
  * centrifuge cells and reserved supernatant. Resuspend in 250mL reserved media and added to seed bottle
  * added additional 150mL to seed bottle and added to bring total volume to 2000mL

 ~~Programmed the feed schedule:~~

  1.  ~~To create a schedule to to turn on the pump after 2 days (48 hours) for 22.5 minutes (~450 mL at ~20 mL/minute), followed the instructions below:  
~~

    1.  ~~Opened the SUBS-B pump menu~~
    2.  ~~Changed the SUBS-B MODE to MANUAL:OFF  
~~

    3.  ~~Opened the PROFILE sub-menu~~
    4.  ~~Set a timepoint for 000:00:00 with 0% pump output.~~
    5.  ~~Set a timepoint for 048:00:00 with 0% pump output.  
~~

    6.  ~~Set a timepoint for 048:00:01 with 100% pump output.~~

    8.  ~~Set a timepoint for 048:22:31 with 0% pump output.~~
 ~~~~

  2.  ~~To create a schedule to to turn on the pump again after 4 days (96 hours) for 45 minutes (~900 mL at ~20 mL/minute), followed the instructions below:  
~~

    1.  ~~Set a timepoint for 000:00:00 with 0% pump output.~~
    2.  ~~Set a timepoint for 096:00:00 with 0% pump output.
