Growth Media (for resuspension):

  * [ ]  DMEM + 10% HS + 1X P/S
  * [ ]  DMEM + 10% FBS + 1X P/S
  * [ x]  DMEM + 20% FBS + 1x P/S + P38i
  * [ ]  DMEM/F12 + 10% FBS + 1X P/S
  * [ ]  DMEM/F12 + 20% FBS + 1X P/S




Process:

 1\. Aliquotted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and
then placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath for a minimum of 20 minutes
prior to use:

  1.  TrypLE:  130mL in 2x urine jars. 
  2.  dPBS (for neutralising)   130mL +13mML for washing in 2x urine jars.
  3.  Growth media (for pellet resuspension):    20mL in 1 urine jar 
  4.  Time that all aliquots were placed in the water bath to warm before use:    13:35 

Note: if aliquots were placed in water bath at different times, record the
time stamp for each individual solution.




2\. Washed the flask(s) with dPBS.

3\. Added 100mL PBS to the 2CF and  15mL to each T75 to wash.

4\. Removed PBS and added 100mL tryple to the 2CF and  15mL to each T75
incubated at 37ºC for 10 min

5\. Neutralised with 100mL dPBS (warmed) and combined cell suspension into a
50ml tube.

6\. Centrifuged at 650 x g for 5 min. Start/Finish time for centrifugation
was:   14:26 - 14:31  




6\. Aspirated the supernatant(s).

7\. Resuspend pellet(s) in 20mL media.

8\. Performed a cell count using the haemocytometer and recorded the cell
count data in the Google Doc spreadsheet called 'Cell Count Spreadsheet' (see
link below):

SSIBtIylyrBQE5kRX5Z8NtI/edit#gid=0

9\. Total cell number was: 14 million

10\. Calculate the required volume cell suspension & freeze medium to generate
a concentration of ~1M cells/mL.




11\. Prepared   14mL Freeze Medium: (Cryostor).

Stored at 4ºC until use to keep chilled.

12\. Centrifuged cells at 650 x g for 5 min.  15:20  \-  15:25

Whilst centrifuge is spinning, prepared & printed vial labels, labelled
cryovials. (Note that passage number will be the same as the culture you
harvest from. The passage number will increase by 1 during the revive of a
vial.)




13\. Aspirated supernatant carefully, taking care not to disturb the pellet.

14\. Resuspended the pellet in 14mL freeze media Cryostor

15\. Aliquotted 500µL into 28 x cryovials (already labelled)- however 2 needed
to be discarded due to sterility breach.

16\. Tightened the lids & transfer the cryovials to 2x Mr. Frosty immediately
into the -80ºC freezer.  15:35

  * [ x]  With foam
  * [ ]  Without foam
  * [ ]  1st Freeze
  * [ ]  2nd Freeze
  * [ x]  3rd Freeze
  * [ ]  4th Freeze
  * [ ]  5th Freeze

17\. Allow the cells to freeze for at least 18-24 hours before transferring to
Liquid Nitrogen storage.
