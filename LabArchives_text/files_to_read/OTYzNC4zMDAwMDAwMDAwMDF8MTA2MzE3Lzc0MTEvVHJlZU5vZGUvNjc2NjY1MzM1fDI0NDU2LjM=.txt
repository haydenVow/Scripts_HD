Cell Count (2 x E250):

  

1\. Harvested 100ul per flask for cell count

2\. Diluted 1:2 with trypan blue ~~  
~~

3\. Recorded cell counts inspreadsheet

  

Flask 11244

Volume = 74.5 mL

Density: 1.088M cells/mL

Total number of cells: 81.056M

Use 5 mL of this to seed E5000 (~5M cells)  

Use 3 mL of this to seed E250 (~3M cells)

66.5 mL leftover to pellet / freeze

  

Flask 11245

Volume = 73.5 mL

Density: 1.292M cells/mL

Total number of cells: 94.962M

Use all of this to seed E5000 (~95M)

  

Centrifuge at 300g for 10 min

Wash with PBS once

Centrifuge again

Freeze pellet




Prepare materials for passage and seed (E5000):

1\. Aliquotted the required volume of each reagent in the table above. Growth
media (for seeding):   ~1921.5 mL and added growth factors

2\. Added media to water bath and incubated at 37degC

Time that aliquot was placed in the incubator to warm before use:   12:15 -
15:15  

3\. Added media to E5000 shake flask and incubated at 37degC in incubator to
equilibrate media (as per SOP, attached).

  

Placed in incubator at: 15:45

Culture kept in shaking incubator 146

Placed in incubator at: 16:00

Culture kept in shaking incubator 159? (On top of incubator 146)

  




SOPs used:

  * Quail suspension cell tech transfer SOP (attached)

  

Summary:  

  * Passaged 2 x E250s into 1 x E5000 (ST1, E2) and 1 x E250 (ST2, E1) - seeding density = 50,000 cells/mL
  * E5000 is a bit frothy - just making a note
  * Pellet frozen and stored in fridge 42 (main lab)
