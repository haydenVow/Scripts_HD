Process


XTT preparation (done in the dark)

  1. Removed XTT assay stock kits in -20 freezer in Main Lab (area on freezer door labelled "kits") 
  2. Removed 3 x packages containing 3 x bottles of XTT reagent and 3 x vials of the Electron coupling reagent from the CyQuant XTT Cell viability Assay kit. Returned the rest of the kit to the freezer. 
  3. Thawed the XTT reagents (component A) in the water bath at 37ºC. Vortexed the bottle to ensure the XTT reagent is fully in solution
  4. Thawed the Electron coupling reagents at room temperature. Vortexed the vial to ensure that the reagent is fully in solution. 
  5. Aspirated full volume (6 mL per vial) of XTT reagents and dispensed into trough for multi-channel pipetting
  6. Added full volume (1 mL per vial) of electron coupling reagents to XTT reagent in trough
  7. Mix the working solution in the trough by pipetting. Working solution should be used immediately.

Cell labelling and absorbance reading

  1. Immediately following sample preparation, removed well plate(s) from the incubator and added 70 uL (96-wp) ~~or 35 uL (384-wp)  ~~of the working XTT solution directly to each test and blank well of the 96 well plate using a multichannel pipette.

  2. Incubated the wells at 37ºC for 4 hours. 12:05 - 16:14

  3. After incubation, ran XTT protocol on the SPECTROstar Nano Absorbance Reader for each plate (remove plate lids before placing in plate reader) 

  4. Labelled each CSV data file (plate 1, plate 2, plate 3, plate 4) and sent to Lily on slack
  5. Replaced plates in incubator to be read again at 24H
