2\. Aliquotted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then
placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath for a minimum of 20 minutes
prior to use: Reagents warmed to 28 degrees C

  *  Growth media (for seeding):    3 mL
  *  Growth media (for feed):   3  mL
  * Time that aliquots were placed in the water bath to warm before use:   12:14

  




## Thaw and seed vial:

3\. Collected the cryovial from -80C storage & place in foam floater in 28
degrees Celsius water bath for 5 min  13:09

Location where cryovial was collected from:

Vial details:  1   x  raw isolate (CHOMP1)  cryovials at   unknown  cells each
for a total of   unknown  cells

-80C freeze - library lab ID #64

Vial ID(s): 3287-Culture-7378-Vial-1of4

4.Ethenol sprayed and transferred the vial to the BSC.

5\. Added 500ul of Growth media and resuspended the cells gently to reduce
osmotic shock.

6\. Collected the entire 1ml of cell suspension and transferred into the pre-
warmed growth media.

7\. Using P1000, resuspended and distributed the cells evenly in the 3mL of
pre-warmed growth media

8\. Transferred the cell suspension to 1 well of a 6-well plate

`9. Transferred flask/plate(s) to incubate at: `13:19`  
`

  * [X  ]  28ÂºC, 5% CO2 (reptilian cells)

Making labels

Note - These cells are labelled as "F_CHOMP1" as we are attempting to allow
fibroblasts to adhere by not gelatin coating the vessel, and performing a 100%
feed 4 hours after seeding.




100% Feed:

  1. After 4 hours of incubation, culture removed from incubator. 
  2. 3mL of pre-warmed Growth Media collected and taken to BSC.   17:15
  3. Entire supernatant was transferred to another well (labelled "supernatant") in the 6-well plate well.
  4. 3mL pre-warmed Growth media added gently to the original well (labelled "pre-plate").
  5. Plate returned to incubate at 28C, 5% CO2.   17:20




SOPs used:

  * Thaw/Revival Template_V3

  

Summary: Much debris was observed in both wells, there were no cells obviously
adhered to the "pre-plate" well.
