AIM/PURPOSE: Determine if the addition of Vitamin C (L-ascorbic acid) during
cell seeding or post 4 days after seeding, affects the proliferation and/or
aggregation of Nuvonis quail fibroblast suspension cells.

HYPOTHESIS: Inclusion of Vitamin C (L-ascorbic acid) during cell seeding will
increase the proliferation rate of Nuvonis suspension cells. In addition it's
addition after the cells have been in culture for 3 days post seeding will
result in the formation of aggregates and production of ECM mass.

RESULTS SUMMARY:

Figure 1: Weight of harvested Nuvonis cell pellets. Each data point represents
an individual sample with the average calculated from triplicate samples (n=3)
+/- SEM.

CONCLUSIONS:

No significant differences were observed between any of the conditions
evaluated. Moreover, it is inconclusive to determine if Vitamin C treating or
seeding results in a higher cell pellet weight due to the variances observed
between technical replicates.

NEXT STEPS:

  * Repeat this experiment with additional technical replicates to determine if the variance observed between replicates is an effect of the Vitamin C.
  * Increase the duration the cells are cultured in Vitamin C, >7 days.
  * Treat cultures with cell density >1M cells/mL with Vitamin C over an extended period, > 7 days.
