Aim


To further explore potential biomaterial candidates


Hypothesis


Due to the different properties required in the final scaffold, more than one
biomaterial will be needed to create the final bioink.


Method


1\. Hydrate various biomaterials.

2\. Add in different additives to adjust gelling temperature and stability in
liquid.

3.Cast in moulds/extrude and set.

3a. Determine resolution of print, idea of viscosity, shear thinning

3\. Cut slices and determine porosity, diffusion ability.

Observations

Hydrating materials - Chitosan did not dissolve and remained in large
particulates, as such for the time being I decided to exclude this from the
biomaterial experimental until its dissolution can be optimised. The order of
hydration is important to ensure a smooth consistency, in this experiment I
hydrated them as such: 1. Agarose (in microwave) 2. Methyl Cellulose (stirred
in while warm) 3. Biomaterial candidate (stirred in while warm), during this
process the biogels were kept in a 40C water bath. Once mixed together, they
were left at room temp overnight to see if further hydration occurs.
Improvements to be made: Change the order of hydration to the following: 1.
Methyl cellulose (stirred in chilled ice water) 2. Bring to 60C and add in
Agarose (dissolve in microwave) 3. Biomaterial candidate.

Hydration overnight - Biogels hydrated further overnight to create a
consistent biogel. The agarose component did set the biogels to some degree
but this was easily broken by stirring.

Dispensing - The biogels could be dispense through an 18G needle, however a
large amount of force was needed with some shear thinning occurring. When
needle was removed, biogels were able to dispense easily from the syringe
creating noodle like extrusions.

Stability in water - Glucomannan strands left overnight in water retain
structure but became swollen, when they were removed from the solution they
collapsed into a viscous puddle. Strands of the remaining biomaterials were
created and placed in a 24WP and left in water overnight, although after 1 hr
swelling was observed in all strands except for Alginate 2 & 4% crosslinked
with calcium. After 2 hrs the uncrosslinked alginate strands had already begun
to break apart and dissipate into the water, the other biogels stayed in
strand form but became swollen.

After 24 hrs, only the crosslinked alginate retained its shape with acceptable
levels of swelling. The carageenan swelled into a mass but retained its
structure to some degree, the xanthan gum began to break apart. From these
observations, it seems a crosslinker is required to stabilise the gels in
liquid.

  


Conclusion


Candidates to be taken forward:  
\- Alginate 2% Crosslinked

\- Glucomannan

\- Carageenan
