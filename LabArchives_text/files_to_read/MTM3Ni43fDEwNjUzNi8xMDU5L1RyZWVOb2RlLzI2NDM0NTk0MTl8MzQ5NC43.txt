Fibroblasts - CHOMP07

Batch Total Weight: 472.06g

  

Batch Objectives/Outline:

  * Produce as much mass as possible for investor tastings

  

Batch Timeline (Proliferation days in each passage & Flask no./type):

Passage NumberProliferation daysFlask No./Type  
P162x10CF, 2x4CF  
P2615x10CF,1x4CF,1x2CF  
P32232x10CF,16x5CS  
  
  

Notable Events:

  * Flasks did not peel within the expected time frame
    * For this reason their harvest date was extended from the 04/03 to the 07/03 with a few flasks being extended even further to the 09/03
    * Even at these extended harvest dates not all layers had sufficiently peeled so TrypLE was used to remove these layers. 
  * 5CS appeared to peel faster than 10CS, there was no obvious/observable reason for this

Batch/Experiment Results:

  * 472.06g was achieved from the equivalent of 40x10CS
    * Note: This weight may be slightly inflated by the higher water content in the cell pellet after using TrypLE
  * This equates to ~11.8g per 10CS  

Achievements:

  * Largest batch and harvest EVER!!
  * First batch with CHOMP 07
