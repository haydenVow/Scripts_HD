### Process:

1\. Took image of vessel with microscope on phase setting.

2\. Gelatin coated    1      x    2CF      vessel    with sterile filtered
0.1% gelatin solution and then incubated all coated flasks at 37˚C.

  1. Time when all vessels(s) placed into the incubator     13:00  \- 15:30  

3\. Aliquotted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then
placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath for a minimum of 20 minutes
prior to use:

  1. TrypLE:     30    mL in     1x 50 mL    tube
  2.  dPBS (At 37 degrees for washing):     30    mL in    1x 50 mL    tube
  3.  dPBS (at RT neutralising):     30    mL in    1x 50 mL    tube
  4. Growth media (for pellet resuspension):     5    mL in     15 mL    tubes
  5. Growth media (for seeding):     300    mL in   pre-aliquoted media container 

Time that all aliquots were placed in the water bath the warm before use
14:00

Note: if aliquots were placed in water bath at different time, record the time
stamp for each individual solution.




4\. Removed vessel(s) from the incubator  15:35

5\. Washed the vessel(s) with dPBS (warmed).

6\. Added     10    mL tryple to each vessel/well and incubated at 37˚C.

  1. Start/Finish for TrypLE was   15:50 - 16:00 

7\. Neutralised each T175 with     10     dPBS and combined cell suspension
into 2x     50mL    tube.

8\. Centrifuged at 650 x g for 5 min.

  1. Start/Finish time for centrifugation was    16:08 - 16:13 




9\. Aspirated the supernatant(s).

10\. Resuspended pellet(s) in     2.5    mL per tube of  growth       media
16:15  

11\. Aliquoted      20uL    of resuspended cells into a microcentrifuge tube
for cell count.

12\. Performed a cell count using the haemocytometer and recorded the cell
count data in the Google Doc spreadsheet called 'Cell Count Spreadsheet' (see
link below):

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1DPzKubYxfHmWogVPihC-
SSIBtIylyrBQE5kRX5Z8NtI/edit#gid=0

  1.  Total cell number was:    6,120,000         

  2. Volume of cell suspension required for subculture was:      1.63mL       

  3. Cell density per vessel:     2,000,000  cells per 1x 2CF       




13\. Transferred       1630    ul of cell suspension to the pre-warmed
300    mL Growth media:      16:50  

14\. Transferred cell suspension into the pre-gelatin coated       16:52
vessel.

15\. Left at RT in the BSC for 30 min to allow cells to settle     16:55 -
17:25  

16\. Transferred vessel(s) to incubate at: 17:30

  * [x]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells) thermo incubator
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (avian cells)
