Harvested the cells

Decision was made not to harvest cells due to extremely low confluence - see
lab notebook for analysis: https://au-

  1.  ~~Cells detached according to protocol.~~
  2. Logging stopped.
  3. Temperature control stopped.
  4. pH control stopped.
  5. Dissolved oxygen control stopped.
  6. Level control stopped.
  7. Manual aeration and stirring maintained.
  8. Supernatant pumped out of bioreactor and into waste vessel.
  9. Aseptically transferred remaining growth medium in feed bottle to 2 x 500 mL pots and stored in fridge.

NotesConsider having a separate long-line bottle for PBS and Trypsin because
the feed bottle will often contain residual growth medium.  
  
  
  
  




Turned off the gas supply

  1. Turned off the aeration and any other gases.
  2. Turned all of the gas supply regulators to 0 pressure.

Decontaminated bioreactor

  1. Filled all connected bottles with 100 mL of 70% ethanol
  2. Pumped the 70% ethanol through the tubing and into the bioreactor
  3. Cut off the tip of the sampling tube and discarded.
  4. Pumped 50 mL of 70% ethanol back through the sample tube.
  5. Disconnected and removed the pH probe:
    1. Wiped with 70% ethanol
    2. Rinsed with water
    3. Wiped with a lint-free cloth
    4. Filled the storage cap with3.5 M KCl
    5. Replaced the storage cap and stored the probe upright
  6. Disconnected and removed the DO probe:
    1. Wiped with 70% ethanol
    2. Rinsed with water
    3. Wiped with a lint-free cloth
    4. Filled the storage cap with tap water
    5. Replaced the storage cap and stored the probe upright
  7. Disconnected and removed the level probe:
    1. Wiped with 70% ethanol
    2. Rinsed with water
    3. Wiped with a lint-free cloth
    4. Stored the probe in a thickly-padded foam box
  8. Pumped the 70% ethanol out of the bioreactor and into an empty waste bottle.

Cleaned the bioreactor vessel  

  1. Added pH neutral, non-corrosive, bacteriostatic cleaning agent to the bioreactor, filling all the way to the headplate.
  2. Left the stirrer on overnight.
