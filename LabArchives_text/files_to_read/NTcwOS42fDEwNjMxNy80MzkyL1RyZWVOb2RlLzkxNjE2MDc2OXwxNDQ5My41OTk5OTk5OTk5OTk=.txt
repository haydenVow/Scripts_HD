Media/Reagents used:

NameDetailsVolume used (mL)  
D/F +10% FBS +1xP/Sm6934  
7 mL  
  
P38i (20mM stock)m7354  
3.5 uL  
  
D/F+20% FBS +1xP/Sm7186  
7 mL  
  
  
  




Process:

  1. Aliquotted  7 mL mL of each media listed below into 2 x 15 mL tubes:
    1. D/F + 20%FBS + 1xP/S
    2. D/F + 10%FBS + 1xP/S
  2. Added   3.5 uL  mL of p38i only to D/F + 20%FBS + 1xP/S aliquot only. 
    1. P38i is located in the -20 freezer, top drawer, in 70 mL pot with a yellow lid. Check the mix ID - it should be 5607. Note: There is also a growth factor called P53i so be careful to not take this one by accident! 
    2. Remove 1 aliquot from the pot, let it thaw in your hand. Once the entire aliquot has thawed, add 3.5 uL to the D/F + 20%FBS + 1xP/S medium aliquot. Add a dot to the outside of the aliquot lid using a marker (if there is not already a dot present), and replace in pot in -20 freezer) 
  3. Placed in water bath    12:30 a/pm 
  4. Removed   1.5 mL  of supernatant from each well of both plates (used a different tip for each well). 
  5. Replaced with  1.5 mL per well of  respective media (can use same tip if you don't touch the media).
    1. DOLLY12 receives D/F + 20%FBS + 1xP/S + P38i
    2. NANDO3 receives D/F + 10%FBS + 1xP/S
  6. Returned vessel to incubate at:

  * [X]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (aviary cells)

  

  * Incubator (68), Lab [Main/Library/Production]




### Observations/Summary:

50  % media changed on vessel(s)  

8309-F_NANDO3-Chicken P7-1of1

8310-F_DOLLY12_3P23-Sheep P8-1of1

  

Most cells appear to be senescing. Only culture with some regular looking
cells is NANDO without P53i and without UV exposure.

Strange debris (green spikey spheres) observed in + P53i in both species

Rod-shaped debris seen in all cultures with P53i
