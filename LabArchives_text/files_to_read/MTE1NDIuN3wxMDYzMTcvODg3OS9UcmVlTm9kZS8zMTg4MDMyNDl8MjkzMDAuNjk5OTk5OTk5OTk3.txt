Methods and Experiment Layout


Aim 1: Determine how well tissues form in the new mould design with removable
pillars, to provide a number of these tissues to the product team for tasting,
texture analysis and other sensory assessments.

Aim 2: To investigate the effect of TGFb on inducing ECM deposition and tissue
stiffening in Nuvonis mini-tissues.  
  
Experiment Plan

We will seed four moulds with 12 tissues at a cell density of 40 million cells
per mL (finding of current max density with "well-formed" tissues from
experiment 4). Tissues will be cultured for 5 days in Pen/Strep, changed to
P/S free media for 2 days and harvested after 7 days. Tissues will be treated
with TGF-beta and Vitamin C to induce ECM deposition and tissue "stiffening".
Tissues will be used for immunoanalysis, flow cytometry, molecular analysis
and product testing.

TGF-beta (stock @ 20ug/mL) concentrations:

  * 10ng/ml = 1:2000 = 100ul in 200mL
  * 20ng/ml = 1:1000 = 200ul in 200mL
  * 50ng/ml = 1:400 = 500ul in 200mL\

Vitamin C concentration: 100ug/ml = 1:1000

  6. Resuspend pellets in the growth media in the following volumes. 
    1. 40M/mL = 1.92M cells (for 12x tissues exactly), and 7.68Bn for (12 tissues x 4 scaffolds = 48 tissues) = 92.93mL
  7. Bring out matrix additives from the fridge and proceed to matrix additions below.  
    1.  ~~Bring out ice box from the -80 freezer.  ~~

  

## Matrix formation for scaffold seeding -

N.B. Repeat this gel formation for each falcon tube at the same time - i.e.
Add Collagen to all, then add DMEM to all etc. - BUT be sure to move quickly!
Refer to Figure 2 to visualise the workflow.

1. Remove pluronic from the wells.

Condition: 40M cells/mL (n=12) per condition (mL)  
Step 1. Aliquot cells+media for 1 condition  
(n=3 tissues)23.23  
 Step 2. Add total Collagen (mL)  
19.49  
Step 3. Add total 10xDMEM/F12  
  
(mL)2.35  
Step 4. Add total 0.1M NaOH  
(mL)2.93  
Step 5. Pipette matrix into each well  
(mL)4  
  
2\. Add Collagen I (Devro: final concentration 2.6mg/ml) and mix well with
stripette (not resuspending!):

3\. Add 10xDMEM/F12 and mix with stripette.

4\. Add 0.1M Sodium Hydroxide and mix with stripette:

5\. Seed    4mL    gel/matrix gently into scaffold ensuring good distribution
around pillars in the well. Repeat for each treatment condition plate.

6. Leave for    60-90    minutes to gel at 37°C - start time   15:53   

7\. Add   ~150-200mL   50-50 Media with or w/o TGF-b to entire 15mL dish,
ensure entire mould is covered.

8. Culture at 37°C overnight before checking.

# Tips and Tricks for this Protocol:

  * When pelleting cells, make sure they are completely dry
  * Flick pellet to dislodge before adding medium
  * Add Medium first to pellet to prevent clumping and cell death
  * Col1 is very viscous, pipette carefully - when adding 10x DMEM, it turns yellow
  * As soon as you add the NaOH, be quick as the Col starts to gel
  * Everything has to be exact, don't be tempted to add more cells than the volume stated if there are some left
  * Add cells slowly!
