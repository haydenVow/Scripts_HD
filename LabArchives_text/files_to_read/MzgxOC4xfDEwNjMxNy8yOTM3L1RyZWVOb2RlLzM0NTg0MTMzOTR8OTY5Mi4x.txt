Process:

  1. Place pre-aliquotted growth media (fridge #104 library lab)   20mL  in water bath  10:58 
  2. Using 1 tip per well to ensure there isn't any cross over between wells, removed  50 % of supernatant from vessel.  
(aspirate 250uL/well from each well of the 24-well plates, and 1.5mL/well from
each well of the 6-well plate)

Note*** the same tip can be used to add to every well IF the tip doesn't touch
the media inside the wells (so that media isn't shared between wells). If a
tip touches a well or if there is any splash back from the well to the tip,
replace and continue with a fresh tip to ensure there isn't any cell-exposed
media going back into the tube with fresh warm media.  

  1. Added  0.25 mL (per well) of  warm Growth media to each well containing cells in the 24-well plates. 
  2. Added  1.5 mL (per well) of  warm Growth media to each well containing cells in the 6-well plate. 
  3. Returned vessel to incubate at: 12:08 pm
