Aim/Purpose


Determine if treating Nuvonis quail fibroblast suspension cells with Vitamin C
(50 ug/mL) across 8 days in continuous culture results in an increase in cell
mass yield


Hypothesis


Addition of Vitamin C during the 8 day culturing period of the Nuvonis
suspension cells will result in an increase in pellet weight following
harvesting


Technical Gap


Previous experimental with DOLLY_12 and CHOMP_09 fibroblasts demonstrated that
treating cells with Vitamin C (L-ascorbic acid) resulted in enhancing the
production of ECM protein and subsequent aggregation of adherent cultures. In
addition this aggregation resulted in a texture that was more meat-like during
the product team testing demonstrations. Replicating this finding with quail
fibroblast cells in suspension can result in a greater product yield due to
the increase in ECM production. Therefore, this experiment will determine if
the addition of Vitamin C during 8 days of culturing is sufficient to an
increase in ECM production and subsequent increase in yield.


Method/Procedure


Process:

  1. Seed 16x E250 flasks at 50,000 cells/mL (total volume 50 mL - 2,500,000 cells per flask, 40,000,000 million cells total) in the following conditions:
    1. Control n=8 (Hycell CHO suspension media without Vitamin C, see below)
    2. Treatment n=8 (Hycell CHO suspension with Vitamin C, see below)  
  
Growth Media:  
• Hycell CHO (25.4 g/L Hycell CHO powder + 2.2 g/L sodium bicarbonate + 1g/L
Poloxamer 188)  
• Difco Yeast Extract UF, 1g/l: add 10 ml YE stock (100g/l) per liter medium  
• L-Ornithine monohydrochloride, 20 mg/l; add 1 ml stock (20 mg/ml) per liter
medium  
• Putrescine dihydrochloride, 20 mg/l; add 1 ml stock (20 mg/ml) per liter
medium  
• IGF-1 LONG R3, 50 μg/l; add 50 μl stock (1 mg/ml) per liter medium  
• EGF, 10 μg/l; add 10 μl stock (1 mg/ml) per liter medium  
• Anti-clumping agent, 1:100; add 10 ml stock per liter medium  
• Glutamax, 1:50; add 20 mL stock per litre medium  
• Vitamin C (L-ascorbic acid) 50ug/mL - only required for the treatment group

  2. Leave the cells in culture for a period of 4 days
  3. On the fourth day, harvest each of the cell suspensions
    1. Weigh out 16x 50 mL tubes
    2. Transfer cell suspension in centrifuge tubes
    3. Spin at 300 x g for 10 mins
    4. Remove supernatant, being careful not to disrupt the pellet
    5. Weigh each tube and calculate cell mass weight using the difference between the empty tube and the tube weighed with cells in it.
    6. Resuspend each of the cell pellets in fresh growth media and transfer each cell suspension in a separate shake flask
  4. Leave the flasks in culture for an additional 4 days
  5. On the eighth day repeat step 3 for a final pellet weighing
