Aim/Purpose


To determine whether the previously experienced lack of MyoG and MG20 staining
on zein is the result of the scaffold material, cell type or antibody/staining
protocol used.  


Hypothesis


1) We will be able to visualise differentiation of C2C12 and DOLLY12 cells on
planar culture but not on zein scaffolds (based on previous findings).

2) A 1:500 dilution of secondary antibodies will produce stronger signals from
MyoG and MF20 than a 1:1000 dilution, enabling us to visualise antibody
staining on zein


Technical Gap


Despite maintaining high scaffold confluence by day 14 in differentiation
media we are yet to seen any positive verification of differentiation through
antibody staining (MyoG or MF20) on our in-house zein scaffolds (such as in
this experiment: https://au-
mynotebook.labarchives.com/share/Vow%2520-%2520Team%2520Science/MTk3Ni4wfDEwNjMxNy8xNTIwL1RyZWVOb2RlLzI2NTQ2NDg4MDh8NTAxNi4w).
We are unsure as to whether this is due to the zein material, the DOLLY12
cells, the antibodies/staining protocol, or a combination of these factors.


Method/Procedure


Experiment plan/timeline
