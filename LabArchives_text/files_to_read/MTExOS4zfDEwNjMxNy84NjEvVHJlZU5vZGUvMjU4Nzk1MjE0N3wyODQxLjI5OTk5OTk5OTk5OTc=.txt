Process:

  1. Set up OT2 deck as follows:
    1. OT2 filter 200uL tip rack in positions 10
    2. NEST 1x well reservoirs in positions 7
    3. NEST 12 well reservoirs in positions 4, 5, and 6 each containing:
      1. 9.5 mL PBS in wells 1-6
    4. 96 well plates in positions 1, 2, and 3
  2. Run the following protocol: YYYY-MM-DD-num-N-wash-3-plates
    1. start time: 12:57:27 PM
    2. run time:   1:13:37  hours
  3. Prepare 12mL of the secondary antibody mix (Goat anti-mouse IgG1 AF488, 1:1000)
    1. 12 mL of blocking buffer + 12uL Goat anti-mouse IgG1 AF488 (centrifuge before use)
    2. store in fridge until use 14:01
  4. Prepare 30 ml of DAPI (1:1000 in PBS) and store in the fridge 13:54
  5. Manually remove PBS from wells and add 50uL/well of secondary antibody mix. 
  6. incubate in the dark for 1 hour at room temp 13:25 - 14:25
  7. Set up OT2 deck as follows:
    1. OT2 filter 200uL tip rack in positions 10
    2. NEST 1x well reservoirs in positions 7
    3. NEST 12 well reservoirs in positions 4, 5, and 6 each containing:
      1. 9.5 mL DAPI (1:1000 in PBS) in wells 1
      2. 9.5 mL PBS in wells 2 - 6
    4. 96 well plates in positions 1, 2, and 3
  8. Run the following protocol: YYYY-MM-DD-num-N-dapi-3-plates
    1. start time: 3:32:16 PM
    2. run time:  not recorded   hours
  9. Parafilm plate and store overnight in the fridge (4 degrees C). ~ 17 : 15
