Process:

1\. Aliquotted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then
placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath (30C) for a minimum of 20
minutes prior to use

  1.  Growth media (for seeding):    60 mL in   1 tub 
  2.  Time that all aliquot was placed in the water bath to warm before use:   11:57

2\. Collected the cryovial from Liquid Nitrogen storage & place in foam
floater in water bath for 2 min 12:15

Location where cryovial was collected from:

 Homer  OR Dewer 1

Tower/Bucket # 6  

Box/Cane # 4

Vial location:B9,C1,C2,C3

3\. Ethanol sprayed & transferred the vial(s) to the BSC.

4\. Added  500µL of Growth Media (to generate a total volume of 1mL in the
cryovial) to the cryovial, resuspended the cell suspension gently to reduce
osmotic shock.

5\. Collected the entire 1mL of cell suspension & transfer into the pre-warmed
tube of Growth Media.




6\. Using a 10mL serological pipette, resuspended & distributed the cells
evenly in the   60mL of pre-warmed Growth Media (prepared in Step 2).

7\. Seeded cells into (non-gelatin coated) flasks/wells at approximately 7k
cells per cm2.

  1. e.g. 1 million fibroblasts can be seeded into 1 x T175

8\. Transfered  30mL to each   T175 flask/well.

9\. Transfered flask/plate(s) to incubate at: 12:21

  * [x]  30ºC, 5% CO2 (Reptillian cells)
