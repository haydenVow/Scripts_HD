Experiment Plan:




Procedure - 50% Feed in Roller Bottles

  1. Remove the flask from the incubator. 
  2. Spray a disposable wipe with 70%EtOH and wipe the exterior of the roller bottle and transfer into the BSC. 
  3. Remove 100mL media using a 50mL serological pipette, ensuring not to touch the edges of the bottle. 
  4. Save the discarded media and perform a pH test. Range (7.0-7.4)
  5. Replace discarded media with 100mL pre-warmed growth media. 
  6. Immediately return to the incubator. 
  7. Repeat steps 1-6 for each subsequent roller bottle.

* Bottle C: Growth media with VitC (50ug/mL)

  

Procedure - 100% VitC Treatment

* Bottle B: 100% VitC treatment  

  1. Remove the flask from the incubator. 
  2. Spray a disposable wipe with 70%EtOH and wipe the exterior of the roller bottle and transfer into the BSC. 
  3. Remove all media using a 50mL serological pipette, ensuring not to touch the edges of the bottle. 
  4. Save the discarded media and perform a pH test. Range (7.0-7.4)
  5. Replace discarded media with 200mL pre-warmed growth media containing VitC (50ug/mL). 
  6. Immediately return to the incubator. 
  7. Repeat steps 1-6 for each subsequent roller bottle.
