Took samples

  1. Unscrewed the "BENCHMARK" sample tube cover.
  2. Sprayed down the tube end with 70% ethanol.
  3. Connected a 5 mL sterile syringe.
  4. Withdrew slightly more than 3 mL (to purge the line).
  5. Discarded the 5 mL syringe.
  6. Connected a fresh sterile syringe and withdrew 3.5 - 4.0 mL of sample.
  7. Disconnected sample syringe and transferred 1 mL of sample each to 3 x 1.5 mL Eppendorf tubes for subsequent analysis:
    * Performed ViCell count: 320k live cells/mL, 90.7% viability
    * Performed manual cell count: 280k live cells/mL, 62% viability
    * Tested pH offline: 7.52
    * Prepared sample for offline biochemistry analyses: "Biostat 11-July" placed in red rack
      * 250uL taken from sample
      * diluted 1:2 with equal volume of dH2O (not PBS) 
      * Quick spin for 1 minute
      * Reserve supernatant in new 1.5mL tube and discarded pellet. Input sample info into datasheet here for later analysis offsite. Stored in sample box at -20degC
  8. Sprayed sample tube end and cap with 70% ethanol, re-attached cap.

  1. Took samples for genetic drift and other tests: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1YQIYn9VxPIqxVvu8pe9fudyDBRnuDsATzeaQwLhl0eg/edit#gid=1162240706&range=16:21
  2. Prepared fresh growth medium with ingredients shown in the table below
  3. Pumped out 1 L of broth and transfer to 4x 250 mL centrifuge tubes
  4. Centrifuged for 1 minute at 1200 RCF
  5. Pumped 1 L of fresh growth medium into the bioreactor

### Observations/Summary: Cell count has increased from ~50k cells/mL on day 0
to ~320k cells/mL on day 5, corresponding to 1 day lag time and 1.5 day
doubling time, which is a bit slow normal. Cells should be ready for draw-and-
fill on Monday 18 July.
