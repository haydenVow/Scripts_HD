Performed by: EC LL
Equipment

  1. 9 x non-treated 96-WPs (in cabinet below OT2) 
  2. Hoechst solution 
  3. Sytox green/Nuc green solution 
  4. Non-sterile dPBS 


Process

  1. Prepared 7 mL of Hoechst solution (50 ug/mL / 1:20 dilution of 1 mg/mL stock in MilliQ). Stored in light-safe tube until ready to use. 
  2. Prepared 25 mL of Sytox/Nuc Green solution (1 drop stock per 1 mL dPBS). Store in light-safe tube until ready to use.
  3. Started up "Fox" OT2 and loaded "DSD 2 Staining 1" protocol attached below 
  4. Set up deck as specified in protocol
  5. Added non-sterile dPBS, Hoechst and Sytox to 12-well reservoir ("Media Vessel") as specified below
    *         A1 of Media Vessel #1 on 1 : Media 1 - dPBS : 12000.00 uL
        A2 of Media Vessel #1 on 1 : Media 1 - dPBS : 12000.00 uL
        A3 of Media Vessel #1 on 1 : Media 1 - dPBS : 8000.00 uL
        A4 of Media Vessel #1 on 1 : Media 2 - Hoechst : 3400.00 uL
        A5 of Media Vessel #1 on 1 : Media 3 - Sytox : 12000.00 uL
        A6 of Media Vessel #1 on 1 : Media 3 - Sytox : 800.00 uL

  6. Ran deck calibration 
  7. Started protocol 
    1. Start time: 10:36:36 AM
    2. Time first cells added to stain: 10:50
    3. Time paused: 11:00 (~24 min)
      * When protocol paused, replaced empty pipette boxes with 2 x full pipette boxes on spots 10 & 11, waited until 11:10 (20 min after first samples stained) then clicked "resume" 
    4. Run time: 00:45:47
  8. Once first plate has had serial dilutions performed by OT2, removed plate and began imaging on main lab Zaber microscope (DAPI & AF488) 
    * Remembered to name plate with it's number in the "notes" section e.g. Plate 1, Plate 2 etc. Alternatively, make separate culture IDs for each staining plate. 
  9. As each plate finished, removed from OT2 and place in box to protect from light, then imaged in order that they were stained (Plate 1 then Plate 2 etc.)
  10. Left OT2 as is until imaging session for Plate 4 was started, then set up OT2 for second staining run (protocol attached below)
  11. Added non-sterile dPBS, Hoechst and Sytox to 12-well reservoir ("Media Vessel") as specified below. 
    *         A1 of Media Vessel #1 on 2 : Media 1 - dPBS : 12000.00 uL
        A2 of Media Vessel #1 on 2 : Media 1 - dPBS : 12000.00 uL
        A3 of Media Vessel #1 on 2 : Media 1 - dPBS : 1600.00 uL
        A4 of Media Vessel #1 on 2 : Media 2 - Hoechst : 2560.00 uL
        A5 of Media Vessel #1 on 2 : Media 3 - Sytox : 10240.00 uL

  12. Ran deck calibration 
  13. Started protocol 
    1. Start time: 12:50:27 PM 
    2. Time first cells added to stain: 13:01
    3. Time paused: 13:10 (~20 min)
      * When protocol paused, replaced empty pipette boxes with 2 x full pipette boxes on spots 10 & 11, waited until 13:20 (20 min after first samples stained) then clicked "resume" 
    4. Run time: 00:43:51
  14. Once first plate has had serial dilutions performed by OT2, removed plate and began imaging on main lab Zaber microscope (DAPI & AF488) 
  15. As each plate finished, removed from OT2 and place in box to protect from light, then imaged in order that they were stained (Plate 6 then Plate 7 etc.) 
  16. Shut down and cleaned OT2
