Experiment Plan:

  




Last night I discovered that the TGFb we have been using in all batches for Q3
2021 has been re-constituted using instructions from a slightly different
version of the same product. The instructions for the two products are
significantly different and may have lead to all of the difficulties we have
so far experienced with the use of TGFb and premature peeling in our treated
cultures.

The instructions we used were based off Peprotech product code #100-21

However, the product we are actually using is Peprotech product code #100-21C

I have attached the two sets of reconstitution instruction below for future
reference.




In response to the above findings, we have determined that we need to take the
following actions today (immediately):

  1. Warm up fresh DMEM/F12 10% FBS media (800 mL), vitamin C aliquot and dPBS (~400 mL) in water bath - 08:43 am
  2. Made DMEM/F12 10% FBS+Vitamin C media
  3. Removed all media from the bottles
  4. Carefully added 100 mL dPBS to each bottle and gently washed the surfaces of each bottle to further dilute the presence of the old TGFb containing media
  5. Removed the dPBS and added the fresh DMEM/F12+10% FBS+VitaminC media
  6. Resumed incubation of the flasks while we made a fresh batch of TGFb stock from lyophilised powder
  7. Once the TGFb stock has been made, added the appropriate volume of TGFb to each bottle directly and mixed gently
  8. Resumed incubation of the bottles on the roller apparatus as per the experimental plan (0.5 rpm, 37C 5% CO2) for up to a total of 17 days in the roller bottles (including the 7 days of proliferation before treatment)
