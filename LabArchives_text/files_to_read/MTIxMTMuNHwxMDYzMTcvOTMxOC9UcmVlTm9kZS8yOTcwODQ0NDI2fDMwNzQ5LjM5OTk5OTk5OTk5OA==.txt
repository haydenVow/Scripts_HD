  1. Added IGF and EGF to 120 mL of growth medium 
  2. Place aliquot in incubator or water bath to warm 
  3. Add 200 uL of sterile dPBS to wells of both ULA 96-well plates as specified in plate map below
  4. Perform cell count on continuous culture vessel being used for seeding (most likely will be taking cells from MFG)
  5. Transfer aliquot containing 24M cells from continuous culture vessel to falcon tube 
  6. Centrifuge for 5 min at 500 x g 
  7. Aspirate supernatant 
  8. Re-suspend in 125 mL of warm growth medium (200K cells/mL) 
  9. Transfer cell suspension as follows: 
    1. 30 mL to each of 3 x E125s
    2. 5 mL to each of 3 x 50 mL bioreactor tubes 
    3. 200 uL to each of 21 x wells in 2 x ULA 96-well plate as shown in plate map below
  10. Incubate E125s at 37'C, 120 RPM
  11. Incubate E125s at 37'C, 205 RPM
  12. Incubate ULA 96-wps at 37'C, 0 RPM (no agitation)
