  1. Took 2 x 560 uL samples from each culture (2 x technical reps/flask).
  2. Performed counts using Vicell (560 uL/sample):

  3. Aliquotted 60 mL of;  
(1) CHO Part A + Nuvonis  
  
and, added 60uL of IGF and 12 uL of EGF to each aliquot.  
  

  4. Aliquoted the following mL of cell suspension into 6 x 15 mL tubes, out of which every 2 will come from the same culture and contain the same volume of cell suspension:

  5. Centrifuged the tubes @ 500 xg for 5 minutes.
  6. Added 20 mL of each pre-warmed media into each E-125.
  7. After centrifugation, aspirated the supernatant and resuspended cell pellet in 1 mL of respective medium using a 1 mL pipette. Then dispensed cell suspension into its respective E-125.
  8. Replaced E125 in incubator at 37'C, 5% CO2, 120 RPM
