### Process:

1\. Took image of wells that appeared over 100% confluent or had started
peeling. Generated a clone pick list for the following clones.

ZIC1 clones to pick IGFBP4 clones to pick  
1E4F  
1F4B  
3B3E  
3C3F  
2C4C  
2E4D  
2F  
  
  
  1. Filled 14 wells on 6 well plates with growth media and placed them into the incubator at 30 degrees to warm up. 




  

5\. Discarded supernatant from the wells containing the above clones, washed
each with 1mL of dPBS

6\. Added     1    mL tryple to each vessel/well and incubated at 30ËšC. for 8
minutes

7\. Neutralised with     1mL of     dPBS and collected each clonal population
in separate 15mL tubes. Returned the passaged plates back to the incubator
(82, 30 degrees C, 5% CO2)

8\. Centrifuged at 500 x g for 5 min.




9\. Aspirated the supernatant(s).

10\. Resuspended pellet(s) in growth media, 600uL for each ZIC1 clone and
300uL for each IGFBP4 clone.  

11\. Removed the destination plates from the incubator. Transferred 1/3 of the
resuspended cell volume for each clone to a separate well on the new
destination plates.  

12\. Returned the plates to incubate at 30 degrees in incubator 82 in the main
lab.
