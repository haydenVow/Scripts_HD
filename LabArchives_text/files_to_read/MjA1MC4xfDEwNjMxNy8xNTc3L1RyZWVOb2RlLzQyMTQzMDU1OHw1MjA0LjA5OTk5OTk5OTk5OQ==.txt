Growth Media:

  * [X]  DMEM/F12 + 20% FBS + 1X P/S + P38i (10uM)

  

Prepare materials for thaw and seed:

1\. Gelatin coated  2  x  96 well  flasks/plates with sterile filtered 0, 1,
5, 10, 20 mg/mL  gelatin solution and then incubated all coated flasks at 37ºC

  * Time when all flasks placed into the incubator   16:40 a/pm 

2\. Aliquotted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then
placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath for a minimum of 20 minutes
prior to use:

  *  Growth media (for seeding):    16mL in  1 x Small Sample Container tubes 
  * Time that aliquot was placed in the water bath to warm before use:   16:50 a/pm

## Thaw and seed vial (2 vials were thawed for KK at the same time - details
below):

3\. Collected the cryovials from Liquid Nitrogen storage & place in foam
floater in water bath for 5 min  17:15 - 17:20 a/pm

Location where cryovial was collected from:

Vial details:  4   x  500K  cryovials at   500K  cells each for a total of
2000K  cells

Brew

Tower/Bucket #1  

Box/Cane #6  

Vial location:F4-F7

Vial ID(s):2909 2910 (SS) 2911 2912 (KK)  

`4. Ethanol sprayed & transferred the vial(s) to the BSC.`

`5.  Added  500µL of Growth Media (to generate a total volume of 1mL in the
cryovial) to the cryovial, resuspended the cell suspension gently to reduce
osmotic shock. `

`6. Collected 800uL (SS) 1mL (KK) of cell suspension (2909,2910 - SS) (2911,
2912 - KK) & transfer into the pre-warmed 26.88mL (KK) and 16mL (SS) tube of
Growth Media. `

`7. Using a 10mL serological pipette, resuspended & distributed the cells
evenly in the   26.88mL(KK) 16mL (SS) of pre-warmed Growth Media (prepared in
Step 2). `

`8. Transfered   140uL (KK - all wells) 100uL (SS - Columns B- 2nd last) to
each well.`

`9. Transfered flask/plate(s) to incubate at 18:07: `

  * [X]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (aviary cells)

  

Making labels

Note - You will need to increase the passage number by one. (i.e. if your
thawed vial ID has a passage number of 3, when you make a culture ID for you
vessel you will need change the passage number to 4 on Airtable.)
