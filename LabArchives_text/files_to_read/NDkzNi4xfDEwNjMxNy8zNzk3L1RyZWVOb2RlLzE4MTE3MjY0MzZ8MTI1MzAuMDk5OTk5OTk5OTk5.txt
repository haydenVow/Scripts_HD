The aim of this study is to pre-screen and test DaNaGreen scaffold to see
whether or not the scaffold will absorb the antibody stain during analysis
with ELISA.

In addition to this, other scaffolds will also be included in the ELISA
analysis. Although a separate study was done with these scaffolds, it is not
certain if a non tissue culture treated 96-wp was used, which would have a
drastically big impact on the results. Therefore a repeat should be preformed.
