Aim/Purpose


The aim of this study is to identify the types of lipids and proteins and dive
further into analysis on micronutrients (vitamins and minerals) and other
relevant compounds identified in prior research, in myoblast, myotube,
fibroblast and frozen tissue across relevant cell lines available at Vow.


Hypothesis


We will be able to obtain the cells masses required for different analysis and
be able to identify and analyse the different components (lipids, proteins,
myoglobin, B12) across fibroblast, myoblast, myotubes and frozen muscle tissue
in different cell lines.


Technical Gap


  * We are not certain on what the weight of the cells obtained from a certain number cells or cell factories is  
  * We have not differentiated cells in scale before using cell factories 
  * We have not performed a passage on differentiated cells before and therefore will not be certain on the results 
  * Apart from DOLLY12, we have not explored in depth the growth and doubling times of other cell lines, making it difficult to plan and estimate cell harvest amount
  * Many analysis methods that will be identified and used have not been performed by vowsers, therefore there will be a learning curve


Method/Procedure


The method section will be split into three key sections:

1\. Cell expansion

This section will focus on how cells will be expanded for use in analysis. It
will detail the timeline of the process and media/dry stock requirements

  

2\. Analysis methods

This section will focus on what studies/analysis methods we will be performing
to identify and measure specific compounds.

Summary of study progress: KR3 tracker

  

3\. Interpretation of data

This section will focus on how the studies will be analysed, including what we
are after in each analysis




##                          1\. Cell Expansion  




### Experimental plan

Test run with DOLLY12 MCB

Aim: to determine how much cell mass corresponds to cell number and flask
amount.

Day 1 (Mon): Thaw cells

Day 2 (Tues): Feed

Day 4 (Thurs): Passage

  * Seed lower - 1000 cells/cm2 
  * Record cell number, cell weight 
  * Seed assay for Cell troubleshooting

Day 6 (Sat): Feed

Day 8 (Mon): Passage

  * Record cell number + cell weight 

Day 10 (Wed): Feed

Day 11 (Thus): Passage

  

Experimental plan

First stage: Grow cells via expansion + extend for differentiated cells

  * Day 1 (Mon - Fri): Preparation on Reagents (Growth Media, PBS, Gelatine, Tryple) 
    * Calculate required reagents + dry stock for growth 
  * Day 2 (Tue):Thaw cells 
  * Day 3 (Wed): 100% Feed 
  * Day 5 (Fri): Passage
  * Day 7 (Sun): 50% Feed
  * Day 8 (Mon): Passage 
    * Start cell differentiation 
      * seed 4M into 4CF for differentiation (1 x 4CF or 2CF)
    * Seed cells for other assays 
      * Seed 2 x 24wp for Bradford or BCA
    * Freeze myoblast or continue expansion 
      * At this stage, cells may be ready for freezing into 3 x 1mg (1M cells) samples and 3 x 10mg (10M cells)
        * After obtaining cell pellet, wash with ice cold PBS and divide into correct sample weight 
        * Centrifuge sample and aspirate ice cold PBS 
        * Weight once more to obtain final reading 
        * Freeze samples in tubes at -80 freezer 
      * If the ideal cell mass cannot be obtained, continue with the cell expansion process. (See below)  

  * Day 10 (Wed): 50% Feed
  * Day 11 ( Thurs): Passage   
    * Myoblast: Harvest cells + perform cell count + weigh samples + split into desired sample amount (see above) + freeze at -80. 

  

Second stage - Differentiated cells: (dates may change depending on
confluency)

  * Day 1 : Make E6 media  

    * ~2.4 or 4.8L or 9.6L (depending on seeded vessel size and frequency of feed) 
  * Day 1: 100% Feed E6
    * Check confluency - 100% feed to E6 if 90% - 100% confluent
  * Day 3: 100% Feed E6 
  * Day 5: 100% Feed E6 
  * Day 7: 100% Feed E6 
  * Day 9 :Make E6 media 
    * 1.8L or 3.6L or 7.2L  (depending on seeded vessel size and frequency of feed) 
  * Day 9: 100% Feed E6 
  * Day 11: 100% Feed E6 
  * Day 13: 100% Feed E6 
  * Day 15: Harvest 
    * Requirement (dependant on vessel type) 
      * Tryple: ~400 mL
      * PBS: ~800mL 

  

Refer to cell expansion excel for reagent amount and cell number estimation.

### Experimental plan

Proteomics and lipidomic - Harvest cells and freeze down

Day 10 (Thurs): Obtain myoblast from harvest

  * estimate of 2 mg for proteomics and 12 mg for lipodomic studies
  * After centrifuging cells, remove tryple/PBS and resuspend in growth media. 
  * Measure weight of 1 x 50 mL tube
  * Combine cell pellets into one the 50 mL tube and centrifuge 
  * Remove growth media and resuspend/wash cells in ice cold PBS
  * Centrifuge and remove  PBS 
  * Weigh 50 mL tube with cells and record cell mass
  * Divide into 1g samples and freeze at -80 

Day 7 - Day 21 (Mon): Obtain differentiated cells from harvest and keep in
culture for up to 14 days in E6

##                 3\. Data interpretation  




Analysis aim:

  * Identify all the different proteins and lipids in the sample and compare data across myotubes, differentiated cells, fibroblast and muscle tissue as well as across other cell lines. This is done to determine key differences and identify interesting compounds that could give our product a competitive edge
