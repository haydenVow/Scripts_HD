Purpose of this experiment

It was critical to generate a fibroblast WCB in order for the large amount of
planned work around the co-culture project involving fibroblasts to go ahead.

115 million fibroblasts were banked for a DOLLY12_F WCB.

Cells were banked at 1 million cells per mL and 115 vials were banked
successfully. Three people were involved in the banking to ensure that the
process went as smoothly and swiftly as possible. In addition, these
fibroblasts were weighed at the request of production in anticipation of kick-
off of a project around generating fibroblast samples for tasting. 115 million
fibroblasts weighed 0.6g, for an approximate average of 0.5mg per million
fibroblasts. These fibroblasts had a morphology consistent with that of
fibroblasts, and do not appear to have substantially changed in appearance
since they stained were stained vimentin(+).

In addition, this was the first time that fibroblasts have been expanded to
the WCB stage. We have not taken fibroblasts past passage 3 before, and thus
it was good to see that the cells proliferated consistently and as expected
based on previous doubling times. In this instance, fibroblasts doubled 10.45
times over 11 days for an approximate doubling time of 25.26 hours. This meant
that cells reached near 100% confluency and required passaging after 3-4 days
of subculturing at 7k cells per cm2.

In closing, 115 million fibroblasts were banked down in vials of 1 million.
This experiment demonstrates DOLLY12 Fibroblasts are capable of reaching a
minimum of 8 passages without any noticeable slowing of doubling times.
