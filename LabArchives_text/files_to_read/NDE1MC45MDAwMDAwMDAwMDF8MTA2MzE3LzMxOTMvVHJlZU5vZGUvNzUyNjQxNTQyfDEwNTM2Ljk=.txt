Process:

  1. Aliquoted:
    1. 1.5 mL  of  each of the growth media conditions above   

    2. 15 mL of DMEM/F12 + 10% FBS + 1X P/S 
    3. 15 mL of GM + HDAC 1 (0.1ug/mL)  

    4. 15 mL of GM + HDAC 2 (0.1ug/mL)  
Placed in water bath:   11:40  

  2. Removed 6-well plates from shaker and left in incubator for 5 minutes
  3. Took micrographs of each well in each 6-well plate
  4. Collected culture vessels from shakers, wiped with ethanol-sprayed cloth and brought into BSC (if necessary, paused shakers by pressing the "play" button on the controller on the side wall of the incubator)
  5. Using a p1000 for the 6-well plate cultures and a 5 mL serelogical pipette for the E125 flasks, gently pipette-mixed cultures for ~1 minute to break up cell clumps
  6. Pipetted suspensions though 70 um cell strainer into 8 x 15 mL tubes  and 3 x 50 mL flasks (keep E125 flask and 6-well plates in BSC as cultures will be returned to these post centrifugation) 
  7. Centrifuged at 300 x g for 5 min. Timestamp: 12:35 - 12:40     

  8. Aspirated supernatants, taking care to not disrupt or aspirate pellet
  9. Replaced fresh, warmed media in all cultures 
  10. Gently pipette-mixed cultures again before moving back to E125 flask and 2 x 6-well plates 
  11. Returned vessels to incubator and replaced in clamp. If shaker was paused, remembered to press play to restart shaking. 6-well plates should be shaking at 150 RPM and E125 at 120 RPM) Timestamp:  13:20

### Observations/Summary:

 75% media changed on vessel(s)

  1. 7502-F_DOLLY12-Sheep P8-1of2
  2. 7503-F_DOLLY12-Sheep P8-2of2

 50% media changed on vessel(s)

  1. 7504-F_DOLLY12-Sheep P8-1of3
  2. 7505-F_DOLLY12-Sheep P8-2of3
  3. 7506-F_DOLLY12-Sheep P8-3of3

Total volume in each well of the 6-well plates was ~2 mL (rather than 3 mL,
which is what they started at), indicating significant evaporation. A 1.5 mL
medium change is 75% of 2 mL. Therfore, when planning future experiments, make
enough medium to perform 100% medium changes at every feed (to make sure that
the evaporation is replaced).
