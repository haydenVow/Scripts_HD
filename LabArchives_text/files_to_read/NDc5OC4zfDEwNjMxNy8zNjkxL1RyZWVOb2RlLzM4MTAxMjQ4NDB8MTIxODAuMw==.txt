Process:

1\. Aliquotted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then
placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath for a minimum of 20 minutes
prior to use:

  1.  Growth media (for seeding):    30mL in   1 tubes
  2.  Time that all aliquot was placed in the water bath to warm before use:   14:19 a/pm 

2\. Collected the cryovial from Liquid Nitrogen storage & place in foam
floater in water bath for 5 min  14:32 - 14:37 a/pm

Location where cryovial was collected from:

 Homer  

Tower/Bucket # 2

Box/Cane #2

Vial location: C2

Vial ID(s): 2299-Culture-6303-Vial-20of115




3\. Ethanol sprayed & transferred the vial(s) to the BSC.

4\. Added  500µL of Growth Media (to generate a total volume of 1mL in the
cryovial) to the cryovial, resuspended the cell suspension gently to reduce
osmotic shock.  
5.Collected 20ul aliquot to perform cell count 13:40

6\. Collected the entire 1mL of cell suspension & transfer into the pre-warmed
tube of Growth Media (prepared in Step 2).




6\. Using a 10mL serological pipette, resuspended & distributed the cells
evenly in the  30 mL of pre-warmed Growth Media (prepared in Step 2).

7\. Seeded cells into 1 x T175 flasks.  

8\. Transfered   30mL to each   1 flask/well.

9\. Transfered flask/plate(s) to incubate at: 14:40

  * [x ]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells).

10\. Performed trypan blue cell count on cells retained earlier. See cell
count spreadsheet here:
