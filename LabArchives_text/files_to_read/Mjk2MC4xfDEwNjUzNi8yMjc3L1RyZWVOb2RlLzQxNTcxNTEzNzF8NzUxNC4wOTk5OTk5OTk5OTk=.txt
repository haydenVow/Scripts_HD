Procedure

Taking a Sample from the STR200/2000

  

  1. Locate the sample line.
    1. The sample line is roughly 30cm in length and is the first silicone tube in the right hand side viewing window and has a blue cap.
    2. The sample line is on the right hand side viewing window for both the 200L and 2000L STR.
  2. Ensure that the line is clamped before commencing any operations.
  3. Observe the sample line for any cell clumps or aggregates.
    1. If there are any present squeeze the tubing to break up the clumps to ensure they are removed with the first draw.
  4. Remove the luer lock cap from the sample line.
    1. Note - Be very careful not to twist off the lure lock connection from the tubing. Hold the lure connector not the tube while twisting the cap off
  5. Spray 70% ethanol on the luer lock ending of the sample line.
  6. Attach a 30 mL syringe to the luer lock on the sample line and twist to secure both components. Continue twisting to finger tightness.
  7. Apply a small amount of force to the syringe to create a small vacuum.
  8. Release the clamp on the sample line and draw a sufficient volume of growth medium, ~30 mL.
  9. Re-clamp the sample line.
  10. Discard the first draw sample, as the cells can concentrate in the sample line forming clumps which can skew the results of a cell count.
  11. Repeat steps 8-11 for the second and third draws which can be used for any downstream analysis (i.e., cell count, pH testing or dissolved oxygen testing).
  12. Re-apply the clamp. Failure to do so will result in a build-up of pressure in the sample line potentially causing failure of the luer lock and compromising the sterility of the 200L bag.
  13. Untwist the syringe from the sample line luer lock.
  14. Spray 70% ethanol on the luer lock ending of the sample line.
  15. Re-apply the luer lock cap to the sample line ending.

Taking an Offline pH Reading:

Calibration of pH Probe:

* Calibrate the probe at least once a week

  1. Remove the cap from the pH probe.
  2. Rinse the probe with water and very gently dry the outside of the probe surfaces with a lint-free wipe.
  3. Press the 'Cal' button to enter calibration mode.
  4. Clear the previous calibration settings
  5. One by one calibrate the probe to pH 4.01, 7.01 and 10.01 standards
    1. You will know the probe is finished calibration each sample when you hear a beep. Once you hear the beep, clean the probe and click 'Next' to calibrate the next sample

* For storage/after use store the probe in 3M KCl solution OR the 7pH buffer solution. DO NOT leave the probe dry. 

Measuring the pH:

  1. Using the cleaned and calibrated probe, immerse the pH probe into the solution.
  2. Leave the probe in the solution until the probe beeps, take the reading as this time as your final reading. 
  3. Record reading in the required location.
  4. Rinse the probe with water after use and place the cap back on

## pH calibration for Optical Patch Probes

  1. Select device "AI144".
  2. Select the "Cali" tab from the set of tabs available.
  3. Select the value box for "CSP1".
  4. Input the reading that "AI144" is displaying from the "pH/pO2 Signals" device dialog into the "New value" field.
  5. Select "OK".
  6. Select the value box for "REF1".
  7. Input the reading obtained by the offline pH probe measurement into the "New value" field.
  8. Select "OK".
  9. Select "Calibrate"
  10. Select "Yes" to "Calibration passed for BR001_AI144'
  11. Select "No" to printing out a calibration protocol.
  12. Observe the reading for "AI144" to ensure it has changed its reading to the reference value measurement.
