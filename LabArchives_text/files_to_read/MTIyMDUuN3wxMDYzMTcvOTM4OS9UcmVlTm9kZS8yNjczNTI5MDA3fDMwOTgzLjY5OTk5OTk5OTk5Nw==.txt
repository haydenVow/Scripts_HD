Imaged clone B/F8 under 10x objective phase microscopy. The cells appeared
very large and flat with jagged edges. There was lots of cell debris floating
around the culture.  Confluence had hardly increased since imaging done on the
9/8/22. The population is likely largely senescent. As a result this colony
was discarded to focus on clones still growing in the three other experiments,
EPIC31224, EPIC31347 and EPIC31348. This marks the final clone discarded from
this experiment (see culture tracking history for clones here

Therefore this experiment has concluded.
