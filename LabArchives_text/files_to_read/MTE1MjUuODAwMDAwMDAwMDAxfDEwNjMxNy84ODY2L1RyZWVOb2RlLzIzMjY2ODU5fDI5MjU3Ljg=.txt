Experimental Plan


Tissues for both experiments 4 and 5 have been matured for 10 days. Tissue
formation looks good from a qualitative assessment of tissue structure and
integrity. Tissues will now be characterised using a variety of methods which
are outlined here. Given the small amount of tissue (2 replicates per cell
density), we will be maximising the amount of analyses that we can perform on
the tissue.

Briefly, all 12 tissues cultured for experiment 4 will be separated for 3
types of tissue preparation: Tissue digestion, Snap-freezing and Fixation.

Tissue Harvest

  1. Cut tissues with a scalpel or fine scissors at the "cut point" and remove from the mould with forceps
  2. Wash samples once in PBS
  3. Gently blot tissues dry with sterile gauze (without damaging tissue)
  4. Weigh tissue on weighing paper and record the weight below
  5. In a clean petri dish, cut tissues as per figure 1 above
  6. Place samples into PBS for further prep

TISSUE SAMPLEWEIGHT (mg)Observations  
1-15M-a172.5holds together well -  
2-15M-b300.3holds together well - bit of structure  
3-20M-a373.5very similar to the 25M structures but more elastic/stringy -
holds structure much better  
4-20M-b268.3fell apart - did not cut sample, only used for viability testing  
5-20M-c176.5very similar to the 25M structures but more elastic/stringy  
6-25M-a285.6Appears to hold its structure better -  some defining features -
able to see the area where it attaches to the poll. Still rather soft.  Came
out easier  
7-25M-b216.1Very stringy, not too fragile as it holds together while being
handles. 'Cheese-like' Yellow colouring with some pink throughout .  
8-25M-c91.1Appears to slightly harder to cut compared to 25M-b. Stringy and
soft aswell, but holds together.  
9-40M-a203.2Appears to hold its structure better -  some defining features -
able to see the area where it attaches to the poll. Still rather soft.  Came
out easier  
10-40M-b272same as above  
11-60M-a414Very slimy, did not hold much structure when removed. Balls up into
a singular blob. When moving, it is slightly stretchy and Snot like.  
the exterior is firmer than the interior - feels like a film.  
12-60M-b255.8same as above  
  
Notes from all samples:

  * \- colour similar to raw chicken breast 
  * \- the exterior is firmer than the interior - feels like a film.  
  * \- the tissue that wraps around the poll is a bit more sturdier than the middle which is a bit more fragile

  

  

Fixation (for Microscopy)

  1. Fix tissue in a 12 well plate in 4% PFA in PBS (Fixation buffer) overnight at 4degs
  2. Following day, wash 3x5mins in PBS Start time: 10:33 12/07/22 
  3. Store tissue in PBS + 0.02% Sodium Azide in 4 degs

Fixed tissue will be taken to UNSW in 70% Ethanol for tissue processing,
paraffin embedding, sectioning and some slides (every other?) will be used for
H&E staining and subsequent slide-scanning.

Snap Freezing (for Molecular Analyses)

  1. Tissue segment for snap-freezing will be further cut into 2 or 3 pieces (depending on handling ease)
  2. Each portion will be placed into an Eppendorf tube
  3. Snap-freeze Eppendorf tubes in liquid nitrogen for 3-5 seconds each
  4. Place in the -80 freezer

Snap frozen tissues will be used for proteomic analysis and possibly other
molecular analyses at a later date (when we have built up a larger number of
samples)

Digestion (for Flow Cytometry)

  1. Remove the tissue portion from PBS and place onto a clean petri dish
  2. Add a few drops of digestion buffer onto the tissue
  3.  ~~With scalpel, mince up tissue into small pieces (almost paste-like) -  ~~samples did not cut, therefor used the black of a test tube and petri dish to smear the samples to create a paste. 
  4. Place minced tissue into a specimen pot with 20ml digestion buffer
  5. Incubate with agitation for 10 mins 15:22-15:32 
    1. Room temperature
    2. 60rpm on a Thermo Fischer shaking plate.
  6. Place 70um cell strainer into 50ml falcon and wet the strainer with digestion buffer
  7. Pipette minced tissue into the cell strainer and ensure that all tissue has passed through, and a single cell suspension is formed
  8. Centrifuge at 500g for 5 minutes
  9. Wash pellet with PBS.
  10. Resuspend pellet in ~~10ml  ~~5mL fixation buffer and incubate for 10 mins at RT and place into 15ml falcon
  11. Centrifuge at 500g for 5 minutes.
  12. Wash (resuspend) cells once in 5ml permeabilisation buffer
  13. Centrifuge at 500g for 5 minutes.
  14. Resuspend cells in 10mL of PBS in a new 15mL tube. 
  15. Centrifuge at 500g for 5 minutes.
  16. Resuspend cells in ~~  ~100-200uL~~ 500uL of PBS
  17. Count cells from two tubes (for an approximate count across tubes) using Haemocytometer
    1. Density tube #40M-B : 1.5M/mL
  18. Resuspended "larger" pellets in 1mL total, smaller pellets remained in 500uL
  19. Wet FACS tube filter with 1/2 drops PBS
  20. Place pipette tip flush with filter and pipette quickly into FACS tubes
  21. Pause point in protocol - place samples in fridge. 

Labelling cells with ~~  DAPI and PI will be done the following day (Tuesday
12th July) ~~ Annexin V and PI on 20 July for flow cytometry


Flow Cytometry used to perform Live-Dead Investigation of the Samples


Date performed: 20/08/22

Performed by: Alex W, Varshana B

Samples were stained using the FITC Annexin V Apoptosis Detection Kit with PI
(stk 7041) (Cat 640914, lot B354327, 100 tests) and were analysed using the
FACSMelody

Protocol

  1. Transfer 100 µL of each sample cell suspension in a 1.5 mL eppendorf
  2. Add 5 µL of FITC Annexin V
  3. Add 10 µL of Propidium Iodide Solution. 
  4. Gently vortex the cells and incubate for 15 min at room temperature (25°C) in the dark. 13:21
  5. Add 400 µL of Annexin V Binding Buffer to each tube.
  6. Wet FACS tube filter with 1/2 drops FACS buffer
  7. Place pipette tip flush with filter and pipette quickly into FACS tubes
  8. Perform flow cytometry on all samples
    * Each control was recorded for 10,000 events. 
    * Each condition was recorded for 20,000 events.

Results obtained from samples do not align with results of the control samples
(in 1:10 and 1:100 H2O2), whereby we can not ascertain clear unstained/live
cells populations from the apoptotic and dead cell populations you would
expect from an assay that uses Annexin V and PI.

Moving Forward: We we conduct an optimisation experiment to improve the assay
prior to the Harvest of tissue disc experiment D.
