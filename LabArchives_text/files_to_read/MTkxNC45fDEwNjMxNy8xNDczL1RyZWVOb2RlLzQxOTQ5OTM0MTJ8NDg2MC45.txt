Media Changes and outlet tubing config

Operator: JB

Preparation:

  1. No autoclaving necessary. All work completed outside the BSC.
  2.  1000 mL schott bottle filled with tap water. Red dye added to simulate media.
  3. A second schott bottle was used for media waste
  4. Inlet and outlet steel tubing were inserted into the Bioreactor (WASHe) through drilled and grommet-equipped holes in the reactor lid
  5.  Pump set to 140 RPM. Max speed is 200 RPM.  
  

Test parameters:

  1.  Simultaneous waste removal and fresh media addition (exchange media 50% by simultaneously pumping in and out of reactor. 
  2. Subsequent operations (remove 50% media from reactor, then add 50% fresh media)
  3.  Straight vs bent fresh media outlet tubing and it`s effect on mixing

Notes:

For test 1, samples of the "fresh media" (with dye at starting conc.), reactor
pre-media change (water), reactor post-media change (mix of water and dye) as
well as the waste reservoir were taken and read on an absorbance reader.

  1. A calibration curve was prepared by serial dilution of the pure starting material (from fresh media bottle) = highest conc.
  2. In a deepwell plate, 1 mL of water was added to well A2-8
  3. well A1 was filled with 1 mL of starting conc. dye
  4. to well A2, 1 mL of starting conc. dye was added for a 1-1 dilution. the sample was pipette-mixed, avoiding bubble formation
  5. 1 mL of A2 was transferred into well A3 using a fresh tip, resulting in a 1-4 dilution of the original dye solution.
  6. this process was continued until well A7, where after mixing 1 mL was removed to waste
  7. well A8 was used as a diluent control (blank)
  8. A non-TC treated 96w plate was prepared with replicates of the calibration curve by 3x transferring 200uL of DPW well A1-8 using a multichannel pipette into Columns 1-3 of the 96w plate with row A containing the highest dye conc.
  9. The 3 samples (reactor pre-run, post-run and waste bottle) were pipetted 5x into suitable wells on the 96w plate and measure on an absorbance reader at 595 nm. These sample had to be rerun in 8x pre-dilution due to absorbance reads being saturated initially.
  10.  A calibration curve was established and the final sample concentrations for each sample calculated.

Observations:

  1.  Simultaneous operations result in excessive "fresh media loss" due to the newly added liquid being pumped out into waste halfway through the media exchange (see videos and data below)
  2. no dye was observed in the waste bottle if sequential operation was employed
  3. bent outlet tubing resulted in better mixing of fresh media into the bioreactor volume as shown in the videos below. However, mixing of fresh added media can also be achieved by other means, e.g. stirring the reactor volume or recirculating
  4. The volume exchanged was timed at a given pump flowrate, estimated to be 500 ml/min
