Equipment and reagent for Gluten prep:

  * 100g gluten
  * 100 mL water 
  * Additional water for heating 
  * Additional water for filling specimen jar 
  * Scalpel 
  * 3 x 500 - 1L beaker
  * Stirrer 
  * Tweezer 
  * 27 x Specimen jars 
  * large bowl 
  * scales 
  * measuring cylinder 
  * sieve or colander 
  * 100 mm culture plate

  

Method to prepare samples:

  1. In a large bowl, combine gluten and water and knead 10 - 15 minutes until a smooth ball forms (it should spring back when you poke it )
  2. Allow seitan to rest for 1 hour 
  3. Prepare sample for sterilisation and heat treatment: 

  

Condition one: Heat in water at 80 degrees + autoclave

  1. Fill beakers half way with water (500 mL) and heat at least 6 samples at 80 degrees for 100 minutes - 16:20 - 18:00pm
  2. Remove samples at given timepoints with a tweezer and transfer onto a 6 well plate
  3.  Allow to cool  (20 minutes), before cutting into desired size for autoclaving
