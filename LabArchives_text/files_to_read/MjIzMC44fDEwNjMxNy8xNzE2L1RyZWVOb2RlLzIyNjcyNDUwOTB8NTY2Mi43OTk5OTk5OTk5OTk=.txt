Background

  

Process:

  1. Secured cross hatched white CO2 line coming from incubator with thin blue tubing by attaching zip ties.  

  2. Cut two 8cm thin silicon tubing and attached 0.22uM PTFE filter to one piece.
  3. Attached blue gas line (CO2 + air) to bigger, clear silicon tubing which was then linked to 0.22uM filter inlet.
  4. 0.22uM filter outlet was attached to a clear adapter from bioreacter parts drawer where the second 8cm silicon tubing was attached.
  5. Outlet of second 8cm silicon tubing was attached to metal adapter which feeds into culture volume via a third piece of clear silicon tubing (12cm approx).
  6. CO2 and gas flow meters were turned on and bubbling of gas was observed in 1.5L Milli-Q water in Wash-E vessel.
