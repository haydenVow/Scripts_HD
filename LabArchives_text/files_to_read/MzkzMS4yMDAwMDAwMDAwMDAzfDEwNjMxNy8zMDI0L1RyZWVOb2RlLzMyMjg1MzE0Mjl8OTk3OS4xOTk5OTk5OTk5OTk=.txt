Process:

  1. Collected 120 mL pot and 15 mL tube from fridge and placed in water bath:  11 :30     

  2. Collected culture vessels from shakers, wiped with ethanol-sprayed cloth and brought into BSC (if necessary, paused shakers by pressing the "play" button on the controller on the side wall of the incubator)
  3. Using a 5 mL serelogical pipette, gently pipette-mixed cultures for ~1 minute to break up cell clumps
  4. Pipetted suspensions though 70 um cell strainer into 2 x 50 mL tubes (keep E125 flask and spin tube in BSC as cultures will be returned to these post centrifugation) 
  5. Centrifuged at 300 x g for 5 min. Timestamp: 12:45 - 12:50     

  6. Aspirated supernatants, taking care to not disrupt or aspirate pellet
  7. Re-suspended culture 7342 in 25 mL of growth media. Re-suspended culture 7415 in 10 mL of growth media.
  8. Gently pipette-mixed cultures again before moving back to 1 x E125 flask and 1 x spin tube
  9. Returned vessels to incubator. If shaker was paused, remembered to press play to restart shaking. Spin tubes should be shaking at 206 RPM and E125 at 130 RPM. Timestamp:  13:03
