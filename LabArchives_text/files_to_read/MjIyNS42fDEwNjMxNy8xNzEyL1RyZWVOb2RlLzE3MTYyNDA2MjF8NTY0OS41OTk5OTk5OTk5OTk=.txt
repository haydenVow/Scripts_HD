Growth Media:

  * DMEM/F12 + 20% FBS + 1X P/S
  * DMEM/F12 + 20% FBS + 1X P/S + 10uM ROCK inhibitor Y-27635
  * DMEM/F12 + 20% FBS + 1X P/S + 10uM ROCK inhibitor Y-27635 + 1:100 Anti-clumping agent
  * DMEM/F12 + 20% FBS + 1X P/S + 0.1% w/v Pluronic F-68 (Poloxamer 188)




### Process:

1\. Took image of vessel with microscope on phase setting.

3\. Aliquotted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then
placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath for a minimum of 20 minutes
prior to use:

  1. TrypLE:      250   mL in     1    tubes
  2.  dPBS (for washing and neutralising):     250    mL in   1     tubes
  3. Growth media (for pellet resuspension):     20    mL in     1    tubes
  4. Growth media (for seeding):     10    mL of each growth media in   1 tubes
  5. Growth media (for seeding 100mm plates):     80    mL in   1 tubes placed in incbuator at  15:40 pm   

Time that all aliquots were placed in the water bath the warm before use
14:40 pm

Note: if aliquots were placed in water bath at different time, record the time
stamp for each individual solution.




4\. Removed vessel(s) from the incubator     14:55  

5\. Washed the vessel(s) with dPBS (warmed).

6\. Added     250    mL tryple to each vessel/well and incubated at 37˚C.

  1. Start/Finish for TrypLE was     14:58-15:18   

7\. Neutralised with     250     dPBS and combined cell suspension into a
500ul  tub.

8\. Centrifuged at 650 x g for 5 min.

  1. Start/Finish time for centrifugation was     15:50-16:55   




9\. Aspirated the supernatant(s).

10\. Resuspended pellet(s) in      23.8   mL    Growth   media    15:57 pm

11\. Aliquoted     70ul   of resuspended cells into a microcentrifuge tube for
cell count.

12\. Performed a cell count using the haemocytometer and recorded the cell
count data in the Google Doc spreadsheet called 'Cell Count Spreadsheet' (see
link below):

SSIBtIylyrBQE5kRX5Z8NtI/edit#gid=0

  1.  Total cell number was:     202M        

  2. Volume of cell suspension required for subculture was:   4x tubes with  8mL per Shaker tube (8.5M) + 1x tube with 4mL (34M)    for shaker experiment  

  3. Volume of cell suspension required for subculture was:    155uL cells into 80mL growth media slit across 8x 100mm dishes with (165,000/dish)  Cell sheet experiment Lab book https://au-mynotebook.labarchives.com/share/Vow%2520-%2520Team%2520Science/MTg4Ny42MDAwMDAwMDAwMDAxfDEwNjMxNy8xNDUyLTkzOTUvVHJlZU5vZGUvMzY3MjU5NzczNnw0NzkxLjU5OTk5OTk5OTk5OQ==  

  

Seeding Day:  
For suspension experiment

  1. Aliquot 8.5M cells into 4 x 50mL shake tubes, and 34M cells into 1 x 50mL shake tube.
  2. Centrifuge at 5x tubes 650 x g for 5 min at RT.
  3. Aspirate supernatant carefully
  4. Resuspend each pellet in 1mL of the respective Growth Media with a P1000 to break up the cells
  5. Add the remaining 9mL of respective Growth Media with a 10mL serological pipette to disperse cells evenly throughout the suspension
  6. Transfer tubes to shake at 206 RPM at 37ºC, 5% CO2. 16:50

For cell sheet experiment  

1\. Aliquot 155ul cell suspension into 80mL of growth media (DMEM/F12 +20% FBS
+1x p/s).  
2\. Transfer 10mL of the 80mL cell suspension to each of 8x 100mm petri
dishes.  
3\. Move dishes to cell culture incubator at 37ºC, 5% CO2 16:50
