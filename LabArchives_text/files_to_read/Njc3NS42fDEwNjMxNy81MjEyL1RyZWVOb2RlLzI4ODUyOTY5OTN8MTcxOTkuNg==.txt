Process:

Bradford:

  1. Added 12 drops of Hoescht 33342 to 24mL of Milli-Q water.
  2. Removed media supernatant from both 24 well plates and added 500uL of Hoescht/Milli-Q water mix.
  3. Performed serial dilutions of BSA stock till all concentrations [2000,1500,1000,750.500,250,125,25,12.5,6.75,0 mg/ml]
  4. Incubated in the dark at RT for 15 mins [ 11:48 - 12:03  a/pm]
  5. Imaged relevant rows on Zaber for cell normalisation.
  6. Performed freeze-thaw lysis protocol on each 24 well plate [ 17:38 - 17:46 a/pm, 17:49 - 17:59 a/pm, 18:00 - 18:11 a/pm]
  7. Centrifuged tubes for 5 mins at 1000g using micro-centrifuge.
  8. Tested volumes of C2C12 and DOLLY supertnatant against 250uL of Bradford reagent until grey/brown colour is achieved.
  9. Eventual ratio determined was 200uL of Bradford reagent with 20uL of sample.
  10. Construct a standard curve with BSA solution (2mg/mL) using the determined ratio from the previous step in triplicate.
  11. Added 20uL of each DOLLY12 and C2C12 sample to 200uL of Bradford reagent in triplicate
  12. Centrifuged all four plates for 3 mins at 300g.
  13. Read absorbance at 595nm.
