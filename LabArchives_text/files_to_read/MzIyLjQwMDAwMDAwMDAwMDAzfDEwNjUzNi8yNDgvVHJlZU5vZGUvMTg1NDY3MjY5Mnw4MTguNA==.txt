6x10CS/CF Harvest (P5) & E-Flask Seed & Roller Bottle Seed


Experiment Plan:




Procedure - Harvest 10CS/CF

### Cell Harvest

  1. Turn on water bath and set temperature to 37C.
  2. Take the flasks for harvest and observe under the microscope at 4x objective for even cell distribution . Refer to VSOP-006. Take 2-3 images per flask.
  3. Aliquot required volume of dPBS (37C), dPBS (ambient temp) and TrypLE in separate sterile pots.  Refer to Table below for required volume.
  4. Place aliquots in pre-warmed water bath and leave for ~20 minutes or until warmed. Note: Ensure TrypLE is thoroughly warmed.
  5. Transfer aliquots and flasks required for harvest into the BSC.
  6. Collect growth media and loose aggregates from each flask.
  7. Wash with warmed dPBS, then collect this also.
  8. Add TrypLE to each of the flasks. Mix thoroughly to ensure coverage of the surface area.
  9. Place in the incubator at 37C. After 10 minutes, remove flasks and observe for 95-100% dissociation of cells. Incubate further until maximum dissociation level is reached.  
     NOTE: The flasks must be removed from the incubator within 18 minutes of initial incubation of TrypLE containing flasks
  10. Aspirate the TrypLE solution and collect into 250mL centrifuge tubes.
  11. Add ambient temperature dPBS to each flask as a final wash. To effectively remove remaining cells adhered to the flasks, mix thoroughly and then pour the dPBS into 250mL centrifuge tubes.
  12. Centrifuge at 700 x g for 5 minutes.````
  13. Meanwhile remove aggregates from collected growth media and dPBS via carefully aspiration with a serological pipette and place them into a 250mL centrifuge tube.
  14. Centrifuge this also at 700 x g for 5 minutes.
  15. Gently remove centrifuge tubes from the machine, ensuring not to disturb the cell pellets. Aspirate as much supernatant as possible from the tubes. Discard supernatant. Remove as much remaining supernatant with a 1mL pipette.

### Cell Count

  1. Following cell harvest and centrifugation, re-suspend the cell pellets. Use the table below to provide a rough estimation of the resuspension volume required.
  2. Perform cell count (Refer to VSOP-007) and enter details into Prodction Cell Count Calculator: VBLT001

### Re-pellet and Weigh Final Yield

  1. Label and Record the weight of 1 sterile centrifuge tube and set aside. Record details in Widget.  
  2. Add growth media to each centrifuge tube and resuspend cells. Refer to the table below for the required amount of growth media to be added.
  3. Combine all resuspended cells into the weighed centrifuge tube. 
  4. Wash all empty centrifuge tubes with growth media and add this to the centrifuge tube containing the resuspended cells. 
  5. Centrifuge at 700 x g x 5 minutes. 
  6. Aspirate the supernatant from the tube. Remove as much remaining supernatant with a 1mL pipette.
  7. Record the final weight of the cell pellet. Enter details in Widget. 
  8. Following this resuspend the cells in media ready to be seeded into E125 flasks and Roller Bottles.

Procedure - Seeding Roller Bottles

  1. Set the roller bottle apparatus to a speed of 0.5rpm (recommended 0.5-1.0rpm from corning, or 0.1-0.4rpm if cell attachment is bad)
  2. Gently unwrap packaging of the roller bottles to prevent static buildup.
  3. Spray a disposable wipe with 70%EtOH and wipe the exterior of the roller bottle and transfer into the BSC.
  4. Dispense 200mL media containing cells into the flask.
  5. Replace cap and twist to close, and then make a half cap turn to untwist to allow for gas exchange.
  6. Immediately place the roller bottle onto the roller bottle apparatus in the incubator at 37C, 5%CO2.
  7. Repeat Step 2-5 for the remaining bottles.

* Note: For Bottle (C, Seed with VitC) add 100uL of VitC (50ug/mL) stock solution to the 200mL cell containing media before dispensing it into the Roller Bottle.




Procedure - Seeding & Treatment of E-Flasks (E125)

  1. Turn on the water bath and set to 37'C.
  2. Aliquot required growth media into a sterile container/s and add:                                                                                                                                         \- VitC (50ug/mL) for flasks in group (2)                                                                                                                                                     \- VitC (50ug/mL) + TGFb (10ng/mL) for flasks in group (3)
  3. Place in the water bath and heat for at least 20 minutes.
  4. Transfer the treated media back into the BSC and add the desired concentration of cells to each aliquot
  5. Transfer flasks to the BSC and seed them with the cell-containing, treated media.
  6. Return the flask/s to the incubator at 37'C, 5% CO2.

Supernatant from cell pellet was very cloudy, so was divided into 50mL tubes
and spun again at 750g for 5 mins. Cell pellet in large 250 ml tube was very
soft and there was still some cell suspension liquid on top that was very
cloudy (this was left on top of the pellet).

Supernatant from re-spun 50mL tubes were still slightly cloudy but more clear
than previously. Small pellets formed in each tube. Superntant was removed,
and pellets resuspended in a 1mL of fresh media and added to the large cell
pellet in the 250mL tube. The 250mL tube was then pulse spun for a few seconds
and removed as much superntant as possible before weighed.

After pulse spin the supernatant was still very cloudy. We measured 7mL of
cell suspension and weighted the entire tube. This was 17.6246 g. (with 7mL of
media estimated, cell pellet weight alone is estimated at 10.6246g)


E-Flask Seeding (3xE125)


After seeding all roller bottles (1.2mL) and E-flasks (21.9mL) with volumes
calculated from VBLT Production Calculator Spreadsheet, there was 4mL
remaining of cell suspension, therefore an extra 400uL was added to each
E-flask.
