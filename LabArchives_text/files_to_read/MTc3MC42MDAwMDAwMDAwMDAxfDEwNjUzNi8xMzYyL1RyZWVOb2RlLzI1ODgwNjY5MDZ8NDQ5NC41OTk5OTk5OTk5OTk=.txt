Batch 34

  * 28/03/22 - 1x 10CS [ID:11215, group 3] was found contaminated with mould - incubated in the big Thermo. The lids were immediately parafilmed before moving and then disposed directly into a biohazard bag and brought outside. All other cultures in the the big Thermo were wiped with F10 and ethanol.
  * 04/04/22 \-  Contamination found in flask 1x10CS ID: 11237 (group 2) - bacterial - immediately disposed into clinical waste bag. 
  * 04/04/22 \- Batch 34 harvested (all using TrypLE). Flasks were split between library lab (8x10CS flasks) and main lab (15x10CS). Library lab flasks were observed for variation is peeling and then harvested all together in 1 tube (95g). Main lab flasks (all in 4 stack thermo incubators) were harvest into 3 different tubes depending on experimental group. Some aggregates in group 1 main lab harvest tube was put into group 2 and group 3 main lab harvest tubes to even the weight distribution of the tubes. 
  * 04/04/22 \- During clean up of Batch 34 harvest flasks, Varshana discovered black mould spots in the underside of one of the main lab flasks

  

  * 1g Samples from each harvest tube was extracted by LP on 06/04/22. Matthew co-ordinated delivery of samples to Belinda at Quantal on 07/04/22 for QC by enrichment
  * Belinda contacted LP with results showing all samples contaminated with fungi 13/04/22. ID requested for the 2 species grown. 




Batch 35

  * 08/04/22 \- Harvest of entire Batch 35. Batch moved to Main lab Thermo incubators during last phase of treatment (from 04/04/202)
  * 08/04/22 \- No visible signs of contamination in any flasks expect for 1x10CS which had fungal colonies throughout the flask and also black mould on the lid (#11346 contaminated in incubator 157)  

  * 08/04/22 \- Harvest of flasks separated by incubators, with those in incubator 157 harvested last. An aliquot of waste media from each incubator kept for internal QC incubation. 
  * 08/04/22 \- An aggregate from each tube was extracted and stored at 4'C over the weekend before sending for QC at Quantal (sent 11/04/12)




Batch 36

  * 06/04/22 - 1x5CS + 2x10CS (found in Thermo 82 and vios 134) contaminated with large mould colonies. Discarded immediately.  

  * 08/04/22 - #11506 in library lab binder has some questionable spots of the flask that looked like it could have been surface scratches on the flask. Decided to take an aliquot of the media for internal QC but continue with feed and incubation.
  * 11/04/22 - obvious cloudy contamination observed in flasks #11506 (however different from the initial mould found on the 06/04/22)
  * 11/04/22\- 20/30 flasks contaminated with what looked like bacterial contamination - same as that seen in #11506. Various degrees of contamination with some flasks very cloudy, and others with many white specks and others with only a few. An aliquot of some of the contaminated flask withvarying degrees on contamination and incubation from different incubators was taken to send to eurofins for ID (sent on the 12/04/22)
    * ID 11514 from Library Lab (very low level observation of white spots on small area of flask - media clear)
    * ID 11497 from Production Thermo (heavily contaminated with cloudy media)
    * ID 11517 from Production Vios (many white spots adhered to surface of the flask - media clear)
  * 13/04/22 - 3 out of 10 flasks showed signed of contamination and discarded (1 very cloudy, and 2 with lots of white spots). 
  * 15/04/22 \- 3 out of 7 flasks showed signs of contamination. Same morphology as previously seen in all others. Remaining 4 flasks quarantined in a vios incubator together. 
  * 19/04/22 \- 2 out of 4 of the remaining flasks showed signs of contamination. 
  * 19/04/22 \- All remaining flasks binned since entire batch 36 appears affected.
