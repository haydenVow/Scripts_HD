RELATED TO OKR:

## KR1: Develop a QMS-compliant serum-free media that supports 20+ doublings
of our chosen species in suspension  

### KR2: Characterise 2 x QMS-compliant suspension-adapted fibroblast clones
from our chosen species  

KR4: Establish and run a suspension pipeline at a rate of 10,000 clones per
month.

AIM/PURPOSE: Perform a minimal effort (no imaging or staining for 30 days)
suspension SCC run of CHOMP fibroblasts in 384 ULA plates.

HYPOTHESIS: CHOMP_09 fibroblasts sorted in 384 ULA wells will survive in
suspension such that we will attain â‰¥1 suspension adapted cell line.

RESULTS SUMMARY: See final report

CONCLUSIONS: Unable to assess aims and hypothesis of the study, due to
experiment being terminated prematurely due to contamination gate.

NEXT STEPS: At the time of writing this report, suspension cloning has since
been deprioritised as crucial for the launch of a first product, but continues
to be critical for Vow's long term strategy. No immediate next steps.
