  2. Wiped down the vial with 70% ethanol and transferred to BSC.
  3. Transferred  500 uL of washing to each vial to make total volume up to 1 mL. Pipette-mixed gently. 
  4. Transferred entire 1 mL from each vial and add to the remaining aliquot of washing medium.

  6. Transfer cell suspension containing 500,000 cells to 3 x separative 50 ml shaker tubes, and 2.5M cells to 15ml tube. (Note: we don't want to waste cells so if you have extra you can seed at a higher density) 
  7. Centrifuged the cells at 300 x g for 5 min at RT. 15:32 - 15:37
  8. Removed supernatant to remove residual DMSO from the cells. 
  9. Re-suspended the 500,000 cell pellets in 5 mL 3 of one of the pre-warmed medias. 
  10. Re-suspended the 2.5M cell pellet in the pre-warmed growth medium in the E125 flask. Transfer the cell suspension back to the shake flask. Incubate at 37ºC, 5% CO2 
  11. Set shaker to continuous shaking at 206 RPM for the 50ml flasks and 120RPM for the E125S
  12. Collected a 6th cryovial to seed remaining 2 x 50 mL shake tubes ~~~~1370-Culture-3905-Vial-17of32 ~~~~  

  13. Placed in waterbath 15:53 - 15:58
  14. Transferred  500 uL of washing to vial to make total volume up to 1 mL. Pipette-mixed gently. 
  15. Transferred entire 1 mL from vial and add to the remaining aliquot of washing medium
  16. Take 20 uL aliquot and perform cell count.https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1DPzKubYxfHmWogVPihC-SSIBtIylyrBQE5kRX5Z8NtI/edit#gid=0  
Total cell count 690,000

  17. Centrifuged the cells at 300 x g for 5 min at RT. 16:04 - 16:09
  18. Removed supernatant to remove residual DMSO from the cells. 
  19. Re-suspended the 500,000 cell pellets in 1 mL fresh medium (D/F+10%FBS+1xP/S)
  20. Collected a 7th cryovial to seed remaining 2 x 50 mL shake tubes
  21. Placed in waterbath 16:15 - 15:19
  22. Transferred  500 uL of washing to vial to make total volume up to 1 mL. Pipette-mixed gently.
  23. Transferred entire 1 mL from vial and add to remaining aliquot of washing medium. Combined with cell suspension from thawed vial #6.
  24. Take 20 uL aliquot and perform cell count.https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1DPzKubYxfHmWogVPihC-SSIBtIylyrBQE5kRX5Z8NtI/edit#gid=0  
Total cell count 854,000

  25. Centrifuged the cells at 300 x g for 5 min at RT. 16:21 - 16:26
  26. Removed supernatant to remove residual DMSO from the cells. 
  27. Ressuspended cells in remaining 2 x 5 mL aliquots of growth medium in shake tubes
  28. Incubate at 37ºC, 5% CO2 16:30
  29. RPMI & CD CHO NANDO got 430K cells each
  30. Making labels

Note - You will need to increase the passage number by one. (i.e. if your
thawed vial ID has a passage number of 3, when you make a culture ID for you
vessel you will need change the passage number to 4 on Airtable.)
