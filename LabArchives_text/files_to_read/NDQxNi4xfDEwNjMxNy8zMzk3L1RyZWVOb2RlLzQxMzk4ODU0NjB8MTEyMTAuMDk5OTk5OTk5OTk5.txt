RELATED TO MILESTONE:  KR2 - Generate â‰¥1 suspension-adapted fibroblast cell
line which is >95% viable and undergoes 10+ doublings

AIM/PURPOSE: To achieve adaptation of fibroblasts to suspension culture

HYPOTHESIS: Basal media supplemented with trace elements, vitamins and MEM
essential and non-essential amino acids will better support adaptation of
fibroblasts to suspension.

RESULTS SUMMARY: See here for results summary

No treatment condition was able to be adapted to suspension and all cultures
demonstrated significant decreases in viability throughout the 30-day
culturing period. RPMI and D/F12 cultures supplemented with additives (trace
elements, vitamins, MEM essential and non essential amino acids) continued to
survive until day 35.

CONCLUSIONS:

The results of this study were unsuccessful in adapting fibroblast cells to
suspension culture conditions, irrespective of the basal media utilised or the
inclusion of media additives. Despite these results, it appears the the
addition of trace elements, vitamins and MEM essential and non-essential amino
acids promoted survival of fibroblast whilst in suspension. Wherein, cultures
in these conditions routinely demonstrated the highest cell counts, and
continued to survive beyond the initial 30 day testing period. However there
was a lack of sufficiently clear data to support the hypothesis at this point
in time, predominantly due to the high level of variance observed between
replicates, making it difficult to determine of these additives can promote
fibroblast proliferation.

NEXT STEPS:

  * Investigate basal medium compositions lacking calcium and magnesium.   

  * Further exploration on the impact of trace elements, vitamins, and MEM essential and non-essential amino acid mixes on fibroblast survival in suspension. Both the D/F12 and RPMI conditions supplemented with additives consistently recorded the highest cell counts amongst all treatments evaluated.
