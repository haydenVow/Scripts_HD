Process:

  1. Collected E125 from shaker, wiped with ethanol-sprayed Rediwipe, and brought into BSC 
  2. Using a 25 mL serelogical pipette, gently pipette-mixed culture for 1 minute to break up cell clumps
  3. Pipette suspension into 1 x 50 mL tubes. Kept E125 vessels in BSC, as culture will be returned to this vessel after feed. 
  4. Centrifuged 50 mL tube at 300 x g for 5 min.  15:15 - 15:20
  5. Aspirated  100% (30 mL) of supernatant, taking extra care to not disrupt or aspirate pellet. 23 mL went into waste, and 7 mL went back into E-flask to achieve a 75% feed.
  6. Resuspended in 200 uL of medium
  7. Took 1 x 10 uL sample for haemocytometer cell count
    1. Cell count: 208,000
  8. Added  23 mL of fresh, warmed growth media
  9. Gently pipette-mixed cultures using serelogical, before moving cell suspension back to E125s
  10. Returned E125s to incubator. 16:00
