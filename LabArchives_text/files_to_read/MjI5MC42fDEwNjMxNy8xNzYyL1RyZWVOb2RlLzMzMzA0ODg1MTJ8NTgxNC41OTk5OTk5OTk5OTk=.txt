Stained and imaged cells adhered to microcarriers

  1. Removed culture(s) from the incubator and placed them in the BSC  `| 14:45 am/pm|`
  2. Swirled culture(s) by hand on the flat surface of the BSC for 5 seconds, the lid was quickly removed and 3x20uL samples of each suspension were taken while the liquid was still in motion. This ensures the carriers were evenly mixed at time of sampling.
  3. Transferred the aliquot(s) to separate wells on a 96 well plate and mixed each with 80uL of dPBS containing 1% w/v poloxomer 88 and 20uL/mL of Hoechst 33342. The plate used was the same as the plate used on Day 5 of stianing, ID ''7050-DOLLY12-Sheep P12-1of1'
    1. Wells in Columns 10-12 were used, a separate row was used for each original culture vessel.
    2. Row A: 6993
    3. Row B: 6992
    4. Row C: 6991
    5. Row D: 6990
    6. Row E: 6989
    7. Row F: 6988.
  4. Returned cultures to the incubator  `| 14:50 am/pm|`
  5. Left the 96 well plate to incubate at room temperature, in the dark (away from light), for 20 minutes.  `| 15:05-15:22 am/pm |`
  6. After incubation the wells were imaged on the Zaber in the main lab.
  7. 1 image at the centre of each well was captured under Phase and UV light magnification, same frame for both channels. 
    1. UVsettings: 100ms, 35 lamp intensity
    2. Phase settings: 3ms, 2.4 lamp intensity
  8. Once images were captured image pairs were selected for analysis using the 'uCarrier cell count' tool from MIA capture. [ :  ]
  9. Each image file was labelled with the suffix 7050-HTcarriersDay6. Replicate imaging file was subsequently labelled with the suffix '(2)' Files can be found on the Zaber Z drive or in the Vow P cloud account.  
  10. Discarded the plate after Imaging. [12:46] 

  




Growth Media:

  * [x]  DMEM/F12 + 20% FBS + 1X P/S + P38i (10uM)

Total media required: 45 + 15mL

Total p38i required: 30uL

  




Process Feeding:

1\. Aliquoted 45mL and 15mL of growth media into 1x50mL and 1x15mL tubes
respectively, placed at 37 degrees for 15 minutes    17:15 am

2\. Stopped the shakers in the top and bottom sanyo incubaotrs using
pause/stop button located on the pads stuck to the left side of the incubators
(the button to pause and start the shaker looks like a triangle and a square
separated by a backlash.

3\. Placed all vessels in the BSC and waited 2 minutes for the microcarriers
to settle to base of each vessel.

4\. Removed  50  % of supernatant from each vessel (15mL from E125s, 5mL from
50mL shake tubes).

3\. Replaced with fresh growth media (same volume as removed above for each
vessel).

4\. Returned vessel to incubate shaking at: 17:25am

  * [x]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (aviary cells)

\- Top sanyo incubator for E125 flasks shaking at 120 rpm, ensured the shaker
was turned on.

- Bottom sanyo incubator for 50mL shake tubes shaking at 250 rpm, ensured the shaker was turned on. 




### Observations/Summary:

### The samples taken from the spin tubes still appeared to have my 'streaked
out' Hoechst positive staining on most microcarriers. The Hoechst signals on
the microcarriers from the E flasks were again very uniform and circular.
Cells on carriers taken from the E125 flasks could be spotted under phase
microscopy while the microcarriers from the spin tubes appeared smooth. It is
possible most of the cells inside the 50mL tube have lysed and cell debris is
stuck to the carriers giving false positive staining after Hoechst 33342
addition.

### Results

  * Results were;
    * [ ]  As Usual (this is a repetitive task)
    * [x]  Unexpected because...
    * There could potentially be false positive signal on carriers from the 50mL tubes. 
    * [ ]  Need to be further analysed
    * [ ]  Other (.......)




Relevant Images/Figures (if applicable):

7050 https://mia-capture.vow.tools/#/session/recK3zkwBU6vILURB/images#group1,
See wednesday 9/6/20 images.

Phase and DAPI images of carriers from culture 6993  (E125 flask) cell
morphology appears much more spread out and is very visible on the carriers.

Phase and DAPI image of carriers from culture 6990 (50mL tube) cell morphology
is less visible, carriers very clean and cells present are very rounded.
