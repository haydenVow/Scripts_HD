(b) 9V Gelatin



(c) Laminin electrode control

Figure 1: Representative areas from full-well immunstained Zaber images
comparing the maturity of stimulated BUFFY6 cultures (top to bottom = Laminin
4V (a), Gelatin 9V (b), Laminin electrode control (c)). Cell nuclei were
stained using DAPI (blue), filamentous actin was stained using phalloidin
(green) and intracellular myosin heavy chain was stained using MF20 (red).




Figure 2: DAPI counts and normalised MF20 areas for the laminin-coated plate
(left) and the gelatin-coated plate (right). The graphs on the top row show
the number of viable cell nuclei after 10 days of electrical stimulation for
four different stimulation conditions (4V peak-to-peak, 9V peak-to-peak,
electrode control and a standard culture control) for each coated plate. The
graphs on the bottom row show the normalised MF20 areas for the same time
period and conditions. Error bars show standard error of mean, with N = 3 for
each data point.

Note: $ indicates a condition where the macro had issues accurately counting
DAPI-stained nuclei, with potential reasons elaborated in the Discussion
section of the report.
