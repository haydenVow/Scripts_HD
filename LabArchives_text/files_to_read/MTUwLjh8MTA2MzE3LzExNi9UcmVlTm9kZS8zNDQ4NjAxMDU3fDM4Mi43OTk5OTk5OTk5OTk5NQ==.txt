Growth Media:

  * [ ]  DMEM/F12 + 20% FBS + 1X P/S + P38i (10uM)

  

### Process:

2\. Removed 3x Gelatin coated    T175      vessels with sterile filtered 0.1%
gelatin solution from the fridge and then incubated all coated flasks at 37˚C.
These flasks were coated with gelatin 24 hours prior but were not used after
incubating for 1h at 37 degrees, they were refridgerated until now.

Gelatin coated 6 wells on 1x96 well plate and placed in the incubator for 1h
at 37 degrees  

  1. Time when all vessels(s) placed into the incubator       13:30   a/pm (T flasks)    13:45   a/pm (96 well plate).   

3\. Aliquotted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then
placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath for a minimum of 20 minutes
prior to use:

  1. TrypLE:     40    mL in    1x50mL     tubes
  2.  dPBS (for neutralising):     40    mL in    1x50mL    tubes
  3. Growth media (for pellet resuspension):     5    mL in     1x15    tubes
  4. Growth media (for seeding):     2x45mL + 1x1mL     in    2x50mL tubes and 1x15mL tubes respectivley    .   

Time that all aliquots were placed in the water bath the warm before use
13:52   a/pm

Note: if aliquots were placed in water bath at different time, record the time
stamp for each individual solution.

4\. Removed vessel(s) from the incubator     14:00   a/pm for imaging. Took
image of vessels with the primo microscope on phase setting, 4x objective.
Determined that the flasks were not confluent enough to ensure we would have
enough cells to seed an E125 flask with. Decided to expand the clones up from
4xT175 to 8xT175 flasks.

  1. Removed the growth media for seeding from the waterbath, combined them to a 250mL container and toppped up the container to 250mL using fresh growth media, returned the container to the waterbath to warm at 37 degrees [14:52] 
  2. Gelatin coated 5xT175 flasks and placed in the incubator    [14:56]

5\. Washed the vessel(s) with dPBS.

6\. Added     10    mL tryple to each vessel/well and incubated at 37˚C.

  1. Start/Finish for TrypLE was     15:11-15:21   a/pm 

7\. Neutralised with     10     dPBS (warmed) and combined cell suspension
into a    2x50mL     tubes.

8\. Centrifuged at 650 x g for 5 min.

  1. Start/Finish time for centrifugation was     15:32-15:37   a/pm 

9\. Aspirated the supernatant(s).

10\. Resuspended pellet(s) in     0.5    mL     growth     media, pellets were
then combined and the empty resuspension tube was washed with 1mL of growth
media before being combined with the cell pellet.     :   a/pm

11\. Aliquoted     10uL     of resuspended cells into a microcentrifuge tube
for cell count.

12\. Performed a cell count using the haemocytometer and recorded the cell
count data in the Google Doc spreadsheet called 'Cell Count Spreadsheet' (see
link below):

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1DPzKubYxfHmWogVPihC-
SSIBtIylyrBQE5kRX5Z8NtI/edit#gid=0&range=919:919

  1.  Total cell number was:       2,608,000     

  2. Volume of cell suspension required for subculture was:       all     

  3. Cell density per vessel:     326,000      

13\. Removed the pre-warmed      240     Growth media from the waterbath and
added 120uL of p38i. Transferred      2mL      of cell suspension to the
warmed growth media.  

14\. Transferred 30mL of cell suspension into each of the 8 pre-gelatin coated
T175      vessels after aliquoting and discarding excess gelatin.  

15\. Left at RT in the BSC for 30 min to allow cells to settle      16:26  \-
16:56 a/pm  

16\. Transferred vessel(s) to incubate at:

  * [ ]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells), incubator #68
  *

Observations/Summary:

  * Flasks only appeared 30% confluent upon inspection under the primovert microscope. We did not expect to have enough cells to start an E125 microcarrier culture. Instead it was decided to further expand the 4xT175 flasks into 8xT175s.
  * I suspect after consulting with Katie that the clone may be slowing down in growth. We will have to monitor the growth of these cells going forward to ensure their proliferation rate is not slowing down.

### Results:

  * Results were;
    * [ ]  As Usual (this is a repetitive task)
    * [ ]  Unexpected because...
      * Cell proliferation rate was slower than expected.

  1. Transferred vessel to incubate at:

  * [ ]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (aviary cells)

  

  1. Began the seeding schedule for 6 hours (below) using the KASA app.
    1. The minimum required agitation speed for shaken cultures to maintain the microcarriers in suspension can be estimated using this calculator: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/18NrC_xaJ2I87B4x3vTE46Z-ZUS3EV0Gw-CnM0DcukL4/edit?usp=sharing
      * Shake speed used =
    2. The seeding schedule may be reduced or extended by removing or adding 30 minute cycles as required. Generally, at least 3 but up to 12 hours are required to allow the maximum number of the inoculated cells to adhere.
