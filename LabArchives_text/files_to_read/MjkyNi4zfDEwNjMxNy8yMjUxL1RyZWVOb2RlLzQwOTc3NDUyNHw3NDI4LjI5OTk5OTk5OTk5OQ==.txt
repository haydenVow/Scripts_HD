1\. Prepared   3.5 mL  PBST (0.2% Triton-X)

2\. Prepared   3.5 mL  blocking buffer: PBST (0.1% Triton-X + PBS) + 3% bovine
serum albumin (BSA). (Kept in the fridge until needed in blocking step)

3\. Prepared Primary Antibody Mix: :  1.3 µL   Ki67   (1:1000) +   1.3 mL
Blocking Buffer

Pipette-mixed antibody mix and stored refrigerated away from light until
needed.

Process:

Fixing

  1.  Aspirate media from each well
  2. Washed with 1mL/well dPBS two times for 5 mins  10:23 ,  10:28   

  3.  Added  500 µL PFA to each well and incubated at room temperature for 15 min:  10:34 - 10:54   

  4. Aspirated PFA (disposed of in PFA waste container).
  5. Washed each well with  1mL/well dPBS two times for 5 mins  10:55 ,  11:10   

  

Permeabilise

1\. Aspirated PBS from each well.

2\. Added  500 µL/well PBST (0.2% Triton-X) to each well for 15 min:  11:16 -
11:31

3\. Aspirated PBST for each well.




Blocking

1\. Added  500 µL of blocking buffer (3% BSA in PBST [0.1% Triton-X]) and
incubate for 45 minutes - 1hr at RT. (no more than 1 hour):   10:32 - 12:20




Single/Simultaneous Primary Antibody staining

1\. Aspirated blocking buffer from each well.

2\. Incubated cells with primary antibody for 90min - 2hrs at RT, or 4ºC
overnight:   12:25 - 13:55  

3\. Parafilmed plates and stored at 4ºC in tissue culture lab Fridge.

After this step, all further task should be performed in a dark room. The
vessel should also be wrapped foil when not used.
