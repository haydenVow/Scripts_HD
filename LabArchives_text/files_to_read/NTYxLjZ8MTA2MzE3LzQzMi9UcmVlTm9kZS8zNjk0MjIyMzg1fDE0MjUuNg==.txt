### Process:

1\. Took image of vessel with microscope on phase setting.

2\. Gelatin coated    1      x     24 well plate     vessel with sterile
filtered 0.1% gelatin solution and then incubated all coated flasks at 37˚C.

  1. Time when all vessels(s) placed into the incubator       11:37am 

3\. Aliquotted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then
placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath for a minimum of 20 minutes
prior to use:

  1. TrypLE:     0.2    mL in     1    tubes
  2.  dPBS (for washing and neutralising):     1    mL in    1    tubes
  3. Growth media (for seeding):     2    mL in     1    tubes

Time that all aliquots were placed in the water bath the warm before use
12:38pm

Note: if aliquots were placed in water bath at different time, record the time
stamp for each individual solution.




4\. Removed vessel(s) from the incubator     12:40pm

5\. Washed the vessel(s) with dPBS (warmed).

6\. Added    0.2     mL tryple to each vessel/well and incubated at 37˚C.

  1. Start/Finish for TrypLE was    12:44-13:04pm 

7\. Neutralised with     0.5mL     dPBS and combined cell suspension into a
15mL    tube.

8\. Centrifuged at 650 x g for 5 min.

  1. Start/Finish time for centrifugation was     13:05-13:10pm 




9\. Aspirated the supernatant(s).

10\. Resuspended pellet(s) in     1    mL      Endothelial growth    media
13:10 pm




  

11\. Transferred entire cell suspension into the pre-gelatin coated      1
well of a 24 well plate      vessel.

12\. Transferred vessel(s) to incubate at: 13:13pm

  * [ x ]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (avian cells)

Observations/Summary:

Cells still look very long and thin with a fair bit of debris. Hard to see
what their morphology will look like when they are confluent.

Also seeing long thin shapes in gelatin alone, so I'm a bit worried that the
cells might all be dead.




### Results:

  * Results were;
    * [ ]  As Usual (this is a repetitive task)
    * [ x ]  Unexpected because...we may not have live cells
    * [ ]  Need to be further analysed
    * [ ]  Other (.......)
