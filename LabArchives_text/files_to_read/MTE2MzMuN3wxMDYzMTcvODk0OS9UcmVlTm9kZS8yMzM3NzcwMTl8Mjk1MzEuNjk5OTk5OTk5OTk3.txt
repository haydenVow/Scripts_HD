Took samples

  1. Unscrewed the "BENCHMARK" sample tube cover.
  2. Sprayed down the tube end with 70% ethanol.
  3. Connected a 5 mL sterile syringe.
  4. Withdrew slightly more than 3 mL (to purge the line).
  5. Discarded the 5 mL syringe.
  6. Connected a fresh sterile syringe and withdrew 3.5 - 4.0 mL of sample.
  7. Disconnected sample syringe and transferred 1 mL of sample each to 3 x 1.5 mL Eppendorf tubes for subsequent analysis:
    * Performed ViCell count
    * Performed manual cell count
    * Tested pH offline
    * Prepared sample for offline biochemistry analyses: "Biostat 18-July-2022" placed in red rack
      * 250uL taken from sample
      * diluted 1:2 with equal volume of dH2O (not PBS) 
      * Quick spin for 1 minute
      * Reserve supernatant in new 1.5mL tube and discarded pellet. Input sample info into datasheet here for later analysis offsite. Stored in sample box at -20degC
  8. Sprayed sample tube end and cap with 70% ethanol, re-attached cap.
