### Process:

1\. Took image of vessel with Zaber on 5x, phase (whole well) and DAPI (whole
well and center).

2\. Added 500uL/well of growth media to 30 wells (spread across 2x 24 wp).
Placed plates in the incubator to warm. 10:17

3\. Aliquotted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then
placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath for a minimum of 20 minutes
prior to use:

  1. TrypLE:      3   mL in     1    tubes
  2.  dPBS (for washing):     4.5    mL

Time that all aliquots were placed in the water bath the warm before use    10
:24  

Note: if aliquots were placed in water bath at different time, record the time
stamp for each individual solution.




4\. Removed vessel(s) from the incubator     10:33

5\. Washed the vessel(s) with dPBS (100uL/well, warmed).

6\. Added    50 uL/well      tryple to each vessel/well and incubated at 37˚C.

  1. Start/Finish for TrypLE was     10:40 - 10:55 

7\. Neutralised wells by adding 150uL/well of growth media from the
destination well. Mixed the cell suspension and then transferred it to the
destination well (in 24 wp).




16\. Transferred vessel(s) to incubate at: 11:15

  * [X]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells), incubator #68  

  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (avian cells)




Observations/Summary:

all conditions have live cells (based on morphology on phase). We expected the
condition with 8uL/well of staining solution over 24h to affect cell viability
but this was not observed.

Passaged 6 out of the 12 wells for each condition. I've kept 6 wells for each
condition so that we can observe whether cell viability goes down over 48h or
72h.
