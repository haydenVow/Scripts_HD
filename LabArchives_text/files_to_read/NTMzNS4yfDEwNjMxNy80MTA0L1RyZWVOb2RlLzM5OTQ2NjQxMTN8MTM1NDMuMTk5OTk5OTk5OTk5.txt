## Remove the Stimulation Lead Wire

1\. Removed the hook test clips from the electrode connection pins on the
culture dish lid for plate 2 (7996)  
  
The test hook can be released from the pin by squeezing the spring loaded test
hook handle. It is best not to touch the metal electrode pins while doing
this. Hold the plastic culture dish lid for stability. If any wires become
dislodged and the operator is unsure about reattachment, contact experiment
owner for assistance   Jared - 0420881185




## Imaging

1\. Imaged PLATE 2, taking whole well images of every well using the zaber
17:43  

For information on how to use the zaber, refer to:

Tips for imaging the 12WP are to use 8x8 imaging sites in the HSC site
generator, remembering to change the spacing rule to field of view with 60 um
spacing. Remember to build the MM List in the HSC site generator and confirm
the number of images expected (usually >700) in the Mult-D Acq.




Fix Timepoint 2 (PLATE 2)  
  
Process:

Fixing Plate 1 ( ~ 20 - 30 min):

  1. Aliquoted  2 x 50 mL of PBS into  2 x 50 mL falcon tubes and  13 mL  4% PFA into   1x 15 mL  falcon tube. 
  2. Placed in the water bath and warmed for a minimum of 10 mins.   11:20 - 11:40    

  3. Removed media from each well and wash with warmed PBS twice. 
  4.  Added   1mL warmed PFA for 15 min:   12:00 - 12:15pm   

  5. Removed PFA (and add in PFA waste container) and wash wells twice with   2 mL warmed PBS. 
  6. Wrapped plate in parafilm and placed in the   fixing and staining   fridge for later staining   12:30pm 




### Observations/Summary:

Cells had lifted off prior to fixing and had formed sheets/balls of cells

Some more lifting occured as cells were fixed and washed

Tried best to leave floating sheets/balls in supernatant
