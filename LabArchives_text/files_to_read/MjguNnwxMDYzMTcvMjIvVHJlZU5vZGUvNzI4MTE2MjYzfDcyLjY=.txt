Cell doubling time  
  
  
Do we also want to measure biomass doubling time?  
Peak cell density (cells/mL)  
  
  
  
  
Wet biomass yield (g/L)  
  
  
Wet biomass yield may be estimated pre-harvest or measured post-harvest -- the
latter is ultimately more important but the former may be useful for R&D
purposes.  
  
Target water content to be determined with Product team. Current assumption of
70% water content.
