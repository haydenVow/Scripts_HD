AIM/PURPOSE: To asses variations in cell viability after freezing and thawing
cells in DMSO + 10% FBS, Cryostor and DMSO-free Cryostor.

HYPOTHESIS: There will be no difference in F_CHOMP09 cell doubling times
between cells frozen in DMSO + 10% FBS, Cryostor and DMSO-free Cryostor.

RESULTS SUMMARY: N=1 for the thawing of vials from each cryopreservation
media, so no statistically significant inferences can be made from this data.
At the first passage post thaw however, F_CHOMP09 doubling times were shortest
for cells frozen in DMSO-free Cryostor followed by standard Cryostor and
lastly by DMSO + 10% FBS.

CONCLUSIONS: While it is important to note that N=1 for each group, the
hypothesis was not supported. Cell doubling times did vary between groups,
with DMSO-free Cryostor performing best in terms of cell doubling times, with
DMSO-free Cryostor having the shortest doubling time.  

NEXT STEPS: These results support the use  of DMSO-free Cryostor for the
cryopreservation of our CHOMP cells. As this is a chemically defined, animal
component + DMSO-free freeze media, it has great advantages over FBS
containing media from a QMS perspective. CHOMP MCB and WCBs should therefore
be stored in a Cryostor freeze medium in future.
