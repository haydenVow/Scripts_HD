Perform bank using below volumes:

  




## Performed by: Bonnie Tangey




Note

I additionally planned to do another passage prior to banking the WCB. At
todays count however, there was already >35 cells (target was >30M), and were
therefore banked.

Media/Reagents used:

  

NameDetails (reagent ID)  
Tryple A10658  
dPBS (for washing & neutralising) A10945  
OpriPRO +4mM Glutamax M10148  
Cryostor CS10 S5337  
  
  

  




Process:

 1\. Aliquotted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and
then placed all aliquots to warm in the water 37C bath 20 minutes prior to
use.

  1.  TrypLE:  40mL
  2.  dPBS (for neutralising)    40mL 



  1. Washed the flask(s) with dPBS. 
  2. Added |10 |mL tryple to each vessel/well and incubated at 37ÂºC for | 10 | min.
  3. Neutralised with |10  | dPBS (warmed) and transferred to 2x 50mL falcon tubes
  4. Centrifuged at 500 x g for 5 min    




5\. Aspirated the supernatant(s), leaving 11mL behind in each of the 2 tubes,.

7\. Resuspend pellet(s) | remaining  | media, and combined into a single tube.

8\. Performed a cell count using the haemocytometer and recorded the cell
count data in the Google Doc spreadsheet called 'Cell Count Spreadsheet' (see
link below):

SSIBtIylyrBQE5kRX5Z8NtI/edit#gid=0

9\. Total cell number was: | 35,024,000 |




10\. Centrifuged cells at 500 x g for 5 min.

11\. Aspirated supernatant and re-suspended cells in 10mL Cryostor CS10 (3.5M
cells/mL)

12\. Transferred 1mL cell suspension into 10x cryovials

13\. Transferred to a pre-chilled Mr. Frosty, and then to the -80C freezer.
These will be moved to N2 on Monday.
