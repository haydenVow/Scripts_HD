Prepare reagents:

Prepare working solutions of thrombin to yield 6U/mL and 12U/mL final
concentration when adding 25uL working solution to 200uL fibrinogen hydrogel
solution. Stock concentration is 12U/uL.

  * 3uL stock into 250uL dH2O (96U/mL). Add 25uL working solution to gel preparation (200uL) for final concentration of 12U/mL
  * 1.5uL stock into 250uL dH2O (48U/mL). Add 25uL working solution to gel preparation (200uL) for final concentration of 6U/mL
  * 1uL stock into 1000uL dH2O (8U/mL). Add 25uL working solution to gel preparation (200uL) for final concentration of 1U/mL
  * keep at 4째C

Experimental notes and emendations

  * compared to previous pilot experiment, some changes have been made to following iteration based on observations
  * No cells were used in this iteration - only hydrogel formulation was plated for staining and imaging to observe gel protein structure
  * new concentrations trialled for this iteration have been adapted from Vorwald et al 2020
    * fibrinogen content has been altered to 10mg/mL final concentration of fibrin in hydrogel (previously 8mg/mL)
    * alginate altered to 1.5% (w/v) final concentration in hydrogel
    * thrombin final concentration in hydrogel has been varied (previously 12.5U/mL final)
    * incubation times altered: ECM+alginate component 30 minutes at 37째C followed by alginate cross linking for 10 minutes at room temperature

Method

1\. Cut strip of parafilm and overlaid on empty P10 tip box. Used eppendorf
tube to make indentations in tip spaces to create wells in parafilm

2\. Label eppendorf tubes A-D

3\. Draw up alginate using 10mL syringe. Fix needle to syringe, keep in falcon
tube until needed

4\. Added 100uL alginate to each eppendorf tube, using tube graduations as
indication of volume dispensed.

5\. Added 100uL fibrinogen/ECM to eppendorf tube

6\. Added 25uL of thrombin working solution to eppendorf tube and gently mixed
by stirring motion with pipette. (Added to tube only when ready to pipette)

7\. Used P200 to dispense droplets onto parafilm in each well. Dispensed ~10
droplets per formulation

8\. Incubated at 37째C for 30 minutes (entire strip of parafilm placed in a 6cm
dish and placed in incubator)

9\. Removed from incubation and added CaCl2 directly onto parafilm to bathe
droplets, and cross-link alginate

10\. Incubated parafilm strip at room temperature in BSC for 10 minutes

11\. Aspirated media from parafilm. Used tweezers to push microbeads into well
containing PBS as per plate layout above.  

  

No plate ID was created - hydrogels were stained and imaged. Following
imaging, hydrogels were discarded.

  



  




Staining & Imaging

  1. Gels were stained with Coomassie blue stain using Bradford reagent
  2. Added 0.5mL staining reagent per well and incubated at 30째C for 5 minutes
  3. Aspirated stain and rinsed 3 times with DPBS 




Observations:

  * parafilm dispensing technique is easier handling compared to syringe dispensation. However would require more creative thinking for scaleable dispensation 
  * Coomassie blue staining indicates some structure in CHOMP ECM precipitate-alginate encapsulation formula (see imaging). Less structure visible in collagen I and Matrigel formulations
