Operator(s): JH  VB

Location Acquired: Cronulla Wharf, deep seawater, past the headlands, Sydney
Australia. Performed by Adem, Kylie, and Jasper with the aid of fishermen on a
charter boat. The Sharks were immediately sacrificed by professional
experienced fishermen to ensure no the sharks experienced the least pain
possible.

To ensure the shark's cellular viability was maintained, the sharks were
immediately placed in an icebox filled with ice.  
Arrival time, location and storage condition: Arrived deceased at the Vowse,
Alexandria (6 Ralph St)  ~13:00 in a white icebox filled with ice.

ID of each shark: 10017 - 10021

Location of Biopsy: Yurt Lab

Note: Amendments that include removed steps and additional steps have been
made to the original protocol and this has been indicated by crossed-out lines
and text coloured in green (respectively).

# Biopsy 1 - Completed by James H

  1.  ~~Spray the body of the sacrificed shark very liberally with bleach for 20 minutes.   ~~ ~~  : - :  pm~~
  2.  ~~Spray the body of the sacrificed shark very liberally with 70% EtOH.  Completed within ~~
  3. With a Kitchen Knife, remove the tail from the body of the shark. completed by Adem K within 1:30 - 2:00pm
    1. location: caudal to the pelvic fin, 15cm in length distal towards the tail 
  4. Ensure the entire body tail  of the shark has been covered in ethanol ~~before removing the head and cutting open the belly with a clean knife.~~   Before transferring to the BSC. Completed by James H within timeframe 1:30 - 2:00pm 
  5. Place the tail tissue segment in the Yurt lab BSC. 
  6.  ~~Wear new sterile surgical gloves~~
  7.  ~~Wipe ethanol on the surface of the fish and on gloves~~

  9. Create sharp dissections to lift the 2x large muscle layers surrounding the tail vertebrae to expose the vertebral column
  10. Create sharp dissections using sterile scalpels, and scissors to separate the muscle surrounding the vertebral biopsies from the tissue segment to ensure we detach muscle at the site of their vertebral attachment and make sure we can readily lift the vertebral/ cartilaginous biopsies from the tail tissue segment ~~  to remove the surface layers of shark muscle along the spine and rib regio~~n. 
  11. Place the biopsy (6x vertebrae) in 10mL of wash media.

  14.  ~~Drop PBS with anti/anti (with a 10mL syringe) on the surface of the tissue exposed to prevent it from drying ou~~ t. 
  15. Take 6 x vertebrae biopsies to create biopsy 1 for ID 10017 shark. Completed by James H during 2:00-2:22 pm.

# BIOPSY 4: Pelvic Fin Microdissection to access sterile fin cartilaginous
tissue by Varshana B

 ~~I~~ ~~f Dora~~ l Pelvic fin was segmented from the tail by Adem
(1:30-2:00pm and transferred to a petri dish) (duration of biopsy attempt:
4:30-4:50pm)

  1. The fin segment was sprayed with ethanol and left for 10 minutes 4:14-4:32
  2. Using sterile scissors and scalpels the skin of the fin was 'skinned' from the fin. 
  3. Attempted dissection of cartilage at the site of attachment of the pelvic fin to the tail fin ~~. are dissected:  ~~
  4. Sterility was compromised and the tissue was discarded.  
  

  5.  ~~Using a sharp sterile knife cut each fin off and transfer onto a sterile plastic sheet~~
  6.  ~~Dab fins with iodine and incubate at RT for  5 mins, and transfer into the yurt lab.   : - :  pm~~
  7.  ~~Dab iodine soaked samples dry with sterile gauze.~~
  8.  ~~Using a sterile scalpels and autocaved scissors to remove the skin from each fin.~~
  9.  ~~Using a sterile scalpel and tweezers, collect 3 x 3g cartilage samples, and one connective tissue sample from dorsal/pectoral fin and transfer into 50mL sterile centrifuge tubes.   : pm~~
  10.  ~~Place samples in the fridge at 4 Â°C until further use in isolation.  ~~ ~~: pm~~

Observations/Summary:

# FINDINGS from exploratory microdissection of tail vertebral/cartilaginous
tissue (Observed by Varshana B)

  *  This technique is a quick and efficient approach to accessing sterile veterbral/cartilaginous segments of tissue. However, it needs to be optimised for it to be:  
    * repeatable 
    * safe 
    * efficient and
    * easily learned by future biopsy operators. 
  * The access to these biopsies as unsafe and inefficient as it resulted in broken scalpels and scissors, unsafe scalpel handling practice/ non-dominant hand placed in the direction of the scalpel.
  * We need to create a more user-friendly LA template for microdissection optimisation (for the purpose of accessing sterile biopsies) that ensures we can readily modify the protocol as we go and the scribe/ record-keeper is able to rapidly write the observations and exploratory findings that the operator discovers. 
    * Note as of 28/04/2022: Refer to 22 apr 2022 Biopsy #2 to observe the improved biopsy template. https://au-mynotebook.labarchives.com/share/Vow%2520-%2520R&D/MTAxNDYuNXwxMDYzMTcvNzgwNS9UcmVlTm9kZS80MjM2MzMzMDU0fDI1NzU2LjU=
  * We need to perform non-sterile dissection 'practice'  to better understand internal anatomy.

# FINDINGS from exploratory microdissection of Pelvic Fin tissue (Observed by
Varshana B)

  * We cannot maintain sterility. The next fin biopsy should be accessed via sterile dissection that occurs within the BSC and the cartilage is accessed from deep tissue underneath, and then the operator should travel superficially, rather than starting to access tissue externally. 
  * We need to perform non-sterile dissection 'practice' to better understand internal anatomy.
