### Process:

1\. Took image of vessel with microscope on phase setting.

3\. Aliquotted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then
placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath for a minimum of 20 minutes
prior to use:

  1. TrypLE:     12   mL in     1    tubes
  2.  dPBS (for neutralising):     12    mL
  3.  dPBS (for washing):     5 x 2mL    mL
  4. Growth media (for seeding):    25   mL 

Time that all aliquots were placed in the water bath the warm before use
14:36 pm

Note: if aliquots were placed in water bath at different time, record the time
stamp for each individual solution.




4\. Removed vessel(s) from the incubator     14:57 pm

5\. Washed the vessel(s) with dPBS (warmed).

6\. Added     2    mL tryple to each vessel/well and incubated at 37˚C.

  1. Start/Finish for TrypLE was     15:06 - 15:21 pm 

7\. Neutralised with     2mL     dPBS and combined cell suspension into a
1 tube per clone.

8\. Centrifuged at 650 x g for 5 min.

  1. Start/Finish time for centrifugation was     15:33 pm 




9\. Aspirated the supernatant(s).

10\. Resuspended each pellet(s) in     5    mL     Growth     media     15:44
pm

  




  

14\. Transferred cell suspension into the      T25 flasks .

16\. Transferred vessel(s) to incubate at: 15:48 pm  

  * [ X]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (avian cells)




Observations/Summary:

5 clones expanded from 6-well plate to T25 flasks (1 flask each)
