Electrical stimulation has been shown to have a positive effect on the
maturation of skeletal muscle stem cells.

  

Copy over Jared's table and add what you have found. Summarise the parameters
used in literature - talk about the effect of the frequency, voltage and
duration of stimulation used, as well as the timing (early onset vs late
onset).

We have ordered the PulsePal, which is a stimulator capable of providing a
work-rest ratio

  

Lid prototyping

We are also in the process of making the switch to a 24 well format to
increase our number of replicates = more tests / stains / assays to try
Purchasing / utilising Pt electrodes (which are superior to the stainless
steel electrodes that are being used at present) Higher effective V/cm by
reducing the inter-electrode distance (we don't want to exceed 6x rheobase
though).

  

Parameters used in literature:

'stimulation was started after 1 day and continued for 5 days with 10 V peak
to peak and 50 Hz frequency.'

'Too high voltages typically cause electroporation, which plays a greater role
in electrochemical damage than pulse width. Electrical damage has been
observed above 2.5 V/mm and at frequencies over 3 Hz'

Other effects:

'Electrical stimulation while greatly affected the cell alignment and fiber
formation, did not influence the protein content of samples.'

'When two-dimensional cultures were stimulated at high frequencies (100 Hz),
this resulted in an increase in the rate of protein synthesis' (Donnelly,
2010)
