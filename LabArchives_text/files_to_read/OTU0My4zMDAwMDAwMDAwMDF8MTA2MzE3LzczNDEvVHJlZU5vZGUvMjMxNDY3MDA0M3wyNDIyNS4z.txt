Process:

  1. Aliquotted  13,500  mL of  D/F+20%FBS
  2. Placed in water bath   9:10AM 
  3. Removed  100  % of supernatant from vessel. 
  4. Replaced with  1,500 (FOR 10CS) or 750mL (For 5CS) per vessel  of  Growth   media. 
  5. Returned vessel to incubate at:   14:50 

  * [X ]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells) in the library lab
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (aviary cells)

  

  * Incubator (# 77,78), Lab [Main/Library/Production]
