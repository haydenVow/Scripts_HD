# Observations of Biopsy round 1:

  1. #### Please remove the culture plate from the incubator and observe using the axio microscope at 10x phase or 20x if this is easier.

  2. #### Observe the wells that have a yellow sticker placed near them and search for any normal or abnormal cell morphology.

    * #### Examples of Observations can include:

      * #### Cloudy growth media indicative of a potential contamination 

      * #### Cells (fibroblast-like) adhered to the cell culture plate 

      * #### A lot of debris suspended in the growth medium. 

  3. #### Write any interesting findings in the green columns for Biopsy round 1 and 2.

  4. #### Return the cell culture plate to their respective incubator (noted in the table below).

Observations/Summary:

  * MEM- basal medium cultures (in uncoated and collagen-coated) appear to have a significant amount of debris compared to the other culture conditions, which were sourced from the same type of growth medium condition There are very few rounded objects adhered to the tissue culture plate 
  * LDF-basal medium cultures have very minimal debris and yet also have very minimal circular objects that have migrated from the explant tissue 
  * RPMI-basal medium cultures have small populations of spherical objects adhered to the tissue culture plates (regardless of coating) 
  * ethanol washing is potentially severely cytoxtic to the biopsy tissue which is intended to be directly repeated. 
  * washing may not be necessary for tissue that is sourced within the BSC and obtained from a deep sterile region of the shark tissue.   
  

  * We need to improve biopsy technique for efficiency and safety.
