Findings  
\- After 8 days, the sample treated with 50ug/mL of Vitamin C +5ng/mL of TGFb
had formed a single clump of cells, which had detached from the culture dish.
The sample treated with  50ug/mL of Vitamin C -5ng/mL of TGF on the other
hand, had formed a sheet of cells which became attached from the culture dish
in a single sheet upon tyrpelisation. Untreated samples did not for cell
sheets or aggregates.  
\- At days 1 and day 8, samples treated with 50ug/mL of Vitamin C without
TGFb, had a greater biomass compared to those with TGFb or untreated controls.  
\- Samples treated with 50ug/mL of Vitamin C showed the greatest increase in
biomass between days 1 and 8.  
\- The addition of 5ng/mL of TGFb to Vitamin C treated culture media did not
improve sheet formation or increase biomass.

Discussion  
As mentioned in the background section of this experiment, we have previously
found that treatment of confluent flasks with 50ug/mL Vitamin C + 5ng/mL  TGFb
leads to the formation of cell sheets, and an increase in harvested biomass
(See previous experiments in the section at: https://au-
mynotebook.labarchives.com/share/Vow%2520-%2520Team%2520Science/OTYuMnwxMDYzMTcvNzQvVHJlZU5vZGUvMzI3Mjc1MDU4MXwyNDQuMg==).
So far though, it has been unclear if TGFb is necessary for this process. The
results of this experiment indicate that sufficient gains can be achieved in
the presence of Vitamin C alone. While there was not a stark difference
between +/-TGFb  at Day 1, by Day 8, the Vitamin C only culture appeared to be
superior. After 8 days in supplemented culture, Vitamin C only cultures
outperformed Vitamin C +TGFb in terms of cell sheet formation as well as the
of the biomass produced.

Limitations  
N=1 for treated samples making so we are cannot be sure of the statistical
significance of our findings.  
We do not have data for Day 0 weights of the samples. This would be of benefit
to assess the impact of 24hr versus 8 Day treatments.

Conclusions  
We have previously demonstrated that pre-harvest 24hr treatment of confluent
cells with Vitamin C and TGFb increases harvested biomass. We now see that
longer periods this media supplementation can further increase our harvest. We
also saw that Vitamin C treatment alone is superior to Vitamin C +TGFb
treatment.
