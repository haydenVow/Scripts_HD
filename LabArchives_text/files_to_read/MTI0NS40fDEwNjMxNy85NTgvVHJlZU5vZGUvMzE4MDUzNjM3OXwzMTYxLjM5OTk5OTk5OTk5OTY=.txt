  * [ ]  DMEM/F12 + 20% FBS + 1X P/S + 25ng/mL FGF-basic + P38i (10uM)

Total media required: 150mL

Total p38i required: 75 uL




Reagent preperation

1\. Aliquotted  150 mL  mL of  Growth Media into  1x 300mL     tube(s). Placed
in water bath 10 : 30 am (once waterbath had reached 37'C).




T175 Process

2\. Removed  50  % of supernatant from vessel.

3\. Replaced with  15 mL (per well/per vessel) of  growth   media.

4\. Returned vessel to incubate at:   timestamp

  * [x]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (aviary cells)

  

  * [x]  Thermo Incubator (ID #13)
  * [ ]  Top Sanyo Incubator (ID #25)
  * [ ]  Bottom Sanyo Incubator
  * [ ]  Top Binder Incubator
  * [ ]  Bottom Binder Incubator

  




Cell factory Process

  1. Unscrew white cap and remove blue cap and place aside.
  2. Removed  `50`  % of supernatant (300 mL) from 1 x 4CF by carefully pouring into a waste container with 300mL marked.
  3. Replaced with  `300` mL (per flask) of  `growth`   media by carefully pouring media through the white cap opening (alternatively you may use a 50mL serological to add media.)
  4. Place caps back and equalise 4CF by placing it on its side (blue cap on the bottom and white cap on the top, see image below:)  
  

4\. Returned vessel to incubate at 11:40:

  * [x]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (aviary cells)

  

  * [x]  Thermo Incubator (ID #13)
  * [ ]  Top Sanyo Incubator (ID #25)
  * [ ]  Bottom Sanyo Incubator
  * [ ]  Top Binder Incubator
  * [ ]  Bottom Binder Incubator
