### Process:

1\. Inspected wells under the microscope, 5x objective to observe which clones
were 100% confluent. Wells 100% confluent were set up for passage below.

2\. Filled one well on a 6 well plate with 3mL of growth media (DMEM/F12 + 20%
FBS + 1xP/S) for each clone destined to be picked




  

3\. Plates were removed from the incubator and all supernatant was aspirated
and discarded.

4\. Wells were washed with 1mL of dPBS, washes were then discarded and
replaced with 1mL of Tryple+EDTA before plates were returned to incubate at 30
degrees, 5% CO2 for 8-12 minutes.

5\. 100uL of the trypalised cells were aspirated and placed in a new
destination well in pre warmed media prepared in step 2.  

6\. Destination plates were moved to incubator 82 to incubate at 30 degrees,
5% CO2. The remaining cells were discarded.




Observations/Summary:

As clones were not counted prior to passage, seeding density will be different
between each culture as a result.
