Passaged the 20% serum adapted CHOMP cells into new vessels today.  
  
Cells were passaged as normal out of 5xT75 flasks (ID's 13145-13149)

  1. Cells were washed with sterile filtered dPBS 
  2. Wash was removed and cells were covered with 5mL of sterile filtered tryple-EDTA per flask. 
  3. Cells were incubated for 30 degrees at 5% CO2 for 10 minutes. 
  4. Cells were collected into 50mL tubes and flasks were washed down with equal volumes of dPBS to tryple 
  5. Washes were also collected to the same tubes 
  6. Cells were centrifuged at 650g for 5 minutes to pellet 
  7. Supernatant was discarded and cells were resuspended in 20mL of dPBS 
  8. 10uL of cells were taken in triplicate for a trypan blue stain at a 1:2 dilution followed by a count under a hemocytometer. (see cell count entry here https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1DPzKubYxfHmWogVPihC-SSIBtIylyrBQE5kRX5Z8NtI/edit#gid=0&range=2683:2686)
  9. Cells were centrifuged once more as per above and then resuspended in 20mL of growth media (mix13331, D/F12 + 20% FBS + 1xP/S) 

Cells Count average = 4,133,333 cells

5mL of cell suspension (1.03x10^6 cells) was then seeded into 3x T175 flask
containing 30mL of growth media (ID's 13222-13224. 5.16x10^5 cells (2.5mL) was
seeded into 2xT75 flasks containing 12mL of media (ID's 13225-13226).
