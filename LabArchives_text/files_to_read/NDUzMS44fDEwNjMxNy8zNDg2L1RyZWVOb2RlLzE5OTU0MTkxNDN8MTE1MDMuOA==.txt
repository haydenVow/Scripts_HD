### Process:

1\. Took image of vessel with microscope on phase setting.

3\. Aliquotted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then
placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath for a minimum of 20 minutes
prior to use:

  1. TrypLE:    45     mL in     1    tubes
  2.  dPBS (for washing neutralising):     (1 x 6mL) (2 x 10mL) (2 x 30mL) 
  3. Growth media (for pellet resuspension):      12mL (20% FBS) + 4mL (10% FBS)   mL
  4. Growth media (for seeding):     2 x 100mL (20% FBS) + 42mL (10% FBS)    mL 

Time that all aliquots were placed in the water bath the warm before use
13:24 pm

Note: if aliquots were placed in water bath at different time, record the time
stamp for each individual solution.




4\. Removed vessel(s) from the incubator   13:40 pm

5\. Washed the vessel(s) with dPBS (warmed).

6\. Added   see table above  mL tryple to each vessel/well and incubated at
37˚C.

  1. Start/Finish for TrypLE was   13:50 - 14:05 pm 

7\. Neutralised with   equal volume of tryple:pbs   dPBS and combined cell
suspension into a    1 x tube per clone  tube.

8\. Centrifuged at 650 x g for 5 min.

  1. Start/Finish time for centrifugation was  14:16 pm 




9\. Aspirated the supernatant(s).

10\. Resuspended pellet(s) in    1mL (3P23) 3mL (6H14 & 2O14) 4mL (F_DOLLY12 &
1A16)  mL   Growth (10% FBS for F_DOLLY12/ 20% FBS for clones)    media

11\. Aliquoted    10uL      of resuspended cells into a microcentrifuge tube
for cell count.

12\. Performed a cell count using the haemocytometer and recorded the cell
count data in the Google Doc spreadsheet: Cell Count Spreadsheet or cell count
widget below




F_DOLLY12 (mixed population)

  1. Transferred  468   µL of cell suspension to the pre-warmed  30   mL Growth media: (for T175 seeding)  

  2. Transferred  122   µL of cell suspension to the pre-warmed  12   mL Growth media: (for 24-well plate seeding)
  3. Transferred cell suspension into a     1 x T175 & 1 x 24-well plate (500uL/well)   vessels.
  4. Transferred vessel(s) to incubate at:   : pm

  3. Transferred vessel(s) to incubate at:   : pm 

F_DOLLY12_6H14

  1. Transferred  all   µL of cell suspension to the pre-warmed  30  mL Growth media:

  3. Transferred vessel(s) to incubate at:   : pm 

F_DOLLY12_1A16

  1. Transferred  all  µL of cell suspension to the pre-warmed   120  mL Growth media:
