Results

BIOPSY  
A total of 4 biopsies were collected. 2 biopsies were collected from the
vastus lateralis and 2 from the biceps femoris. Each biopsy was processed
following Vows standard protocol for the isolation of primary cells from
mammalian muscle tissue. 3/4 of the isolate extracted from each biopsy was
frozen as crude homogenate, while the remaining 1/4 was placed into immediate
culture.  
  
ESTABLISHMENT OF ADHERENT CULTURES  
On day 14 in culture, adherent cell populations were first observed in WALLE02
and WALLE04. These cultures were derived from vastus lateralis biopsies, with
the cell isolations performed on the day of the biopsy

No adherent cell population was established for WALLE03 or WALLE05. These
cultures were derived from biceps femoris biopises, with the cell isolations
performed on the day following the biopsy.

PASSAGES  
WALLE02 and WALLE04 underwent 2 passages. WALLE04 cell numbers did not
increase between passages, while WALLE02 numbers actually decreased (see table
below)  
WALLE02 and WALLE04 had very few cells re-adhere to the culture vessel
following their 2nd passage and the remaining population did not proliferate.  
  
TERMINATION OF CULTURES  
WALLE03 and WALLE05 were terminated after 24 days as we were unable to
establish an adherent population from these cultures.  
WALLE02 and WALLE04 were terminated after 40 days due to stunted
proliferation.
