Process
  
  
  1. Took 1 x 560 uL aliquot from each E500 and E1000 and performed counts on ViCell
  2. Recorded counts in media results spreadsheet: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1cnmEz5amKSGmA9u3BJ-Dn0w-I7zFobBr6pG-UWCYaXM/edit#gid=595130609
  3. Prepared 300 mL of 50/50 RPMI/CHO medium + IGF + EGF 
    1. Added 5.9 mL and 3 mL of L-glutamine and glucose solutions respectively
  4. Prepared 200 mL of 75/25 RPMI/CHO medium + IGF + EGF 
    1. Added 3.2 mL and 3 mL of L-glutamine and glucose solutions respectively
  5. Placed media in waterbath 
  6. Added 150 mL 50/50 medium to each E1000 (total 450 mL per flask)
    * Note: straining yesterday reduced volume in flasks, so actual volume is closer to 420 mL per flask
  7. Added 100 mL 75/25 medium to 2 new E1000s
  8. Moved 75/25 cell suspensions to E1000s each containing 100 mL media (total 300 mL per flask)
    * Note: straining yesterday reduced volume in flasks, so actual volume is closer to 270 mL per flask
  9. Replaced flasks in incubator (120 RPM, 37'C, 5% CO2)
