## Performed by: Nathan.  




### Process:

Continuous agitation to facilitate adhesion

  1. Counted cell suspension 3520000cells/mL
  2. Transferred select volumes of DOLLY12 cell suspension from the attached passage (https://au-mynotebook.labarchives.com/share/Vow%2520-%2520Team%2520Science/NjAzLjJ8MTA2MzE3[…]k4My9UcmVlTm9kZS80OTIzNTE5MzF8MTUzMS4xOTk5OTk5OTk5OTk4 ) into each of the equilibrated microcarrier suspensions. 
    1. 774000 cells into each 50mL tube (4 cells per carrier), 220uL per vessel (1.319mL total)
    2. 2322000 cells into each E125 flask (4 cells per carrier), 660uL per vessel (1.98mL total)

  1. Transferred vessel to incubate shaking at their respective speeds above in the incubator.

  * [x]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (aviary cells)




### SOPs used:

  




### Observations/Summary:

  

230rpm seems to be the critical shaking speed for the 50mL tubes.




### Results

  * Results were;
    * [x]  As Usual (this is a repetitive task)
    * [ ]  Unexpected because...
    * [ ]  Need to be further analysed
    * [ ]  Other (.......)
