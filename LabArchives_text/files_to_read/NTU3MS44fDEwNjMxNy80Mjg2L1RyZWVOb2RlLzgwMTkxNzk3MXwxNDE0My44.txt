Images run through new DAPI macro on Mia (Vow tool found on Retool):

  

Note* many inaccuracies were noticed for this specific macro, and the
suspension DAPI macro was deemed more suitable by Addy, Adrian and Alex Ward,
therefore the suspension macro was used to re-analyse the images for more
accurate DAPI counts.

Raw data transported to GraphPad (Prism 8) to generate Mean and Std Dev.
values for all graphs.

 Graph 1. Line graph plotting mean cell count values across 10 days after
differentiation for each cell line (in E6 and 2% HS). Std. dev. shown with
error bars for each data point. N = 8 for each data point.






  
Graph 2. Plot graph of mean cell counts per well across 10 days of
differentiation for DOLLY12 cells in E6 and 2% HS Differentiation Media. Error
bars show standard deviation. n = 8 for each data point.



Graph 3. Plot graph of mean cell counts per well across 10 days of
differentiation for DAISY4 cells in E6 and 2% HS differentiation media. Error
bars show standard deviation. N = 8 for each data point

  

Graph 4. Plot graph of mean cell counts per well across 10 days of
differentiation for BUFFY6 cells in E6 and 2% HS differentiation media. Error
bars show standard deviation. N = 8 for each data point

  
Graph 5. Plot graph of mean cell counts per well across 10 days of
differentiation for C2C12 cells in E6 and 2% HS differentiation media. Error
bars show standard deviation. N = 8 for each data point.










 Graph 6. Plot graph comparing the normalised cell counts of C2C12 and DOLLY12
cells across 10 days of differentiation, each in E6 and 2% HS differentiation
media. Error bars show standard deviation. N = 8 for each data point.






Graph 7. Plot graph comparing the normalised cell counts for all primary cell
lines across 10 days of differentiation, each in E6 and 2% HS differentiation
media. All values normalised to Day 0 mean for that condition. Error bars show
standard deviation. N = 8 for each data point.
