### Process:

1\. Took image of vessel with microscope on phase setting.

2\. Aliquoted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then
placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath for a minimum of 20 minutes
prior to use:

  1. TrypLE:        50 mL in   1     tubes
  2.  dPBS (for neutralising):   50  mL
  3.  dPBS (for washing):      50  mL
  4. Growth media (for pellet resuspension + Seeding):   500   mL

Time that all aliquots were placed in the water bath the warm before use
TrypLE/PBS: 16:20  

Media: 16:39  

Note: if aliquots were placed in water bath at different time, record the time
stamp for each individual solution.




4\. Removed vessel(s) from the incubator  

5\. Washed the vessel(s) with dPBS (warmed).

6\. Added   10    mL tryple to each vessel/well and incubated at 37˚C.

  1. Start/Finish for TrypLE was   17:05 - 17:15   

7\. Neutralised with       10mL  dPBS and combined cell suspension into  4x
50ML tubes

8\. Centrifuged at 650 x g for 5 min.

  1. Start/Finish time for centrifugation was   17:31 - 17:36    




9\. Aspirated the supernatant(s).

10\. Resuspended pellet(s) in     10   mL      grwoth    media

11\. Aliquoted  50 ul per culture of resuspended cells into a microcentrifuge
tube for cell count.

12\. Performed a cell count using the haemocytometer and recorded the cell
count data in the Google Doc spreadsheet: Cell Count Spreadsheet or cell count
widget below

  1. Total cell number was:     23,640,000  

  2. Volume of cell suspension required for subculture was:         18,960,000/ 2,364,000  

  3. Cell density per vessel:    7500      




13\. Combined cultures and Transferred  cell suspension to the pre-warmed
600  mL Growth media:     18:06  

14\. Transferred cell suspension into 5 x T175   vessel.

16\. Transferred vessel(s) to incubate at: 18:20
