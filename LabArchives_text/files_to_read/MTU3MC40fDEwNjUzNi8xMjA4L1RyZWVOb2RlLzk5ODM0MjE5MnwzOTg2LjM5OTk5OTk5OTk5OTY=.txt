Procedure:

pH Reading

* The pH was checked again today because yesterdays readings were quite acidic despite a full bottle media change on Monday. Todays readings are a bit better, i will monitor the pH again tomorrow to decide wether or not to do a media change before the weekend. I have also tested some fresh media today to see what our usual baseline would be.

5mL was taken from the sampling port of each CelCradle bottle.

  1. Clamp the sampling port tube. 
  2. Sterilize the sampling port by spraying it heavily with 70% Ethanol.
  3. The excess ethanol was then wiped away with a RediWipe and a lure lock syringe was attached to the sampling port and 5mL was drawn out.  
NOTE: Avoid any back flow during the sampling process

  4. Re-clamp the sampling port and disconnect the syringe.
  5. Spray and wipe down the sampling port again with 70% Ethanol
  6. Transfer this media into a 15mL labelled tube
  7. Calibrate the pH meter using the 7.01 and 4.0 calibration solutions 
  8. Measure the pH for each flask.  
NOTE: When the pH meter is sitting in a solution for a long time it can
gradually increase its reading over time, to maintain consistent measurements
only the first pH reading when the probe stops 'thinking' should be taken
down.

10978 = 7.0, 7.2 after pH probe calibrated

10979 = 6.8, 7.3 after pH probe calibrated

Fresh media (cold): 7.1

Fresh media (warmed): 7.4
