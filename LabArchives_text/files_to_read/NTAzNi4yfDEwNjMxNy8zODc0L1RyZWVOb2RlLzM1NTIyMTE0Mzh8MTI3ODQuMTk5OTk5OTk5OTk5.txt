Breakdown of seeded wells:

Samples:  

Conical insert:

n=5 cell-laden collagen hydrogels on conical inserts (low steepness)

n=1 cell-laden collagen hydrogels on conical inserts (medium steepness)

n=1 cell-laden collagen hydrogels on conical inserts (high steepness)  

n=2 cell-free collagen hydrogels on conical inserts (low steepness)

n=1 cell-free collagen hydrogels on conical inserts (high steepness)

No insert:

n=1 cell-laden collagen hydrogels without inserts  

n=1 cell free collagen hydrogels without inserts

  

= 8 cell-laden samples total

= 4 no - cell samples in total

= 12 samples overall

  

Cell containing:

no insert samples will contain: 400ul collagen sol: 100ul cell suspension
(4:1) - final volume of 500 uL in each well

Conical insert samples will contain: 160 ul collagen sol: 40 ul cell
suspension (4:1) - final volume of 200 uL in each well

Cell free:

no insert samples: 400 uL collagen sol : 100uL growth media - final volume of
500 uL per well.

No cell conical insert samples will contain: 160 ul collagen sol: 40 ul growth
media  (4:1) - final volume of 200 uL in each well




Preparation Media :

Media requirements:

Cell containing:  
Collagen: 1.410 mL  
Media with cells : 0.390 mL (32.5M cells in 0.390uL of cell suspension media.
Each sample has a seeding density of 16.67M cells per mL)

total = 1.8 mL (500 uL + 6 x 0.2 mL)

Cell free:  
Collagen: ~0.93 mL  
Media (no cells): 0.270 mL

total = 1.2 mL (500 uL + 3x 0.2 mL)

  

For feed after seeding:  DMEM/F12 + 20% FBS + 1x P/S (with phenol red) ~16ml

For D1 feeds onward: Differentiation media E6 + 1x P/S (with phenol red)
~130ml for 1 week  

  




Prepare plate:

  1. Add sterile inserts into a non-treated 24-well plate (see plate map below). Place lid ontop and parafilm. Place the plate with the tray and inserts into the fridge for a minimum of 30min before seeding, 10 am 




Cell free seeding in gel

  1. Remove PureCol® EZ Gel solution from 4°C storage (fridge)
  2. Remove the 24 well plate from fridge and remove parafilm
  3. Add 0.270 uL of cold growth media to  0.93 mL of PureCol® EZ Gel 
  4. Whilst suspension is still cold, transfer cell free mix into the wells: 
    1. No insert: 500 uL directly in the middle (n=1)
    2. Conical insert: 200 uL onto the conical inserts (n=2)

Centrifuge 20  mL of cell suspension.

Re-suspend in 0.390ul of GM.

  

Cells-laden seeding in gel

  1. Prepare cell suspension (32.5M cells in 0.390uL  in GM and place in fridge at 4'C for a minimum of 10 minutes (~1hr max). 
  2. Remove PureCol® EZ Gel solution from 4°C storage (fridge)
  3. Add 0.390uL of the cold cell suspension to 1.410 mL of cold PureCol® EZ Gel solution (ratio of 4:1 gel:cells, based on: https://advancedbiomatrix.com/purecol-ezgel.html) 
  4. Remove the 24 well plate from fridge and remove parafilm
  5. Whilst the cell-gel mix is still cold seed the inserts (IMPORTANT TO BE QUICK SO MIX STAYS COLD):
    1. conical inserts: 300ul per well around the perimeter trough of the insert (n=4)
    2. no inserts: 600ul to the center of the well (n=1)  
  

  6. Move the plate containing the gels into the incubator (37°C, 5% CO2). Gelation will occur within 40 minutes, but allow approximately 60 to minutes for firm gel formation (should start almost immediately).
  7. After 60 minutes (or until gel is firm can take up to 90 min) add pre-warmed proliferation media to each well (DMEM/F12 + 20% FBS + 1x P/S + p38i, enough media to fully immerse samples ~1.5mls per well).  
  
Note - add media gently to the side of the well so as not to dislodge the gels
from the insert
