### Process:

1\. Took 2 x images of each vessel with microscope on phase setting (4X to
assess confluence)

2\. Aliquoted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then
placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath for a minimum of 20 minutes
prior to use:

  1. TrypLE:   16  mL in   1 x 50 mL  tube. Placed in waterbath: 11:21    

  2.  dPBS (for neutralising & washing):   35  mL. Placed in waterbath:  11:21   

  3. Growth media (for pellet resuspension):  5 mL (2mL per pellet) Placed in waterbath:  11:30    

  4. Growth media (for seeding): 2x   12  mL Placed in waterbath: 11:30  

Note: if aliquots were placed in water bath at different time, record the time
stamp for each individual solution.




CHOMP07  
Removed vessel from the incubator  11:35  

1\. Remove media and keep in a 50mL tube  
2\. Add 5mL dPBS to wash the flask. Then remove the dPBS and keep in the same
50mL tube containing the media.  
  
3\. Add 5mL tryple to the flask and place in the incubator for a minimum of
15min. Timestamp: 11:52 - 12:30  
  
4\. Place the 50mL tube containing the dPBS wash and media in the centrifuge
for 5 minutes at 650g. Timestamp: 11:58-12:03  
5\. Remove the supernatant and add 5mL of dPBS. Resuspend the pellet well.
Then Centrifuge at 650g for 5 min. Timestamp: 12:08-12:13  
6\. Centrifuge the tube down again and remove the dPBS and add 5mL of tryple.
Place in the incubator for a minimum of 15 minutes. Time stamp: 12:18 - 12:  
7\. Remove both the flask and 50mL tube containing the CHOMP07 cells.  
8\. Neutralise each in 5mL of dPBS and combine the cells into a single tube.  
8\. Centrifuge at 650g for 5minutes. Timestamp: 12:34 - 12:39  
9\. Remove the supernatant and resuspend in 2 mL of media.  
10\. Take 10uL sample for the cell count.

  

CHOMP09

3\. Removed vessel(s) from the incubator   11:35  

4\. Washed the vessel(s) with  5 mL per flask dPBS (warmed).

5\. Added   5  mL tryple to each vessel/well and incubated at 37˚C.

  1. Start/Finish for TrypLE was     11:55 - 12:10    

6\. Neutralised with   5 mL per flask   dPBS and moved the cell suspension
into   2 x 50 mL  tubes.

7\. Centrifuged at 650 x g for 5 min.

  1. Start/Finish time for centrifugation was  12:23 - 12:28   




8\. Aspirated the supernatant.

9\. Resuspended pellet in   2  mL   growth  medium  

10\. Aliquoted   11 uL  of resuspended cells into a microcentrifuge tube for
cell count.

11\. Performed a cell count using the haemocytometer and recorded the cell
count data in the Google Doc spreadsheet: Cell Count Spreadsheet or cell count
widget below

  1. Total cell number was:  
    * CHOMP07: 2,504,000   

    * CHOMP09: 2,280,000   

  2. Volume of cell suspension required for subculture was:  
    1. CHOMP07: 0.449   

    2. CHOMP09: 0.493
  3. Cell density per vessel:   7500 cells/cm2     




12\. Transferred the cell suspension of the following volume into the pre-
warmed   12 mL growth medium:  

  * CHOMP07:   0.449 uL     

  * CHOMP09:   0.493uL   

13\. Transferred cell suspension into   2x T75  vessels.

14\. Transferred vessel(s) to incubate at:  13:20  

  * [ ]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (avian cells)
  * [x]  30ºC, 5% CO2 (reptilian cells)
