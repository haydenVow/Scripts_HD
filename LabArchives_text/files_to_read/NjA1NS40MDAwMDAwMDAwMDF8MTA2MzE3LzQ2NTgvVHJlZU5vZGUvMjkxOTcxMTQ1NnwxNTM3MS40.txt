Note  
During the process of transferring typsilised cells to centrifuge tubes, about
1/4 of the cells were spilled and were therefore lost.  
  




Media/Reagents used:

  

NameDetails (reagent ID)  
Tryple M7548  
  
dPBS (for washing & neutralising) A7544, A7542  
  
Growth Media M6921  
  
FBS A6952, A6288  
  
DMSO  
 S2745  
  
  
  

  




Process:

 1\. Aliquotted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and
then placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath for a minimum of 20 minutes
prior to use:

  1.  TrypLE:  500mL in 1 tub
  2. dPBS (for washing)    500mL in | 1 | bottle
  3.  dPBS (for neutralising)    500mL in | 1 | bottle
  4.  Growth media (for pellet resuspension):    50mL in | 1  | tubes 
  5.  Time that all aliquots were placed in the water bath to warm before use:   11:30 

Note: if aliquots were placed in water bath at different times, record the
time stamp for each individual solution.




2\. Washed the flask(s) with dPBS.

3\. Added |500|mL tryple to each vessel/well and incubated at 37ºC for 13 min

4\. Neutralised with | 500mL | dPBS (warmed) and combined cell suspension into
a | 20x 50mL | tubes.

5\. Centrifuged at 650 x g for 5 min

  1.  Start/Finish time for centrifugation was:   12:23 - 12:28 a/pm (library lab)  

  2. Start/Finish time for centrifugation was:   12:23 - 12:28 a/pm (main lab)  




6\. Aspirated the supernatant(s).

7\. Resuspend pellet(s) in | 52 |mL | growth | media.

8\. Performed a cell count using the haemocytometer and recorded the cell
count data in the Google Doc spreadsheet called 'Cell Count Spreadsheet' (see
link below):

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1DPzKubYxfHmWogVPihC-
SSIBtIylyrBQE5kRX5Z8NtI/edit#gid=0

9\. Total cell number was: | 70.2M |

10\. Calculate the required volume cell suspension & freeze medium to generate
a concentration of

-2M/mL- 10x 20M cells =20M cells, 52/7 *2= 14.8mL  
-5M/mL- 52-14.8= 37.2mL

  




11\. Prepared   20mL Freeze Medium: (FBS + 10% DMSO).

Stored at 4ºC until use to keep chilled.

12\. Centrifuged cells at 650 x g for 5 min. 13:00

Whilst centrifuge is spinning, prepared & printed vial labels, labelled
cryovials. (Note that passage number will be the same as the culture you
harvest from. The passage number will increase by 1 during the revive of a
vial.)




13\. Aspirated supernatant carefully, taking care not to disturb the pellet.

14\. Resuspended the pellet in |  10 |mL freeze media (chilled, to reduce DMSO
toxicity).

15\. Aliquotted 1MLinto |  10 | x cryovials (already labelled) (10x vials for
each density)

16\. Tightened the lids & transfer the cryovials to a Mr. Frosty immediately
into the -80ºC freezer.   13:20

  * [ ]  Without foam
  * [ ]  1st Freeze
  * [ ]  2nd Freeze

  * [x ]  4th Freeze

17\. Allow the cells to freeze for at least 18-24 hours before transferring to
Liquid Nitrogen storage.




Observations/Summary:  
During the process of transferring typsilised cells to centrifuge tubes, about
1/4 of the cells were spilled and were therefore lost.
