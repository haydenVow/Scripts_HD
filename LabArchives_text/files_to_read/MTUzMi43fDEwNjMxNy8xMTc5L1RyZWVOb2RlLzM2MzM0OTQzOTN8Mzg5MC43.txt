Process:

1\. Removed plate culture IDs: 6810-DOLLY12, MOCHA-Sheep P10/2-1of1 containing
scaffolds from the incubator.

2\. Wash the wells in the 96 well plate 2x in   200  uL of PBS for  5  minutes
at room temperature.

  1. 11:00 - 11:05   

  2. 11:07 - 11:12




3\. Added 150 uL of 4% PFA to each scaffold and incubate for  15  min at room
temperature.  11:17 - 11:32  




4\. Wash the pieces 2 times for   5    minutes in   1  mL of PBS.

  1. 11:35 - 11:40   

  2. 11:43 - 11:48

5\. Aspirate the PBS and leave the scaffold pieces just covered by fresh PBS.

Observations:

\- Some conditions in the wells formed clumps together (like aggregates) or a
thin sheet after finishing the fix with 4% PFA.

\- Most scaffolds had broken up since being placed in the 96-well plates from
the day before.

\- Too many fibroblasts were seeded onto the zein scaffolds with most cells
adhereing to the well bottom- may make it difficult to determine if cells are
adhered to scaffolds following the anitibody staining and imaging.

  




# Results:

[x]  As Usual (this is a repetitive task)

[]  Unexpected because...

[]  Need to be further analysed

[]  Other (.......)
