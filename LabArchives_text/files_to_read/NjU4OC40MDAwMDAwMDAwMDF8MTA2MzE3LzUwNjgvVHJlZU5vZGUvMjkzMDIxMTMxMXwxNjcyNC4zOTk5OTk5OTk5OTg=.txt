### Process:

1\. Took image of vessel with microscope on phase setting. Include link in
image section

2\. Gelatin coated     4     x     2 CF      &     4     x     24wp     vessel
with sterile filtered 0.1% gelatin solution and then incubated all coated
flasks at 37˚C.

  1. Time when all vessels(s) placed into the incubator       :   pm 

3\. Aliquotted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then
placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath for a minimum of 20 minutes
prior to use:

  1. TrypLE:    2 X 30     mL in 2 x 50 ml falcon tubes  

  2.  dPBS (At 37 degrees for washing):     2 x 30    mL 
  3.  dPBS (at RT neutralising):    2 x 30   mL 
  4. Growth media (for pellet resuspension):     6    mL 
  5. Growth media (for seeding):     2 x 300 ml    mL

Time that all aliquots were placed in the water bath the warm before use
14:38  pm

Note: if aliquots were placed in water bath at different time, record the time
stamp for each individual solution.




4\. Removed vessel(s) from the incubator     15:24  pm

5\. Washed the vessel(s) with dPBS (warmed).

6\. Added     10    mL tryple to each vessel/well and incubated at 37˚C.

  1. Start/Finish for TrypLE was     15:45-16:00  pm 

7\. Neutralised with     10     dPBS and combined cell suspension into a    2
x 50 ml  tube.

8\. Centrifuged at 650 x g for 5 min.

  1. Start/Finish time for centrifugation was     16:20-16:25 pm 




9\. Aspirated the supernatant(s).

10\. Resuspended pellet(s) in     2.4 ml (Daisy)    mL    growth media + p38i
media     16:26 pm

11\. Aliquoted     10 uL     of resuspended cells into a microcentrifuge tube
for cell count.

12\. Performed a cell count using the haemocytometer and recorded counts in
"Seed Calculator" widget (see below):

13\. Transferred        ABOVE VOLUMS    of cell suspension to the pre-warmed
Growth media:  

14\. Transferred cell suspension into the       2 X 24 WP AND 2 X 2CF     for
each cell line.  

15\. Left at RT in the BSC for 30 min to allow cells to settle      17:18  \-
17:48 pm

 Left at RT in the BSC for 30 min to allow cells to settle      17:45  \-
18:05 pm  

16\. Transferred vessel(s) to incubate at:

  * [x]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)  Incubator:     18:05        

  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (avian cells)
