### Process:

1\. Took image of vessel with microscope on phase setting.

3\. Aliquotted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then
placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath for a minimum of 20 minutes
prior to use:

  1. TrypLE:     60    mL in     1    tubes
  2.  dPBS (for washing and neutralising):      60   mL in   2 (30mL each)     tubes
  3. Growth media (for pellet resuspension):     5    mL in      1   tubes
  4. Growth media (for seeding):    10mL per condition     mL in    6  tubes

Time that all aliquots were placed in the water bath the warm before use
3:52 pm

Note: if aliquots were placed in water bath at different time, record the time
stamp for each individual solution.




4\. Removed vessel(s) from the incubator   16:10 pm

5\. Washed the vessel(s) with dPBS (warmed). (10mL/flask)

6\. Added    10   mL tryple to each vessel/well and incubated at 37˚C.

  1. Start/Finish for TrypLE was   16:14 - 16:26  pm 

7\. Neutralised with   10mL/flask   dPBS and combined cell suspension into a
3 x 50mL  tubes.

8\. Centrifuged at 650 x g for 5 min.

  1. Start/Finish time for centrifugation was   16:35 - 16:40  pm 




9\. Aspirated the supernatant(s).

10\. Resuspended pellet(s) in    5   mL    Growth    media     :   a/pm

11\. Aliquoted     10uL     of resuspended cells into a microcentrifuge tube
for cell count.

Diluted 1:5 with 40uL trypan blue.

12\. Performed a cell count using the haemocytometer and recorded the cell
count data in the Google Doc spreadsheet called 'Cell Count Spreadsheet' (see
link below):

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1DPzKubYxfHmWogVPihC-
SSIBtIylyrBQE5kRX5Z8NtI/edit#gid=0

  1.  Total cell number was:      37M       

  2. Volume of cell suspension required for subculture was:       1.2mL each     

  3. Cell density per vessel:     8.5M cells / vessel  (10mL total)       




1.2mL x 4 aliquots made and centrifuged at 650 x g for 5 min at RT 5:20-5:22pm

Aspirated supernatant from each pellet

Resuspended each pellet in respective pre-warmed growth media and transferred
into the 50mL vented-cap tube.

Transferred the 50mL shake tubes to shake at 206 RPM at 37C, 5% CO2. 17:32 pm

14\. Transferred remaining cell suspension into the   60mL of warm growth
media into 2 x T175 flasks     vessel. 17:40 pm  

16\. Transferred vessel(s) to incubate at:

  * [ X]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (avian cells)

Observations/Summary:

\- 4 x 50mL shake tubes seeded with 8.5M cells each (DOLLY12 fibroblasts) in
various media compositions with Anti-clumping agent (1:100 and 1:500) and
RevitaCell (1:100)




### Results:

  * Results were;
    * [ ]  As Usual (this is a repetitive task)
    * [ ]  Unexpected because...
    * [x ]  Need to be further analysed as this is the first time 50mL shake tubes have been used for suspension culture of fibroblasts at Vow
    * [ ]  Other (.......)
