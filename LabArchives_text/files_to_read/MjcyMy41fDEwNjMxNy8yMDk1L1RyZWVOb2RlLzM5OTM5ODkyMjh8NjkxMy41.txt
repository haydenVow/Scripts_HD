Process:

2 x 1 ml media aliquots in 15 ml falcon tubes stored in fridge 104 library
lab. Labelled 'SUN' on lid and labelled 'JARED' and 'EPIC16074' on side.

1\. Aliquotted   0.5 mL  mL of E6 media into   1 x 15mL   tube and aliquotted
0.5 mL  mL of  HS media into   1 x 15mL tube. Stored in the fridge 104.

2\. Placed both tubes in water bath   7:40  

3\. Removed  100  % of Growth Media from vessel. 7:50

4\. Replaced with  150 uL (per well/per vessel) of  Diff   media.

5\. Returned vessel to incubate at  7:55

  * [X]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (aviary cells)
