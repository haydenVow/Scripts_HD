Protocol.

Prepare 1ml per well for 24well plates, and 100ul per well for 96 well plates.
Use Hoechst at 20ul/mL.

  

  1. Prewarmed PBS for 10 mins in water bath. 10:27 - 14:20
  2. Prepared Hoechst stain by adding 12 ul of Hoechst to 0.6 ml of PBS. 14:22
  3.  Retrieve N = 2 cell seeded and N=1 cell free Zein scaffolds from the 24w plate and N = 3 from the bioreactor and transfer to a new 24w plate  

  4. Covered these wells with 100 ul hoechst/media mix and incubate cells at 37°C for 10 minutes, protected from light. 14:42-14:52
  5. Removed Hoechst/media mix. 
  6. Wash with 2x with 200 ul PBS for 5 minutes. 14:58 - 15:03 , 15:03 - 15:08  
  

  7. Replaced PBS with fresh PBS for imaging. 
  8. Imaged both sides on Zabre microscope

MTT STAINING PROTOCOL

Reagent Preparation (Example dilution is 75 mg MTT in 15 mL Diluent - so 5mg
of MTT per mL)

  
  
  
  
ReagentMix/Stock/Aliquot NumberVolumes/Mass  
  
MTT

88430 mg  
  
DMEM16246 ml  
  
  
 Protocol:

  1. Aliquotted 6 ml of DMEM media and placed in water bath , 10:10
  2.  Retrieve N = 1 alginate from bioreactor and N = 1 alginate from the 6 well plate and N = 1 cell seeded zein from the 24 well plate
  3. Weighed out 30 mg of MTT (Stock #884) into a falcon tube then add  6 ml of the pre-warmed DMEM.  
  4. Pipetted up and down until re-suspended. Yellow colour should form. Cover tube with foil.
  5. Removed the vessels containing the alginate samples from the incubator
  6. Using a sterile spatula, transferred samples to new wells of a 24-well plate
  7. Covered each sample with 1.5 ml per well of the MTT DMEM PRF media. 
  8. Protected the plate from light using foil and placed in the incubator for 1h (37ºC, 5% CO2). 11:00 - 12:00
  9. Replaced media with PBS for better visibility of the sample colour.
  10. Took pictures of the samples in the MTT plate using a phone/camera and attach below.  12:14
  11. Imaged samples down the microscope (phase), 3 images per sample. Upload images below. 12:44

Note - purple coloration indicates live cells - samples which remain yellow
suggest no cells or dead cells

General observations:

All samples showed a black stain with good cell coverage. More cell coverage
on one side of the zein than the other.
