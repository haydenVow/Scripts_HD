About alamarBlue cell viability assay


AlamarBlue Cell Viability Reagent is a ready-to-use resazurin-based solution
that functions as a cell health indicator by using the reducing power of
living cells to quantitatively measure viability. Resazurin, the active
ingredient of alamarBlue reagent, is a non-toxic, cell-permeable compound that
is blue in color and virtually non-fluorescent. Upon entering living cells,
resazurin is reduced to resorufin, a compound that is red in color and highly
fluorescent. Changes in viability can be easily detected using either an
absorbance- or fluorescence-based plate reader. alamarBlue Cell Viability
Reagent has broad applicability and can be used with various human and animal
cell lines, bacteria, plant, and fungi.


Suitability for our purposes


We want to use alamarBlue to determine cell confluence in SCC plates to
generate data for clone picking. This means that the assay needs to be very
sensitive (ideally down to ~20 cells). AlamarBlue is reported to be sensitive
enough to pick up 50 cells in one well, however for this sensitivity it may
require longer incubation times (i.e. 24 hours). The assay is also far more
sensitive when used with a fluorescence plate reader, however our in-house
plate reader does not have fluorescence capabilities.

To test this assay, adherent CHOMP cells will be plated using a serial
dilution (n=6 reps) and read on the plate reader at hours 1 and 4. The plate
will again be read on days 1,5,7,9,12,14 and16 to see how the reagents tracks
cell confluence over time when left in the medium.
