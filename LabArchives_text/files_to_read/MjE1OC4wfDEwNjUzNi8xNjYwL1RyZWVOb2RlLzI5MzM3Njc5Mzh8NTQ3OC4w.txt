Procedure




Observation: cell suspension was very clumpy. Small circular aggregates can be
observed in flasks.  
  
Cells barely grew since yesterday so decided to spin down and feed these cells
with fresh media to help them grow.  
Media used: A12784  
IGF used: A12212  
EGF Used: A12215  
  
Cells spun down at 500g for 5min  
supernatant removed and cells re-suspended in new media  
all cells combined into 1x1L bottle with fresh media and this was divided
across 2x new E2000 flasks
