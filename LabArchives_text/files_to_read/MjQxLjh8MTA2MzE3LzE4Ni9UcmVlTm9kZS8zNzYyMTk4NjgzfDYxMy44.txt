Image scaffolds for cell seeding on both sides of scaffolds - write
observations on cell coverage

  

Reagent Preparation:

ReagentMix/Stock/Aliquot Number  
  
Growth Media - DMEM/F12 + 20% FBS + 1 X P/S + p38i

This test was done in parallel with entry EPIC16060: Hoechst survival test
experiment D1 16/4/21 Hoechst and Dapi staining of Zein Scaffolds + culture
plates. Protocol written by BT.

Hoechst staining protocol.

Trial staining was first performed on N=1 scaffold (seeded by JB on 15/04/21)-
Non sterile

  

1\. N=1 scaffold (seeded by JB on 15/04/21) #6403 was transferred to a new 96
well plate.  

2\. 5ul of Hoechst stain was added to 245ul of growth media.  

3\. Scaffold covered with 100ul/well of Hoechst/media mix and incubated cells
at 37°C for 10 minutes, protected from light. 13:20-13:30

4\. Wash with 2x with 200ul PBS for 5 minutes. 13:32, 13:37  
5\. Imaged.  

  

After successful trial staining, Hoechst staining was performed on more
scaffolds.

  

Note: For continual live cell perform all staining in the BSC.

  

This staining was to be done on the bench so N=2 seeded scaffolds were removed
from 6404 and N=2 seeded scaffolds were removed from 6402.

  

  

  

Prepare 1ml per well for 24well plates, and 100ul per well for 96 well plates.
Use Hoechst at 20ul/mL.

  

  1. Prepared Hoechst stain by adding 600 ul of Hoechst to 3ml of growth media. 16:00  
  

  2. Hoeschst/media mix was sterilised using a syringe filter. 
  3. Media was removed from N=3 cell seeded scaffolds and N=4 cell free scaffolds in plate 6403 as well N=3 seeded scaffolds on plate 6402  

  4. Covered these wells with 100ul hoechst/media mix and incubate cells at 37°C for 10 minutes, protected from light. 17:27
  5. Removed hoechst/media mix. 
  6. Wash with 2x with 200ul PBS for 5 minutes.
  7. Replaced PBS with fresh growth media for imaging. 
  8. Imaged. 
  9. After imaging returned to plates incubate at 37°C and 5% CO2.

Imaging

Note in observations:

\- Topography

\- Coverage more or less

\- One side more seeded than the other

  

Seeding TypeDry or wet?Number of SamplesPoked or not poked during
drying?Handing NotesImage notes  
SuspensionDry2PokeStuck to base. One sample able to be pulled off in one piece
but difficult. One sample not able to get off the bottom of the well and
torn.Topography looks drier, with more cracks and sharper edges. Looks like
possibly more cell coverage than wet. More coverage on the one side with more
rough looking topography than the other flatter side.Cells appear to cluster
in the cracks of the scaffold.  
  
  
SuspensionWet1PokeEasy to handle.Better coverage of cells on one side than the
other flatter-looking side. Sample not transferred to a new well before
imaging like the rest.  
  
  
Flipped and Seeded Both SidesDry2PokeNot stuck as much and easier to handle
than suspension dry but more difficult to handle than wet.Topography looks
drier, with more cracks and sharper edges. Looks like possibly more cell
coverage than wet. Good cell coverage on both sides. Cells appear to cluster
in the cracks of the scaffold.  
  
  
Flipped and Seeded Both SidesWet1PokeEasy to handle.Good coverage of cells on
both sides. Sample not transferred to a new well before imaging like the rest
so some cells present on the bottom of the plate.

General observations:  
Dryer samples seemed to have more cell coverage but also looked drier, with
cracks and sharper edges. It looked like it would be more crumbly but still
handled well. Many samples had a 'flat' side which seemed to possibly have
less cells.

Ella's observations/summary:  
  
\- wet samples are easier to handle and do not stick to the base of the wells

\- dry samples more likely to stick to base of well and become more difficult
to handle, especially when seeded by suspension

\- no obvious advantage at this timepoint for drying over seeding of wet
samples

\- to me it looked like the wet samples which were seeded on both sides had
the best cell coverage

\- drying had an effect on surface topography (more cracked and crispy) which
was not recovered by time in media post drying  
\- It will be interesting to see if the drying conditions and/or the seeding
conditions demonstrate any advantageous or disadvanatageous effect on cell
adhesion maintenance in E6 at the D7 diff timepoint (Friday)
