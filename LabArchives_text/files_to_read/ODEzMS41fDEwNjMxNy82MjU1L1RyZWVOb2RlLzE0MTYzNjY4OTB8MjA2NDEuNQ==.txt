24-01-22D0Harvest CHOMP fibroblasts & CHO-S cells Harvesting CHO-S cells from
Adrian's culture  
24-01-22D0 FACS sort into 5 x 384-well plates (4 x CHOMP, 1 x CHO-S):

  1. Prepare 5 x plates with fresh growth medium 
    1. CHOMP: HyCell CHO + 20% KSR + 1% Glutamax + 1xP/S 
    2. CHO-S: HyCell CHO + 1% Glutamax + 1xP/S
  2. Prepare 20 mL FACS Buffer
  3. Harvest fibroblasts from T175s
  4. Harvest CHO-S from Adrian's E-flask
  5. Take to Garvan and sort (1-4pm) 
  6. Transport plates back to Vowse, place in incubator
