## Observations after extra proliferation time:

The flasks are slightly more confluent, but cell coverage remains a bit
patchy/zonal within each flask and overall confluence is still below our
desired 70% minimum level to progress them to the next stage (E6
Differentiation).

## Next steps:

We will leave the flasks to proliferate for a further 24h and monitor for
confluence after that. Hopefully they will be at the desired 70% level to
initiate E6 treatment.
