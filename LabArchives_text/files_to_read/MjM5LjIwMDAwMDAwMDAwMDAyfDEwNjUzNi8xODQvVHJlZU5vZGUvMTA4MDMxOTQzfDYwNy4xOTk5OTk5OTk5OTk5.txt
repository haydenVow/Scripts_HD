Experimental Plan:

[DAY 1] - Seed 4 x 96 well plates with 2240 cells/well in 140 uL/well

  1. Thaw 1 WCB of F-DOLLY12 and seed 4x96 well-plates with 4 conditions columns (6 wells per column):  
i. commerical DMEM/F12 + 10% FBS + P/S  
ii. in house lot 1 + 10% FBS + P/S  
iii. in house lot 2 + 10% FBS + P/S  
iv. freeze thawed commercial DMEM/F12  \+ 10% FBS + 1% P/S

  2. Label 4x 96 well plates as a designated time point: 24 h, 48 h, 72 h, and 96 h.
  3. Place plates in the incubator.

Note: dPBS in every well around the plate.

[Day 2] - 24 hours later, fix and DAPI stain one plate. On the remaining 3
plates, do a 50% media change.  

  1. Use an OT2 protocol to fix & dapi, as well as to perform the 100% media change.

[Day 3] \- Fix and DAPI stain 48 h plate using the Opentrons? and image with
Zaber using MIA capture

[Day 4] - Fix and DAPI stain 72 h plate using the Opentrons? and image with
Zaber using MIA capture

[Day 5] \- Fix and DAPI stain 96h plate using the Opentrons? and image with
Zaber using MIA capture

  

[Day 6] - Analysis of images

In order to process data from this assay we must:

  1. Process images using https://vowfood.retool.com/apps/Mia
  2. Copy each time point of each condition into Prism
  3. Create proliferation graph for each condition
  4. Identify doubling time for each condition
  5. Add graphs and doubling time on Notion

Acceptance criteria:

  * Proliferation graphs created for each condition
  * Doubling time for each condition
