Growth Media:

  

  * [ x]  DMEM/F12 + 20% FBS + 1X P/S + P38i (10uM_

Total media required: 750mL




Reagent preperation

1\. Aliquotted   750mL  mL of  GROWTH Media into  1X750mL     tube(s). Placed
in water bath   09:56 am




Cell factory Process

  1. Unscrew white cap and remove blue cap and place aside.
  2. Removed  `50`  % of supernatant (750 mL) from 1 x 10CS by carefully pouring into a waste container with 300mL marked.
  3. Replaced with  750 mL (per flask) of  `growth`   media by carefully pouring media through the white cap opening (alternatively you may use a 50mL serological to add media.)
  4. Place caps back and equalise 10CF by placing it on its side (blue cap on the bottom and white cap on the top, see image below:)  
  

4\. Returned vessel to incubate at: 10:35am

  * [ x ]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (aviary cells)
