Protocol run:

6 well plates with growth media warmed in incubator: 12:42 - 13:35

Plate/s taken out from incubator: 13:35

first run started at: 13:42. The OT2 wasn't aspirating media from the 24 well
plate. The run was stopped. I checked the calibration again - in case the tip
was calibration too high to reach the media in the well. It seems like this
was not the case. Well A1 will therefore have a longer tryple time than rest
of the wells.  

second run started: 1:51:09 PM. I watched well C1 on the first step. Growth
media did get aspirated, but because the well is larger, the dead volume must
be larger so a lot the media still gets left behind. Guessing ~50% left
behind. However, it does get diluted out with PBS wash.  

Run time: 1:09:37  

Plate/s returned to incubator: ~16:00

Observations/Summary:

most cells were still attached to their origin wells and did not get passaged.
the dead volume remaining in the 24 wp was: approx 160 - 460uL
