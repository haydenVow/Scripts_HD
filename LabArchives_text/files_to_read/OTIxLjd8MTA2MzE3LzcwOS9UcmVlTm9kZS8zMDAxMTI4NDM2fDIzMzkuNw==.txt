  1. Prepare the following reagents:
    * ~`65mL"DMEM/F12"`
      * `32.5 mL` DMEM
      * `32.5 mL`  F12
      * `0.130 mL` pen/strep
      * `35.3 mg` sodium bicarb
      * filter sterilise
  2. Any reconstitution buffers identified in this experiment's pipeline calculator
  3. Prepare working stocks of each factor
    1. Refer to the "Factor Calcs" tab of your pipeline calculator to find uL amounts of `"DMEM/F12"` and concentrated stock needed to create a working stock for each factor.
    2. Label one 96 Deep Well Plate as "Stock Plate", and add the uL amount of `"DMEM/F12"`for each factor in the following arrangement:
      1. Factor 1 through 8- A1 through H1
      2. Factor 9 through 16- A2 through H2
    3. Next, add the uL amount of `concentrated stock` for each factor to the stock plate using the same arrangement as above.
  4. Seal plate with adhesive plate seal and store in the fridge (4 degrees C).

Observations/Summary:

Made working stocks of 16 factors according to linked excel sheet.

B-27 supplement stock is a yellow colour, it's working stock is also yellow
(as opposed to pink for the other working stocks). It's possible once it's
diluted to make the conditions it will be fine.

There was only 100uL of BMP2 (instead of the planned 115.2uL) so 15.2 uL of
"DMEM/F12" was added to that well to make up the difference.

A drop of the pluronic 188 went into well containing CNTF working stock.

While pipetting concentrated stock of vitronectin into the DWP, the tip fell
off into the adjacent well (which contained DMEM/F12 and was designated to be
the well for P188). I reattached the tip and added to the correct well. It
didn't look like any of it had gone flowed out of the tip while it had fallen
into the wrong well but noting it here just in case.
