Preparation (Day Before Harvest) - Prepared by LL 28/06/21


Growth Media:

  * [x]  DMEM/F12 + 20% FBS + 1X P/S + P38i (10uM)
  * [ ]  DMEM/F12 + 20% FBS + 1X P/S + 25ng/mL FGF-basic + P38i (10uM)

  




  

  




## Prepare Taipans

Ensure enough Taipans are autoclaved for use before starting passage (at least
one per E-Flask to passage). These are generally kept in the bioprocess area
near the Biostat bioreactor.




## Equilibrate microcarriers in culture medium before use (E250 for PLanar
Derived Culture)

  1. Prior to use, aliquoted  13.5  mL of sterilized microcarriers ( 20  g/L stock) suspended in dPBS into  1  x  E250  flasks.
  2. Rinsed microcarriers in  13.5  mL culture medium (50 mL/g Cytodex). (this rinse reduces dilution of the culture medium by PBS trapped between and within the microcarriers, which is particularly important when using small culture volumes or cells with low plating efficiencies).
  3. The microcarriers were then allowed to settle and as much supernatant as possible was removed.
  4. The microcarriers were resuspended to the desired volume of culture medium (  60  mL ) in each vessel.
  5. The culture vessel was transferred to the incubator ~~for at least 1 hour or~~  overnight so that the microcarriers and culture medium could equilibrate.  15:14    

    * 37 degrees, 5% CO2, Incubator #  67 




## Equilibrate microcarriers in culture medium before use (E125 for
Microcarrier Derived Culture)

  1. Prior to use, aliquoted  6.75  mL of sterilized microcarriers ( 20  g/L stock) suspended in dPBS into  1  x  E125  flasks.
  2. Rinsed microcarriers in  6.75  mL culture medium (50 mL/g Cytodex). (this rinse reduces dilution of the culture medium by PBS trapped between and within the microcarriers, which is particularly important when using small culture volumes or cells with low plating efficiencies).
  3. The microcarriers were then allowed to settle and as much supernatant as possible was removed.
  4. The microcarriers were resuspended to the desired volume of culture medium (  30  mL ) in each vessel.
  5. The culture vessel was transferred to the incubator ~~for at least 1 hour or~~  overnight so that the microcarriers and culture medium could equilibrate.  15:14

  2. Allow the microcarriers to settle for at least 2 minutes   13:12  

  3. Gently tilt the flask to an angle of approximately 30 degrees from vertical
  4. Remove the cap and aspirate the supernatant using a serological pipet - keep the tip only 5-10 mm below the surface during this procedure
  5. Transfer half of the fresh, pre-warmed dPBS (15mL) for E125 and (30mL) for E250 for prewashing to the flask using a serological pipet - wash down the insides to wash any stuck microcarriers back into the bulk suspension, then replace the cap

  




## Second wash to remove serum:

  1. Allow the microcarriers to settle for at least 2 minutes   13:20   

  2. Gently tilt the flask to an angle of approximately 30 degrees from vertical
  3. Remove the cap and aspirate the supernatant using a serological pipet - keep the tip only 5-10 mm below the surface during this procedure
  4. Transfer the remaining half of the fresh, pre-warmed dPBS for prewashing to the flask using a serological pipet - wash down the insides to wash any stuck microcarriers back into the bulk suspension, then replace the cap

  




## Add detachment agent:

  1. Allow the microcarriers to settle for at least 2 minutes   13:27   

  2. Gently tilt the flask to an angle of approximately 30 degrees from vertical
  3. Remove the cap and aspirate the supernatant using a serological pipet - keep the tip only 5-10 mm below the surface during this procedure
  4. Transfer the fresh, pre-warmed Trypsin/EDTA/Poloxomer 188 solution to the flask using a serological pipet - wash down the insides to wash any stuck microcarriers back into the bulk suspension, then replace the cap.

  




## Incubate flask:

  1. Stop the shaker
  2. Remove the flask from the BSC and transfer it back to the shaker
  3. Restart the shaker at the speed   210  rpm  see the table below.   13:32 (E125) 13:35 (E250)  

  4. After `  15  `minutes, stop the shaker
  5. Remove the flask from the shaker   13:47 (E125) 13:50 (E250)  

  6. Cells were sampled (100uL) at the 15 minute mark, and observed under the microscope in a 24WP well with addition of dPBS.

## Neutralize the detachment reagent:

  1. Added   30 mL (E125) and  60 mL (E250) of fresh, pre-warmed growth medium containing 1% w/v poloxomer 188 to the flask.
  2. Mixed the suspensions using a P10 serological pipette multiple times.
  3. Allow the microcarriers to settle for at least 2 minutes
  4. Gently tilted the flask to an angle of approximately 30 degrees from vertical
  5. An autoclaved Taipan was used to recover the cells into a 50mL syringe for each flask.

  




## Recover Cells

Used Taipan V1 to remove the cell suspension into two 50 mL tubes.




## First wash to recover additional cells:

  1. Transfer half of the fresh, pre-warmed dPBS solution to the flask using a serological pipet - wash down the insides to wash any stuck microcarriers back into the bulk suspension

## Second wash to recover additional cells:

  1. Repeated the first wash procedure (steps 1-6 above) once more with fresh dPBS with/without poloxomer.
  2. 10mL of fresh dPBS was added to each harvested E flask to resuspend microcarriers. 

  




#  ~~~~Optional: sieve cell suspension to remove microcarriers

  1. Pass the cell suspension through a 40 - 100 um pore-size sieve to remove any errant microcarriers. ~~~~




## Recover pellet, prepare suspension for counting and subculture:

  1. Centrifuged all supernatant tubes at 650 - 700 RCF for 5 minutes.   14:30 (E250) , 14:37 (E125)  

  2. Tubes from E125 centrifuged again because they were bumped/knocked 14:50
  3. Aspirated supernatant from each tube.
  4. Resuspended pellets in each tube in 1 mL of fresh, pre-warmed growth medium in each tube.
  5. Cell resuspensions for each flask were combined into one respective 50mL tube for counting. 
  6. Washed out empty tubes with 400-500uL of remainder of the fresh, pre-warmed growth medium and combine with the cell suspension for their respective flasks

  


Cell Count and Seeding


## Performed Cell Count:

  1. Aliquoted    10uL      of resuspended cells into a microcentrifuge tube for cell count.
  2. Performed a cell count using the haemocytometer and recorded the cell count data in the Google Doc spreadsheet called 'Cell Count Spreadsheet' (see link below):
  3. https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1DPzKubYxfHmWogVPihC-SSIBtIylyrBQE5kRX5Z8NtI/edit#gid=0&range=1043:1046

  1. Total average cell number for 7233 was:   520k cells    

  2. Total average cell number for 7234 was:  408k cells     

##  
Ki67 Assay Seeding:

  1. Aliquoted 1.5 mL of growth media to one 15mL tubes (minus the volume of cell suspension to be added) 
  2. Added 0.75 uL of p38i to the tube.
  3. To one tube,   30  uL (approximately 5,700 cells) of cell suspension from 7233 was added.
  4. To one tube,   60  uL (approximately 5,700 cells) of cell suspension from 7234 was added.
  5. The cell suspension was distributed across 3 wells on 1 x 24 well plate (B2-4)
  6. Cell density per vessel:     1900 cells/well     with 500 uL per well.  

  7. Transferred 1 x seeded 24 well plate to incubator   15:50 ~~ ~~~~~~  

  8. Repeat for the other E-Flask cell suspension. ~~~~

##  
T75 Seeding:

  1. 2x T75 flasks were gelatin coated and put in the incubator 15:45
  2. T75 flasks removed from incubator 17:00
  3. T75 flasks seeded with  300 uL from 7233 and  750uL from 7234 (approximately 75k cells)
  4. The flasks were 'bec dropped' and left in the bsc for 30 min 17:30
  5. Both T75 flasks placed back into the incubator  18:00

Not enough cells for E flask seeding. 50 ml falcon tubes seeded instead.

  1.  ~~The E250 flask was removed from the incubator and placed in the BSC    time   
~~

  2. ~~This flask to be seeded was labelled 'planar derived'.~~
  3.  ~~The remaining cells counted from the flask were added to this E250 flask.~~
  4.  ~~This flask was placed in the bottom incubator in the library lab (incubator #68). Shaking at 110rpm continuously.   time ~~

  4.  ~~This flask was placed in the bottom incubator in the library lab (incubator #68). Shaking at 110rpm continuously.  ~~ ~~ ~~  time ~~~~

## 50 mL Falcon Tube Seeding:

  1. The E125 flask was removed from the incubator and placed in the BSC   17:30   

  2. Instead of 135 mg Cytodex 1 in 30 mL in E125, you can do 45 mg Cytodex 1 in 10 mL in 50 mL bioreactor tube. So, you can seed with 1/3 the number of cells (~600k)
  3. 2x 10 mL was removed from the E125 and added to 2x 50 mL falcon tubes labelled 'microcarrier derived' and 'planar derived'.
