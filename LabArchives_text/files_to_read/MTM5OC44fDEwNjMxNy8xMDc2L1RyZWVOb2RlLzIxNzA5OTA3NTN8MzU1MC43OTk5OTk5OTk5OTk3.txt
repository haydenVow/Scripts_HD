Process:

1\. Aliquotted   62mL  mL of  growth Media into  1x50mL     tube(s). Placed in
water bath   12:26 a/pm

1a. Removed flasks from the incubator and imaged each under the 4x objective
on the primovert. images were captured of each flask (n=3)

2\. Removed  50  % of supernatant from vessel.

3\. Replaced with  30 mL (per well/per vessel) of   growth  media.

4\. Returned vessel to incubate at: 12:54

  * [x]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (aviary cells)

  

  * Incubator (#67  ), Lab [Library]




### Observations/Summary:

  * Cell morphology: cells appear very small and thin. 
  * Confluence was around 10%.
