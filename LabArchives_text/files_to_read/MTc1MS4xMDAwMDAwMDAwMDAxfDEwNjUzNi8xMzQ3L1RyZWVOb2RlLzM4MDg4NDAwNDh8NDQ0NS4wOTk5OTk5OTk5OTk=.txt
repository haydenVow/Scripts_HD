Batch Objectives/Outline:

  * Produce as much mass as possible for investor tastings

Batch Timeline (Proliferation days in each passage & Flask no./type):

Passage NumberProliferation daysFlask No./Type

P2711x10CF and 1x4CF  
P39 - 1433x10CCS and 2x5CS  
  
  

Notable Events:

  * All flasks started peeling a week and a half early and were harvest 1 week before the expected harvest date
    * Cell sheets began to peel off during the P3 Day 7 feed. Just the sheer forces of feeding the flasks were making the sheet peel off
    * The only other time this has been seen was in our first CHOMP batch when flasks were treated with only VitC (our best treatment with DOLLY). Therefore the suggested reasoning for this early peeling is likely to be the filtering of TGFb.
      * TGFb was being filtered before use due to contamination concerns. This was likely removing TGFb from the solvent and resulting in a lower concentration of the growth factor being used in cultures and therefore resulting in the CHOMP cells peeling early
