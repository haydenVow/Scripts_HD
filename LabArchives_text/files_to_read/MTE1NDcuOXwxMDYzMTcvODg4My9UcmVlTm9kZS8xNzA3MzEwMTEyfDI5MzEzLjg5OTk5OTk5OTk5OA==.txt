Methods and Experiment Layout


Experiment layout

We will attempt to seed four tissue discs. Each disc will be a single
replicate (condition). Conditions will be as follows:

  1. 20 million cells per mL, 20mL tissue gel
  2. 20 million cells per mL, 25mL tisue gel
  3. 40 million cells per mL, 20mL tissue gel
  4. 40 million cells per mL, 25mL tisue gel

  

Figure 1. Plate Map for Tissue Discs Experiment A. There are 4 conditions in
the same concentration of Collagen Type 1 (20 million cells per mL in 20mL of
tissue gel (for disc #1) and 25mL of tissue gel (for disc #2), then 40 million
cells per mL in 20mL of tissue gel (for disc #3) and 25mL of tissue gel (for
disc #4))

    * Pipette   9  mL  per plate for 6 petri dishes and spin-coat.  (DONE) 
  * Ensure matrix reagents are made up fresh at required concentrations
  * Matrix reagents details for this experiment:
  * Make up matrix reagents:
    * Collagen I to 2.6mg/mL - stock is at 6.17mg/mL - dilution factor 1:2.4
      * need  36.54   mL total (make   38  mL)
    * Pluronic. Dilute Stock solution from 2.5% to 0.25%.. 
      * Make up   100mL 


Scaffold mounting, sterilisation and coating


  

  1. Place the moulds in a bath of EtOH overnight (day before experiment) (DONE)
  2. Dry the plates upside-down along the bevel of the BSC to allow aeration, (morning of experiment) for 30-60 minutes    9:15   am 
  3. UV irradiate for 60 minutes under the mobile UV (reptile) lamp - start     9:45   am
  4. Pre-coat with 0.25% Pluronic solution for 1 hour (to prevent adhesion), start    11 : 15 am   


Cell Supply Harvest and Matrix Formation for Seeding


## Preparation for Harvest

  1. Prepare 4 falcon tubes for cell harvest for 4 conditions of different cell densities (20M and 40M cells/mL) and 2 different seeding volumes (20mL and 25mL).
    1. Completed calculations can be found here
  2. Media preparation for harvest and seeding: 
    1. DMEM/F12 growth medium as above (table 1).

  4. Pour required volume of cell suspension into 500mL centrifuge tubes:
    * 2.7B cells in 1380mL
  5. Centrifuge at 650g for 5 minutes: start   13 : 40   
  6. Resuspend pellets in each centrifuge tubes in    6.0 mL   DMEM/F12 growth medium to account for pellet volume to make up to a total of 33ml
    * NOTE: With 6mL GM, pellet was too large (~14mL) - As such, cell density is slightly lower than the stated (~30M/ml and ~15M cells/ml)
    * NOTE: Resuspending the pellet is very thick and viscous.
  7. Add required volume of cells+media to 4 falcon tubes:
    1. 15M/ml and 20mL tissue disc 1 =     4.84 mL 
    2. 15M/ml and 25mL tissue disc 2 =     6.05 mL 
    3. 30M/ml and 20mL tissue disc 1 =     9.68 mL 
    4. 10M/ml and 20mL tissue disc 1 =     12.1 mL   
  8. Proceed to matrix additions below. 
    1. Bring out matrix additives from the fridge. 

## Matrix formation for scaffold seeding - 2 cell densities + 2 tissue gel
volumes

N.B. Repeat this gel formation for each falcon tube at the same time - i.e.
Add Collagen to all, then add DMEM to all etc. - BUT be sure to move quickly!
Refer to Figure 2 to visualise the workflow.

5\. Seed    20mL & 25mL    gel/matrix gently into scaffold ensuring good
distribution around pillars in the well.

6. Leave for    60-90    minutes to gel at 37°C - start time   14:32  

7\. Add     ~180L   Media to entire 15mL dish, ensure entire mould is covered.

8. Culture at 37°C overnight before checking.

workflow.

  




# Tips and Tricks for this protocol:

  * When pelleting cells, make sure they are completely dry
  * Flick pellet to dislodge before adding medium
  * Add Medium first to pellet to prevent clumping and cell death
  * Col1 is very viscous, pipette carefully - when adding 10x DMEM, it turns yellow
  * As soon as you add the NaOH, be quick as the Col starts to gel
  * Everything has to be exact, don't be tempted to add more cells than the volume stated if there are some left
  * Add cells slowly!
