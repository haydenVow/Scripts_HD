Process:

  1. Aliquotted  4 mL  mL of  E6 Media (store at 4C)
  2. Aliquotted  4 mL  mL of  2% HS Media (store at 4C)
  3. Aliquotted  4 mL  mL of  E6 Media (warm at 37C)
  4. Aliquotted  4 mL  mL of  2% HS Media (warm at 37C)
  5. Aliquotted  2 x 21 mL  mL of  E6 Media (warm at 37C)
  6. Placed in water bath   14:08 pm 
  7. Removed  100 % of supernatant from vessel (as per below plate maps).  

  8. Replaced with  0.2 mL (per well/per vessel) of  E6 or 2% HS Diff media. 
  9. Returned vessel to incubate at:   16:26 pm (Drying and pipetting experiment) 17:30 (DOLLY12 temperature experiment)

  * [ X]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (aviary cells)

  

  * Incubator (#118  ), Lab [Main]

For feeding the C2C12 plates, start with the first quadrant (allow wells to
dry for 10 seconds and harsh pipetting), followed by the second (allow wells
to dry for 10 seconds and gentle pipetting), the third (feed immediately and
harsh pipetting) and finally the fourth.




### Observations/Summary:

100 % media changed on vessel(s)

  1. In the C2C12 plates, I counted 10 down to 0 in the case of the dry treatment. In the case of the gentle pipetting, I made sure I dispensed media in 5 seconds, whereas in the harsh pipetting I dispensed the media in about 1 second. In rows F7, F8, F9 and F10 on plate 8819, I accidentally absorbed all the media and forgot to make sure there was a thin layer of film before feeding.
