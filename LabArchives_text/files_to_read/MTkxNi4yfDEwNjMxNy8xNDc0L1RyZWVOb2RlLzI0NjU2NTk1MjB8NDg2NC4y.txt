Process:

1\. Aliquotted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then
placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath for a minimum of 20 minutes
prior to use:

  1. TrypLE:    20   mL in   1x 15 mL    tube
  2. dPBS (for neutralising)    40   mL in    1x 50 mL   pot
  3. Growth media (for pellet resuspension):    2   mL in    4x 15 mL   tubes for each condition
  4. Growth media (for seeding):    12   mL in    4x 15 mL   tubes 
  5. Times that all aliquots were placed in the water bath to warm before use  11:40

Note: if aliquots were placed in water bath at different times, record the
time stamp for each individual solution.




2\. Washed the flask(s) with dPBS.

3\. Added    5   mL tryple to each vessel/well and incubated at 37˚C for    17
min.

Note: Fibroblasts typically require 15-18 minutes of incubation with tryple,
slightly longer than MuSCs.

  1. Start/Finish time for tryple was  11:55  -  12:12   

4\. Neutralised with    5 mL   dPBS (warmed) and combined cell suspension into
a    5x 15 mL   tube.

5\. Centrifuged at 650 x g for 5 min

  1. Start/Finish time for centrifugation was  12:18  -  12:23   




6\. Aspirated the supernatant(s)

7\. Resuspended pellet(s) in      2  mL    respective growth   media.

8\. Performed a cell count using the haemocytometer and recorded the cell
count data in the Google Doc spreadsheet called 'Cell Count Spreadsheet' (see
link below):

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1DPzKubYxfHmWogVPihC-
SSIBtIylyrBQE5kRX5Z8NtI/edit#gid=0

9\. Total cell number was

  1. Total cell number (serum control) was:    3,276,000  

  2.  Total cell number (E8) was:    24,000      

  3.  Total cell number (E8 10C) was:   160,000     

  4.  Total cell number (E8 + goodies) was:    88,000    




10\. Seeded ~7k cells per cm2 of the flasks/plates. Note that fibroblasts
prefer to be subcultured closely together.

11\. Volume of cell suspension required for subculture was:

  1. Serum control was:    0.32 mL 
  2. E8 was:    2 mL      

  3. E8 10C was:    2 mL     

  4. E8 + goodies was:    2 mL     

12\. Transfer   required amount of cell suspension to the pre-warmed   12 mL
Growth Media.

13\. Transfer cell suspension into (non-gelatin coated)     4x T75    flasks.

14\. Transfer flask/plate(s) to incubate at:

  * [x]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (aviary cells)
