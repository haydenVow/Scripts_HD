Figure 1: Total cell counts of DOLLY12 fibroblasts (mean ± SD) seeded in
DMEM/F12 or RPMI basal media supplemented with or without additives (i.e.
boost) across the duration of the culturing period.  Due to the high variance
in the data captured several error bars are not represented completely in the
figure. Each condition was performed in duplicate (n=2).

  

Figure 2: Dead cell counts of DOLLY12 fibroblasts (mean ± SD) seeded in
DMEM/F12 or RPMI basal media supplemented with or without additives (i.e.
boost) across the duration of the culturing period.  Due to the high variance
in the data captured several error bars are not represented completely in the
figure. Each condition was performed in duplicate (n=2).
