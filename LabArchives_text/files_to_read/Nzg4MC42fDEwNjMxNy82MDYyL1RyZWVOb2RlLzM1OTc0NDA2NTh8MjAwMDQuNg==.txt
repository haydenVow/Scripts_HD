Process:

1\. Imaged each plate on 10x magnification.

2\. Aliquotted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then
placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath for a minimum of 20 minutes
prior to use:

  1. Tryple:    100  mL 
  2. dPBS (for washing and neutralising)   100  mL in  
  3. Growth media (for seeding):   300 mL
  4. Times that all aliquots were placed in the water bath to warm before use   10:00am

Note: if aliquots were placed in water bath at different times, record the
time stamp for each individual solution.




  1.  Washed the flask(s) 2x with TRYPLE
  2. Added  5/3/2mL  for T75/T25/6-well respectively tryple to each vessel/well and
  3. Incubated at 37ËšC for   14:30-15:00pm (30 min) min, checking regularly under the microscope to see if cells have detached  (>90%)  

  4. Neutralised with dPBS (warmed) and transferred cell suspension into a   50mL   tube/ culture.
  5. Centrifuged at 650 x g for 5 min
  6. Aspirated the supernatant(s)\+ Resuspended pellet(s) in     2mL media  mL      growth  media
  7. Performed a cell count using the haemocytometer and recorded the cell count data in widget or the Google Doc spreadsheet called 'Cell Count Spreadsheet' (see link below):

8\. Volume of cell suspension required for subculture was (Seed at
7000-7500/cm):  

9\. Transfer  cell suspension to the pre-warmed Growth Media.

10\. Transfer cell suspension into  flasks/plates.

Walle06: 1x T175 + 1x T75 + 1x T25 @ 7818 cells/cm2

walle07: 2x T75 @ 6800 cells/cm2

walle09: 1x 6well @ 8421 cells/cm2

11\. Transfer flask/plate(s) to incubate at: 16:30pm




Observations/Summary:

Walle07 was probably passaged a little prematurely - confluence was only about
60-70% , therefore went back into 2x T75.

Walle09 also provided low cell count and went back into a 6-well plate.
