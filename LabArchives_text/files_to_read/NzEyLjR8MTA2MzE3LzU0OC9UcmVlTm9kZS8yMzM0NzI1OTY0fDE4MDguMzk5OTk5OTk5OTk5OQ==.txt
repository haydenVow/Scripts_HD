RELATED TO MILESTONE:  Demonstrate that co-culture improves sustained
adherence of MuSCs beyond monoculture.

AIM/PURPOSE: To determine whether the addition or absence of fibroblasts on
Zein scaffolds, and the addition or absence of Vitamin C will assist in the
prolonged adhesion of MuSCs onto the Zein scaffolds throughout
differentiation.

HYPOTHESIS: Vitamin C and the inclusion of fibroblasts will assist with the
prolonged adhesion of MuSCs onto Zein scaffolds.

RESULTS SUMMARY: See Results summary

CONCLUSIONS: Due to the inability to stain either fibroblast or MuSCs using
immunofluorescence it is unclear whether the addition of fibroblast cells or
Vitamin C improves MuSC adherence or promotes sustained adherence

NEXT STEPS:

1. Optimise or develop a staining procedure that can enables both fibroblast and MuSC to be stained using immunofluorescence in a co-culture system.
