Note  
After isolation, please split the crude homogenate into 5 equal portions.
Please freeze 2 of the 5 samples as homogenate. The remaining 3 samples should
be cultured.

1\. Reduce the temperature on the water bath to 30 degrees. Pre-warm trypsin
EDTA to 30 degrees Celsius 15:17 pm  




Process  
1\. Place biopsy into 50mL tube. Wash by adding 10mL of PBS , mixing a little
and then discarding the PBS. Repeat wash timestamp  
2\. Remove the biopsy from tube and place on 100mm plate.  
3\. Finely macerate the tissue using scissors, forceps and scalpel.  
4\. transfer the macerated tissue to a 50ml falcon tubes and add 10ml pre-
warmed (30 degrees) trypsin solution (0.1% trypsin-EDTA in PBS) 15:44  
5\. Seal the tube well with Parafilm and incubate in a 30Â°C water bath with
agitation (60-70 rpm on the recommended model of shaking water bath)  15:46pm  
6\. At 30 minute intervals (for 1.5 hours), collect supernatant and add fresh
trypsin solution to the biopsy.

7\. Put the supernatant in a 4 degrees C fridge until the completion of the
digestion.  
8\. Pool supernatant  and pass though a 40um cell strainer.  
9\. Divide into 5 separate falcon tubes.  
10\. Collect cells by centrifuging at 400xg for 5min. 18:08 - 18:13 pm.  
RS Leaving, handing custody of cells to Michael 18:08 pm




Freezing isolates  
  
After isolation, please freeze 2 of the 5 samples as homogenate. 3 samples
should be cultured immediately. See details here :

  1. Aspirate supernatant from each pellet
  2. Resuspend each pellet in 2mL Freeze Media
  3. Aliquot 4 x 500uL aliquots into pre-labelled cryovials.
  4. Transfer vials immediately to a Mr Frosty and into the -80C freezer     :   pm
