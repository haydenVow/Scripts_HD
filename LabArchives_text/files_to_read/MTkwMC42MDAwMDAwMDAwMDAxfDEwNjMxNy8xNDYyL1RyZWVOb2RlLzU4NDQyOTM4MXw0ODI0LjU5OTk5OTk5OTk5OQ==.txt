Growth Media:

  * 'serum' = DMEM/F12 + 20% FBS + 1x P/S + 10uM p38i
  * E810C
  * E810C no GABA
  * E810C + extra ethanolamine and p38i
  * E810C + extra ethanolamine and p38i, no EGF, GABA, LIF

  




### Process:

1\. Took image of vessel with microscope on phase setting.

2\. Gelatin coated     5     x    T25      vessel with sterile filtered 0.1%
gelatin solution and then incubated all coated flasks at 37˚C.

  1. Time when all vessels(s) placed into the incubator       13 : 05    

3\. Aliquotted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then
placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath for a minimum of 20 minutes
prior to use:

  1. TrypLE:     16    mL in     1    tubes
  2.  dPBS (for washing and neutralising):      32   mL in    1    tubes
  3. Growth media (for pellet resuspension and seeding):     6.2mL of each condition   mL in   1      tube each  

Time that all aliquots were placed in the water bath the warm before use    13
: 30  

Note: if aliquots were placed in water bath at different time, record the time
stamp for each individual solution.




4\. Removed vessel(s) from the incubator

5\. Washed the vessel(s) with dPBS (warmed).

6\. Added    3mL/flask     tryple to each vessel/well and incubated at 37˚C.

  1. Start/Finish for TrypLE was     13:51-14:11     

7\. Neutralised with     3mL/flask     dPBS and combined cell suspension into
a    1     tube for each condition.

8\. Centrifuged at 650 x g for 5 min.

  1. Start/Finish time for centrifugation was    14 : 23 - 14:28  




9\. Aspirated the supernatant(s).

10\. Resuspended pellet(s) in      0.2   mL      of each growth    media  

11\. Aliquoted       10uL   of resuspended cells into a microcentrifuge tube
for cell count.

12\. Performed a cell count using the haemocytometer and recorded the cell
count data in the Google Doc spreadsheet called 'Cell Count Spreadsheet' (see
link below):

SSIBtIylyrBQE5kRX5Z8NtI/edit#gid=0

  1.  Total cell number was:  
    1. serum: 115 200 
    2. E810C: 50 400
    3. E810C no GABA: 59 200 
    4. E810C + extra ethanolamine and p38i: 78 400
    5. E810C + extra ethanolamine and p38i, no GABA, EGF, LIF:  43 200      

  2. Volume of cell suspension required for subculturing (25 000 cells) was:
    * serum: 43 uL 
    * E810C: 99 uL
    * E810C no GABA: 84 uL 
    * E810C + extra ethanolamine and p38i: 64 uL
    * E810C + extra ethanolamine and p38i, no GABA, EGF, LIF: 116 uL
    *  
  3. Cell density per vessel:    1000cells/cm^2       




13\. Transferred      25 000 cells from each cell suspension into 5 mL of
respective media

14\. Transferred cell suspension into the pre-gelatin coated       T25
vessel.

15\. Left at RT in the BSC for 20 min to allow cells to settle     13 : 35 -
13:55 a/pm  

16\. Transferred vessel(s) to incubate at:

  * [X]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (avian cells)
