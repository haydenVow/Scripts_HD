Prepare materials for thaw and seed:

  

1. Aliquotted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath for a minimum of 20 minutes prior to use: 

  *  Growth media (for seeding):   30 mL in  1  tubes 
  * Time that aliquot was placed in the water bath to warm before use:  11 :06 am

## Thaw and seed vial:

3\. Collected the cryovial from Liquid Nitrogen storage & place in foam
floater in water bath for 5 min  11:34 - 11:39 am

Location where cryovial was collected from:

Vial details:  1   x  F_DOLLY12  cryovials at  1M  cells each for a total of
1M  cells

Brew

Tower/Bucket 1  

Box/Cane 2  

Vial location: B1  

Vial ID(s): 2289-Culture-6303-Vial-10of115  

`4. Ethanol sprayed & transferred the vial(s) to the BSC.`

`5.  Added  500 µL of Growth Media (to generate a total volume of 1mL in the
cryovial) to the cryovial, resuspended the cell suspension gently to reduce
osmotic shock. `

`6. Collected the entire 1mL of cell suspension & transfer into the pre-warmed
tube of Growth Media. `

`7. Using a 10mL serological pipette, resuspended & distributed the cells
evenly in the  30 mL of pre-warmed Growth Media (prepared in Step 2). `

`8. Transfered  30 mL to the  T175  flask`

`9. Transfered flask to incubate at: 11:42 am  
`

  * [ x ]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (aviary cells)

  

Making labels

Note - You will need to increase the passage number by one. (i.e. if your
thawed vial ID has a passage number of 3, when you make a culture ID for you
vessel you will need change the passage number to 4 on Airtable.)

Summary:

1M F_DOLLY12 cells revived into 1 x T175 flask in DMEM/F12 + 20% FBS + 1X P/S




### Results:

  * Results were;
    * [ X ]  As Usual (this is a repetitive task)
    * [ ]  Unexpected because...
    * [ ]  Need to be further analysed
    * [ ]  Other (.......)
