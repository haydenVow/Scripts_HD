## Performed by:




Reagent preparation:

1\. Aliquotted    7 mL  PBS for washing

2\. Centrifuged the secondary antibody stock using the benchtop
microcentrifuge for 10 seconds.

3\. Prepared Secondary Antibody mix (pipette from the top/supernatant of
antibody solution):

  1.3 ÂµL   IgG (H&L) AF488   (1:1000  ) +  1.3  mL Blocking Buffer (PBST (0.1%
Triton X + dPBS) + 3% BSA)  

If using AlexaFluor secondary antibodies then the max concentration should be
1:500 (typically used at 1:1000)

Pipette-mixed antibody mix and stored refrigerated away from light until
needed.

4\. Prepared DAPI mix:

  1.3 mL  PBS +   1.3 mL  of DAPI

Vortexed DAPI mix and stored refrigerated away from light until needed.




Process:

1\. Removed plate from fridge (incubated in primary antibodies overnight).

2\. Washed 3 times for 5 min with PBS at RT.

 14:00 - 14:05

 14:05 - 14:10

 14:10 - 14:15

3\. Incubated the cells with secondary antibody mixture in the dark at RT for
1 hour.  14:15 - 15:15

NOTE: from this step onwards protect from the light by wrapping plates in foil
and perform experiment in the dark.




Counter staining

1\.  Removed 2nd antibody solution.  15:15

2\.  Washed with DAPI (1:1000) in PBS for 5 min at RT in the dark.

 15:20 - 15:25  

3\.  Washed in PBS 2 x 5 min at RT in the dark. (No Triton)

 15:25 - 15:30  

 15:30 - 15:35  

4\.  Replaced dPBS.

 15:35  

5\. Confirmed staining on microscope by imaging.




SOPs used:

  * SOP_Immunofluorescence Staining V_02

  




Observations/Summary:

Many dead cells. Some fixed healthy looking cells. Stains not showing up very
well. Hard to see anything for the Ki67 stain.

### Results

  * Results were;
    * [ ]  As Usual (this is a repetitive task)
    * [ X]  Unexpected because...
    * [ ]  Need to be further analysed
    * [ ]  Other (.......)

The stains do not show up very well, including DAPI.
