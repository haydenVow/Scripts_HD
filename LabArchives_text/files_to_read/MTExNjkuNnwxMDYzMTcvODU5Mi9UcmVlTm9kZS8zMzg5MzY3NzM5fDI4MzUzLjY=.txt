Troubleshooting

10:45 - TT identified that there were some issues with the set up of the
Biostat, namely that the microsparger was not connected, the metal harvest
line was connected to an air filter and the dip tube (ending in a piece of
silicone tubing) was impeding the stirring of the impeller. It was also noted
that the impeller was precessing about an axis.

The media from within the Biostat was pumped out and the connections to the
base, inoculum and media bottles were left in a sterile manner inside the BSC.
After that, the harvest tube and dip tube were removed from the headplate. The
microsparger was installed in the port adjacent to the exhaust outlet (better
to group gas-related tubes) and the metallic harvest tube was installed in
another port to account for the previously mentioned change. The impeller
shaft was also inspected more closely and was determined to have a slight bend
in it. The position of the impeller was also adjusted to make room for the
microsparger and the harvest tube (in order from top to bottom: impeller
shaft, microsparger, harvest tube).

After the required amendments were made, the Biostat was re-autoclaved.

Tested for sterility - Not performed - no obvious cloudiness in medium after
overnight hold

  1.  ~~Took a sample and transfer it to the well of a well plate.~~
  2.  ~~Observed the sample under the microscope.~~
    1.  ~~Signs of contamination include cloudy culture medium, motile particles visible under the 60x or 100x objective.~~

Calibrated dissolved oxygen probe

  1. Ran the calibration routine as per the operating manual
    1.  ~~Sparged nitrogen gas at high flow rate and with high impeller speed until dissolved oxygen reading equilibrated at a very low level.~~
    2.  ~~Set that level as 0%~~
    3. Sparged air at high flow rate and with high impeller speed until dissolved oxygen reading equilibrated at a high level.
    4. Set that level as 100%

Set level probe - Not performed.

  1.  ~~Loosened the nut around the antifoam/level probe.~~
  2.  ~~Gently rotated and pulled the probe out until it reached the desired height.~~
  3.  ~~Tightened the nut until finger tight.~~

NotesNEVER push the probe back into the bioreactor after autoclaving as this
can introduce contamination.  
  
  
  
  
  
  




Configured dissolved oxygen cascade

  1. Set 0% output as 20 ccm (10% of max output, to maintain internal pressure) and 240 RPM (0.7 m/s tip speed, as per previous mfg batches).
  2. Set 100% output as 200 ccm (0.1 vvm) and 360 RPM (1.0 m/s tip speed, as per the Nuvonis recommendations for maximum tip speed).
  3. Set intermediate outputs evenly between these

Seeded the batch

  1. Thoroughly wiped down the seed bottle and corresponding line from the bioreactor with 70% ethanol.
  2. Placed the seed bottle and the end of the seed line in the BSC next to the bioreactor.
  3. Aseptically transferred the seed cells to the seed bottle.
  4. Add medium ingredients:

NotesWent back to check previous lab book entry and saw that antifoam,
L-glutamine and glucose had already been added - this means that the actual
concentrations would be 50% higher than desired.  
  
  
  




Programmed the feed schedule - not performed as not required
