Process:

 1\. Aliquotted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and
then placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath for a minimum of 20 minutes
prior to use:

  1.  TrypLE:  50 mL in | 1 | tubes
  2.  dPBS (for neutralising)  2 x 50 mL in | 2 | tubes 
  3.  Time that all aliquots were placed in the water bath to warm before use:  15:49 pm 

Note: if aliquots were placed in water bath at different times, record the
time stamp for each individual solution.




2\. Washed the flask(s) with dPBS.

3\. Added | 10 |mL tryple to each vessel/well and incubated at 37ºC for |
16:24-16:36 | min

4\. Neutralised with | 10mL | dPBS (warmed) and combined cell suspension into
a | 3 x  50mL | tube.

5\. Centrifuged at 650 x g for 5 min

  1.  Start/Finish time for centrifugation was:   16:44 - 16:49 pm   




6\. Collected CryoStor10 (CS10) from fridge. ID # 4439

7\. Aspirated supernatant carefully, taking care not to disturb the pellet.

8a. Resuspended each 2-flask pellet in | 2 |mL freeze media (chilled, to
reduce DMSO toxicity).

9\. Aliquotted | 1000 |µL into | 2 | x cryovials (already labelled).

8b. Resuspended the 1-flask pellet in | 1 |mL freeze media (chilled, to reduce
DMSO toxicity).

9\. Aliquotted | 1000 |µL into | 1 | x cryovials (already labelled).

10\. Tightened the lids & transfer the cryovials to a Mr. Frosty immediately
into the -80ºC freezer.  17:30 pm

17\. Allow the cells to freeze for at least 18-24 hours before transferring to
Liquid Nitrogen storage.
