Clones that appeared 100% confluent on plate 12683 were expanded to 24 well
plates.

Briefly.

  1. Whole wells containing Clones were imaged using the Zaber multiwell imaging system. 
  2. Clones that appeared confluent were given a binary marking of '1' and clones that did not appear confluent were given the binary marking of '0' on the pick lists here: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1yQD_JrhzktpQd0vaCt2B5OskKgl9SipLLab3WZ9v7ZU/edit#gid=1820332829
  3. For clones that appeared ready for passage, media was aspirated and discarded from the culture
  4. 100uL of dPBS was added to wash the cells 
  5. dPBS was collected and discarded
  6. 100uL of Tryple-EDTA was added to the cells. 
  7. cells were incubated for 10 minutes at 30 degrees, 5% CO2. 
  8. Cells were then collected from each well and transferred to individual wells on a 24 well plate containing 1mL fresh growth media (DMEM/F12 + 20% FBS + 1xP/S) 
  9. Plate was returned to the incubator along with the new 24 well plate, incubating in incubator 140, 30 degrees, 5% co2. CULTUE 13014.
