Observation of SILKIE cultures prior to bank.

SILKIEO and SILKIEK cultures were both approx. 95% confluent with healthy,
fibroblastic morphologies. SILKIEF was only 10% confluent, with a large amount
of debris in the media.

Process

 1\. Aliquoted reagents and placed in the cell culture incubator to warm for a
minimum of 30 minutes prior to use:

  1. T75 flask were pre-filled with 12mL of growth media per flask and placed in the incubator to warm and to equilibrate. 2x flasks were filled for each of the 3 media types. 
  2. TrypLE:  30mL 
  3. dPBS (for washing and neutralising)   60mL 
  4. Media (for pellet resuspension):  10mL (of each media)
  5. Discarded spent media
  6. Washed each flask with 10mL PBS
  7. Added 10mL of Tryple to each flask and incubated for 10min
  8. Added 10mL PBS to each flask to neutralise
  9. Transferred cell suspensions to 50mL falcon tubes
  10. Centrifuged at 500g for 5min




Process post centrifugation.

  1.  Aspirated the supernatant(s). 
  2. Resuspend pellet(s) in |1ml (SILKIEF) or 5mL (SILKIEK and SILKIEF)respective growth medias| 
  3. Performed a cell count using the haemocytometer and recorded the cell count data in the Google Doc spreadsheet called 'Cell Count Spreadsheet' https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1DPzKubYxfHmWogVPihC-SSIBtIylyrBQE5kRX5Z8NtI/edit#gid=0  
Total cell number was: | 14M (SILKIEK), 2M (SILKIEO), 750k(SILKIEF)|

  4. All cells from SILKIEO and SILKIEF were seeded back into culture. 1 x pre-filled T75 flask for SILKIEF and 2x prefilled flask for SILKIEO(13.33k cells/cm)
  5. For SILKIEK, The remaining cells were centrifuged at approx. 500g for 5min.
  6. Cell pellet resuspended in chilled Cryostor CS10 transferred into cyrovials as follows
  7. SILKIEK 6mL (2M cells/mL) - In 6vials 
  8. Transfered the cryovials to a Mr. Frosty immediately into the -80ÂºC freezer.

    * [ ]  2nd Freeze
    * [x]  3rd Freeze
    * [ ]  4th Freeze
    * [ ]  5th Freeze
  9. Allowed the cells to freeze for at least 18-24 hours before transferring to Liquid Nitrogen storage.
