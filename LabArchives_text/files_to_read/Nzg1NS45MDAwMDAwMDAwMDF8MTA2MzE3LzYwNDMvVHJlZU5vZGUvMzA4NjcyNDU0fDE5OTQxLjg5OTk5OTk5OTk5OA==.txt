Procedure
  
  
  1. Prepared a 50 ug/mL Hoechst solution by combining following ingredients in a sterile amber/light safe falcon tube  
(volumes are enough for staining 1 x 384 well plate):

    1. 28.5 mL x MilliQ
    2. 1.5 mL x Hoechst Trihydrochloride trihydrate (1 mg/mL)
  2. Vortexed Hoechst solution for 5 seconds to mix 
  3. Syringe filtered solution with a 0.22 um filter unit to sterilise 
  4. Transferred Hoechst solution to a sterile reservoir unit that is wide enough to fit the Integra automated multichannel pipette 
  5. Added 11 uL of Hoechst solution to each well for a final Hoechst concentration of 5 ug/mL (this is assuming a 100 uL volume of medium in each well after FACS sorting and medium top-up - adjust as needed for actual well volume)
  6. Incubated plate at RT in the dark for 30 minutes   12:12 - 12:42
  7. Performed a 100% medium change to remove Hoechst from cell culture. 
    * Note: This is an important step, as Hoechst is harmful to cells if left in the medium too long. Please limit Hoechst exposure to a maximum of 2 hours. 
  8. Zaber imaged plate(s) on DAPI channel (imaged entire wells) 
  9. Once Zaber images were available on MIA, analysed on retool using "DAPI 384-well cell count" to procure cell count and attached Excel output files below
