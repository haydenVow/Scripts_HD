Aim/Purpose


To test whether proliferation of fibroblasts using media containing DMEM/F12
made in-house is similar to media containing commercial DMEM/F12


Hypothesis


Doubling time of fibroblasts in both media will be similar


Technical Gap


We have never made DMEM/F12 in-house and used it for growing fibroblasts.


Method/Procedure


50L of PRF DMEM/F12 was made in-house. From this, 100mL was put aside at the
beginning of the filtration process. Another 100mL was put aside near the end
of the filtration process.

  1. Thaw DOLLY12 WCB fibroblasts into 3x T25 flasks (7000 cells/cm^2) in the following media
    1. Commercial DMEM/F12 + 10% FBS
    2. In-house DMEM/F12 + 10% FBS (from early filtration)
    3. In-house DMEM/F12 + 10% FBS (from later filtration)
  2. 24h after thawing, perform a 50% media change 
  3. Passage every 4-6 days and perform cell counts to calculate cell doublings. 
  4. To perform a proliferation assay:
    1. seed 7000 cells/cm^2 into 1x column of 3x 96 wp for each media condition.
      1. 1x plate will the imaged on day 1, day 3, and day 5 (to see if we can use only 1 plate for future prolif assays). 
      2. In case Hoescht stain and imaging affects cell growth, we also have 2x additional plates which we will stain on day 3 and 5, image, and then discard so that cells aren't kept in culture after staining.
    2. On day 1, Hoechst stain 1x 96 wp and image on the Zaber. Return this plate to the incubator and label it as 'live staining'.
    3. On day 3, check whether the Hoechst stain on the 'live staining' plate looks bright and is visible in all the cells. Re-stain if needed and then image on the Zaber. Return to incubator.
    4. One day 3, Hoechst stain another 1x 96 wp and image on the Zaber. This plate can be discarded.
    5. On day 4, check whether the Hoechst stain on the 'live staining' plate looks bright and is visible in all the cells. Re-stain if needed and then image on the Zaber. Return to incubator.
    6. One day 4, Hoechst stain another 1x 96 wp and image on the Zaber. This plate can be discarded.
  5. Process images through MIA to obtain cell counts
  6. Using GraphPad:
    1. compare cell counts between conditions at different time points
    2. compare doubling times between conditions
    3. generate graphs of growth curves 
    4. generate graphs of cell counts at different time points
