Media/Reagents used:

  

NameDetails (reagent ID)  
0.1% gelatin solution  
  
Tryple  
  
dPBS (for washing & neutralising)  
  
Growth Media  
  
p38i (20mM stock)

Process:

 1\. Aliquotted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and
then placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath for a minimum of 20 minutes
prior to use:

  1.  TrypLE:  mL in |  | tubes
  2.  dPBS (for neutralising)    mL in |  | tubes 
  3.  Growth media (for pellet resuspension):    mL in |  | tubes 
  4.  Time that all aliquots were placed in the water bath to warm before use:    : a/pm 

Note: if aliquots were placed in water bath at different times, record the
time stamp for each individual solution.




2\. Washed the flask(s) with dPBS.

3\. Added |  |mL tryple to each vessel/well and incubated at 37ºC for |  | min

  1.  Added |  |mL tryple to each vessel/well and incubated at 37ºC for |  | min

4\. Neutralised with |  | dPBS (warmed) and combined cell suspension into a |
| tube.

5\. Centrifuged at 650 x g for 5 min

  1.  Start/Finish time for centrifugation was:   : - : a/pm   




6\. Aspirated the supernatant(s).

7\. Resuspend pellet(s) in |  |mL |  | media.

8\. Performed a cell count using the haemocytometer and recorded the cell
count data in the Google Doc spreadsheet called 'Cell Count Spreadsheet' (see
link below):

SSIBtIylyrBQE5kRX5Z8NtI/edit#gid=0

9\. Total cell number was: |  |

10\. Calculate the required volume cell suspension & freeze medium to generate
a concentration of ~1M cells/mL.




11\. Prepared   mL Freeze Medium: (FBS + 10% DMSO). ID #  

Stored at 4ºC until use to keep chilled.

12\. Centrifuged cells at 650 x g for 5 min.  :  \-  :  a/pm

Whilst centrifuge is spinning, prepared & printed vial labels, labelled
cryovials. (Note that passage number will be the same as the culture you
harvest from. The passage number will increase by 1 during the revive of a
vial.)




13\. Aspirated supernatant carefully, taking care not to disturb the pellet.

14\. Resuspended the pellet in |  |mL freeze media (chilled, to reduce DMSO
toxicity).

15\. Aliquotted |  |µL into |  | x cryovials (already labelled).

16\. Tightened the lids & transfer the cryovials to a Mr. Frosty immediately
into the -80ºC freezer.   :   a/pm

  * [ ]  Without foam
  * [ ]  1st Freeze

17\. Allow the cells to freeze for at least 18-24 hours before transferring to
Liquid Nitrogen storage.
