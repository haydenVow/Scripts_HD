Process:

*Will need sterile media reservoir for this feed*  

  1. Checked both plates under microscope to ensure cells are in wells. Noted any abnormalities in the "Observation" section below.
  2. Placed previously aliquotted media in water bath   10:57 - ~12:40  
  3. Removed  100  % of supernatant from vessel. You can use the same tips between columns/rows
  4. Replaced with  140uL  (per well/per vessel) of  E6   media. 
  5. Returned vessel to incubate at: 13:00

  * [X]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (aviary cells)

  

  * Incubator (Sanyo), Lab [Main]




### Observations/Summary:

Cells in both plates looked round and dead.
