### Process:

1\. Took image of vessel with microscope on phase setting.

3\. Aliquotted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then
placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath for a minimum of 20 minutes
prior to use:

  1. TrypLE:   15   mL in    1   tubes
  2.  dPBS (for neutralising):   15   mL
  3.  dPBS (for washing):   15    mL
  4. Growth media (for pellet resuspension):   4   mL
  5. 20% FBS Growth media (for seeding F_DOLLY12_3P23 cells):   6  mL 
  6. 10% FBS Growth media (for seeding F_NANDO3 cells):   6  mL 

Time that all aliquots were placed in the water bath the warm before use
14:43 pm

Note: if aliquots were placed in water bath at different time, record the time
stamp for each individual solution.




4\. Removed vessel(s) from the incubator    15:02 pm

5\. Washed the vessel(s) with dPBS (warmed).

6\. Added   15   mL tryple to each vessel/well and incubated at 37˚C.

  1. Start/Finish for TrypLE was   15:07 pm 

7\. Neutralised with     15mL     dPBS and combined cell suspension into a
50mL     tube.

8\. Centrifuged at 650 x g for 5 min.

  1. Start/Finish time for centrifugation was   15:16 - 15:21 pm 




9\. Aspirated the supernatant(s).

10\. Resuspended pellet(s) in     4    mL   Growth  media    15:25 pm

11\. Aliquoted       10uL   of resuspended cells into a microcentrifuge tube
for cell count.

12\. Performed a cell count using the haemocytometer and recorded the cell
count data in the Google Doc spreadsheet: Cell Count Spreadsheet or cell count
widget below

  1. Total cell number was:        1.68M    

  2. Volume of cell suspension required for subculture was:     100uL       

  3. Cell density per vessel:     Note* miscalculation. Original plan to sed 3,500 cells / cm2. However, upon calculation, RS calculated 3,500 cell / well.  
Therefore, RS asked BT for 42,000 F_NANDO3 cells (from other passage), and
they were put aside after harvest for RS to use.  
The decision was made that instead of seeding 6-well plates, 6 wells of
24-well plates were seeded with 3,500 cells per well (1.9cm2, therefore 1842
cells / cm2 was the final seeding density).  




13\. Transferred      100     µl of F_DOLLY12_3P23 cell suspension to the pre-
warmed       6    mL Growth media:

13\. Transferred      42K cells (aliquotted by BT after F_NANDO3 harvest) of
F_NANDO3 cell suspension to the pre-warmed     6    mL Growth media:

14\. Transferred 500uL/well of each cell suspension into the 6 x wells of 2 x
24-well plates for each cell line.

16\. Transferred vessel(s) to incubate at: 15:59 pm  

  * [ X ]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (avian cells)




Observations/Summary:

F_NANDO3 cells and F_DOLLY12_3P23 cells were each seeded into 12 x wells of
24-well plates (~1800 cells / cm2).
