Process:

Created mixes of media ingredients as shown in the table below. Underlined
ingredients were not added because they will be added on the day of the feed.




1\. Add the following ingredients (highlighted green in the table below) to
make the basal media.  
6G supplement: 1:100 ACA, 100ng/mL FGF/IGF/PDGF, 1:100 (4mM) glutamax, 1xP/S

8G supplement: 100ng/mL FGF/IGF/PDGF, 1:100 glutamax, lipid supplement 1:1000,
RGD 100 ng/mL, and YIGSR 100 ng/mL +1x p/s

10G supplement: 1:100 ACA,  100ng/mL FGF/IGF/PDGF, 1:100 glutamax, 1 g/L
pluronic, lipid supplement 1:1000, RGD 100 ng/mL, and YIGSR 100 ng/mL +1x p/s

Underlined ingredients (including KSR) should be added fresh on the day of
feed.
