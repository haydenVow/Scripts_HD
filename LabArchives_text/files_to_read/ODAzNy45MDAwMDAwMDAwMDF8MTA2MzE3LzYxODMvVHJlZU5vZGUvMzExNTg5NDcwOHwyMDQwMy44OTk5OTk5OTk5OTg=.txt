Our "northstar"  is to create 10 cultured delicacy prototypes by end of 2022
with the following constraints:

  * Are food safe
  * Have been eaten by real customers, so we've made at least 1kg of edible prototype
  * We know which market wants these and those customers have eaten it & said they want it
  * We have a plan for scaling this product up to 1 tonne
