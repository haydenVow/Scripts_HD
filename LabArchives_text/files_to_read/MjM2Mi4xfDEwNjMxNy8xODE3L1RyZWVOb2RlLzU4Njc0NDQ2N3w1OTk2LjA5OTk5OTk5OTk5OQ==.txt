Hydrate and sterilize microcarriers

  1. Added | 5 g|  dry Cytodex microcarriers to a suitably siliconized (sigmacote) (non-stick) glass bottle.
  2. Performed step 1 in 5x bottles.
  3. PBS (free of Ca2+, Mg2+), ~250 mL was added to the bottle and the microcarriers allowed to swell for at least 1.5 h at in the incubator at 165 RPM shaking. 12:00 - 14:00 Fri  

  4. Final Concentration |  20   g/L | 
  5. The supernatant was removed and replaced with fresh PBS (free of Ca2+, Mg2+) (50mL/g Cytodex). Carriers were washed with gentle agitation for a few minutes by hand. 
  6. Carriers were allowed to settle once more and the supernatant was discarded and replaced with fresh PBS (free of Ca2+, Mg2+) (50 mL/g Cytodex) 
  7. Microcarriers were sterilized by autoclaving with steam from purified water, 121 degrees, 30 minutes.  | 15:00 Fri |
  8. Once the autoclave chamber cooled to approximately 70 deg C, the sterilized suspension was transferred to a BSC to cool completely.
  9. Once cooled completely, the bottle was orbitally shaken by hand to completely resuspend the microcarriers and a 1 mL sample was taken.
  10. The Stockyard label was created, including comments with the microcarrier concentration (in microcarriers/mL).
  11. The label was stuck on the bottle and the bottle stored at 4 deg C. Fridge #104 | 9:30 am Mon  |
