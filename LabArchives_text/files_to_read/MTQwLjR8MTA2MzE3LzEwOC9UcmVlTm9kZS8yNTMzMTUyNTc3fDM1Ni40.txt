Growth Media:  

  * [x]  DMEM/F12 + 20% FBS + 1X P/S + P38i (10uM)

  

  

Process:

1\. Gelatin coated  2  x  T175  flasks with sterile filtered 0.1% gelatin
solution and then incubated all coated flasks at 37ºC

  1. Time when all flasks placed into the incubator14:21
  2.  Due to requiring a total of 4 gelatin flasks another 2 T175 flasks were gelatin coated 14:46

2\. Aliquotted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then
placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath for a minimum of 20 minutes
prior to use:

  1. Growth media (for seeding):   120 mL in  2x 70 mL  pots
  2. Time that aliquot was placed in the water bath to warm before use:  14:52

3\. Collected the cryovial from Liquid Nitrogen storage & place in foam
floater in water bath for 5 min  15:41 - 15:46

Location where cryovial was collected from:

`Brew Tower/Bucket # 3 `

`Box/Cane # 2 `

`Vial location: F1 `

`Vial ID(s): 2131-Culture-5896-Vial-1of27`

  

`Brew Tower/Bucket # 3 `

`Box/Cane # 2 `

`Vial location: F2 `

`Vial ID(s): 2134-Culture-5896-Vial-2of27`

  

4\. Ethanol sprayed & transferred the vial(s) to the BSC.

5\. Added  500 µL of Growth Media (to generate a total volume of 1mL in the
cryovial) to the cryovial, resuspended the cell suspension gently to reduce
osmotic shock.

6\. Collected the entire 1mL of cell suspension & transfer into the pre-warmed
tube of Growth Media.

7\. Using a 10mL serological pipette, resuspended & distributed the cells
evenly in the  120 mL of pre-warmed Growth Media (prepared in Step 2).

8\. Transfered  30 mL to each pre-coated  T175  flask, allow to rest in the
BSC at RT for 30 min  16:00 - 16:30

9\. Transfered flask/plate(s) to incubate at:

  * [x]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (aviary cells)

  

Making labels

Note - You will need to increase the passage number by one. (i.e. if your
thawed vial ID has a passage number of 3, when you make a culture ID for you
vessel you will need change the passage number to 4 on Airtable.)
