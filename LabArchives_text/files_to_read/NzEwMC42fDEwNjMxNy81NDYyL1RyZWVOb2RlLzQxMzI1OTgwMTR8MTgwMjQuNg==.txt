RELATED TO OKR:  

\- Develop a QMS-compliant serum-free media that supports 20+ doublings of our
chosen species in suspension, at a doubling rate <48hrs

\- Characterise 2x QMS-compliant suspension-adapted fibroblast clones from our
chosen species

AIM/PURPOSE: Perform a suspension SCC run of the three best performing
F_DOLLY12 cells in CD-CHO media.

HYPOTHESIS: Single DOLLY_12 fibroblasts sorted in 384 wells that have been
adapted to suspension over 30 days will survive in suspension such that we
will attain â‰¥1 clonal cell line.  

RESULTS SUMMARY:

See final report.

CONCLUSIONS:

Of the three cultures that were FACS sorted into 384 ULA plates, no plate
contained cell that proliferated over the ~40 days in culture. It is unclear
if the cells that were taken from the existing suspension cultures were a
viable population capable of proliferation to begin with, prior to FACS
sorting. Therefore, it appears more appropriate to FACS sort adherent
populations into 384 ULA plates unless the cell population is confirmed to be
suspension adapted.

The hypothesis was not supported.

NEXT STEPS:

  * Perform FACS sorting of cells that have been confirmed as being suspension adapted if they are required to be cloned instead of cell population currently being attempted to be adapted.
