Growth Media:

  * [x]  DMEM/F12 + 20% FBS + 1X P/S + P38i (10uM)

### Process:

SEEDING

### Process:

Intermittent agitation to facilitate adhesion

  1. Transferred 4.462mL of cell suspension, collected from cell expansion tream, (see passage entry here: https://www.notion.so/vow/6-Cycle-5-Harvest-5-x-T175-and-1-x-4CF-and-seed-2-x-4CF-Mon-5aabf8dd62cc431689d3ac8323bca7ba ) containing 5.8`million cells` to  60 mL of equilibrated microcarrier suspension in the culture  E250 vessel.

  1. Began the seeding schedule for 6 hours (below) using the KASA app.
    1. The minimum required agitation speed for shaken cultures to maintain the microcarriers in suspension can be estimated using this calculator: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/18NrC_xaJ2I87B4x3vTE46Z-ZUS3EV0Gw-CnM0DcukL4/edit?usp=sharing
      * Shake speed used = 120rpm  

    2. The seeding schedule may be reduced or extended by removing or adding 30 minute cycles as required. Generally, at least 3 but up to 12 hours are required to allow the maximum number of the inoculated cells to adhere.
