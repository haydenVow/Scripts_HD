13013-Nuvonis Quail Suspension341-P-1of1  
50/50 RPMI/CHO + 1 mg/mL yeast + 0.02 mg/mL L-Ornithine monohydrochloride &
Putrescine dihydrochloride + 1 g/L poloxamer-188 + 0.0005 mg/mL IGF + 0.0001
mg/mL EGF (with 4 mM L-Glutamine & 6 g/L glucose final conc.)  
Main lab, incubator #86


Process
  
  
  1. Took 1 x 550 uL aliquot from E250 and performed count on ViCell
  2. Recorded counts in media results spreadsheet: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1cnmEz5amKSGmA9u3BJ-Dn0w-I7zFobBr6pG-UWCYaXM/edit#gid=595130609
    1. Cell count: 74,772,000 (804K cells/mL) 
  3. Removed 56 mL of cell suspension, leaving 37 mL behind with 30M cells 
  4. Added 63 mL of warmed 50/50 RPMI/CHO Nuvonis suspension medium + GFs (with glucose and L-glut) to flask to bring volume up to 100 mL and cell seeding density to ~300K cells/mL 
  5. Returned flask to incubator
