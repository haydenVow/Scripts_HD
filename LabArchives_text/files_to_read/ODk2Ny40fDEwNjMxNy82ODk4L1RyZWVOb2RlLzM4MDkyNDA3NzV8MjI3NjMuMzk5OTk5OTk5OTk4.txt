Preparation:

1\. Aliquotted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then
placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath for a minimum of 20 minutes
prior to use:

  1. TrypLE:    50   mL in  1     tube
  2. dPBS (for neutralising)     100  mL in    2   tubes
  3. dPBS (for pellet resuspension):     25  mL in    1    tube
  4. Times that all aliquots were placed in the water bath to warm before use   09 : 46 a/pm 

Note: if aliquots were placed in water bath at different times, record the
time stamp for each individual solution.




## Procedure

Note: refer to the table at the bottom of this entry for relevant volumes of
each reagent per flask type.  

  1. ~1 mL of growth media from each flask was sampled and stored in 1.5 mL tubes (labelled with culture ID and "media control"). These samples were stored at -80C for later use in the B12 detection ELISA as a set of positive controls.
  2. Washed the flask(s) with pre-warmed dPBS
    1. Volume/flask used:   10 mL    
    2. Time completed:     10 : 25 a/pm 
  3. Added    10mL  TrypLE  to each vessel and incubated at   30   ËšC for    5    min.  
Notes:  
\- Mammalian fibroblasts typically require 15-18 minutes of incubation with
TrypLE , slightly longer than MuSCs.  
\- CHOMP fibroblasts only require ~5 minutes with TrypLE (different to
mammalian species).

  4. Removed the stripped cells from the flask(s) using a serological pipette
  5. Washed each flask with   10  mL dPBS and added this to the cells from each flask
  6. Centrifuged at 600-700 x g for 5 min
    1. Start time for centrifugation was   10:50  a/pm 
  7. Aspirated the supernatant(s) to waste
  8. Resuspended pellets in      5  mL  dPBS each
  9.  Performed a cell count using the haemocytometer and recorded the cell count data in widget or the Google Doc spreadsheet called 'Cell Count Spreadsheet' (see link below): https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1DPzKubYxfHmWogVPihC-SSIBtIylyrBQE5kRX5Z8NtI/edit#gid=0 
  10. Once the cells from each flask were counted, centrifuged at 600-700 g for 5 minutes
    1. Start time for centrifugation was  11 :20  a/pm
  11. Supernatants from all tubes were carefully removed and ~1 mL stored in separate 1.5 mL tubes for freezing. 
  12. The remaining cell pellet tubes were labelled with: 
    1. EPIC# (30944)
    2. date 
    3. sample type/flask ID
  13. The samples were then frozen at -80C until needed for analysis




Cell Count Data

Cell counts were performed on sub-samples from each 5mL cell suspension. The
sub samples were stored at 4C and the counts were performed ~2-3 hours after
the harvest and freezing of the cells had taken place (due to logistics and
availability of people to do this work). Given that the counts were for
information purposes only and not required to progress to the next step, it
was not necessary to perform the counts prior to freezing each pellet.

Counts can be found in the Cell Count Spreadsheet

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1DPzKubYxfHmWogVPihC-
SSIBtIylyrBQE5kRX5Z8NtI/edit#gid=0

See screen capture of the raw data from each count below.

The results of the counts (also captured in a screen capture below) indicate
that additional B12 in the growth media may have some detrimental affect on
total cell yield or proliferation.
