### Process:

1\. Sequencing data was used to select clones from the IGFBP4 and PTEN+PABPC1
populations. Took images of these wells as well as ZIC1 clones that appeared
over 100% confluent or had started peeling. Generated a pick list for ZIC1
clones based on these images.

  




  

5\. Discarded supernatant from the wells containing the above clones, washed
each with 1mL of dPBS

6\. Added     1    mL tryple to each vessel/well and incubated at 30ËšC. for 8
minutes

7\. Neutralised with     1mL of     dPBS and collected each clonal population
in separate 15mL tubes. Returned the passaged plates back to the incubator
(82, 30 degrees C, 5% CO2)

8\. Centrifuged at 500 x g for 5 min.




9\. Aspirated the supernatant(s).

10\. Resuspended pellet(s) in growth media,12mL.  

11\. Mixed the suspensions for each clone then transferred the contents of
each suspension to individual T75 flasks.  

12\. Returned the plates to incubate at 30 degrees in incubator 140 in the
library lab, 5% CO2, 30 degrees.
