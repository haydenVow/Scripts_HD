Process:

1\. Cells were obtained from Nuvonis cell supply team. A cell count was
performed by aliquotting 550uL of culture media into a Vicell tube and loading
into the Vicell for counting.  
2\. A cell count of 2.33 million cells per mL was obtained.

3\. Culture media for seeding R850s was prepared by James H. Parent media
aliquot is 12404. Vitamin C and P/S was added to this media.

4\. Three 200mL pots of media were prepared and aliquotted. To one, Ficoll 400
was added at the appropriate concentration (see Experimental Plan for
concentration). Media was then sterile filtered using syringe filter.\

Conditions:

\- Ficoll 400 + Growth Media (Rolling)

\- Growth Media (Static)

\- Growth Media (Rolling)

5\. Media was placed in water bath at 37C for 1.5 hours.

6\. 5mL of culture media from E250 was seeded into each of the three media
aliquots, thus generating 11.6M cells for each roller bottle.

7\. Cell suspension was then transferred to 3 R850 roller bottles.

8\. Conditions 1 and 3 were placed in RP80 apparatus in Incubator 141 at 1 RPM
(37C, 5% CO2)

9\. Condition 2 was placed on the top shelf of Incubator 53 (37C, 5% CO2)
