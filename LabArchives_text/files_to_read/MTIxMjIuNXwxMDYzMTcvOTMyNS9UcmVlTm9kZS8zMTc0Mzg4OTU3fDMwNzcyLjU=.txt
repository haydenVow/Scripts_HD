Method

1\. Samples were collected from the manufacturing line and stored immediately
at 2-8°C.

2\. While working in a BSC, aliquot 9mL sterile dPBS into 2x 15 mL centrifuge
tubes per sample. Labelled tubes as 1:10 and 1:100 respectively.

3\. Resuspended 1.2734 g solid sample in 6 mL of dPBS by pipetting up and
down. Topped up with additional dPBS giving a total final volume of 12.734 mL
and vortexed to homogenise.

4\. Transferred 1mL of resuspended solid sample/liquid sample to 9mL dPBS for
a 1:10 dilution.

5\. With a new pipette thoroughly mix dilution by pipetting up and down, and
transferred 1mL of 1:10 dilution to 1:100 tube containing 9mL dPBS.

6\. Label each TSA plate with the following:  
\- Sample ID

\- Plate ID

\- Date

\- Time of incubation

\- Incubation temperature

5\. For plating, transferred 200 uL of resuspended solid sample/undiluted
sample to a TSA plate.

6\. Spread suspension using a spreader until the plate appears dry, being
careful not to touch the sides of the plate to prevent potential microbial
growth on the edges of the plate.

7\. Repeated steps 5 and 6 for 1:10 and 1:100 dilutions.

8\. Placed plates to a ziplock bag without sealing and transferred to
incubator. Fold over the opening of the bags so that the plates inside them
weigh down the opening of the bag (still unsealed)

9\. Incubated plates for 72 hours (+/- 2 hours) and perform CFU count.  
Incubator 179, 30°C, QC lab

10\. Remaining samples were stored in -80°C freezer.

  




Observation:  
  
Final pack of TSA plates were previously open with some cracked. A
considerable amount of condensation/moisture were on these plates. The samples
these plates were used for were noted accordingly.
