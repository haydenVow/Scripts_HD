Process:

  1. Placed the already aliquotted   16 mL of  each growth media (see table above) into water bath   11:08am  \-    11:23    a/pm 
  2.  Thawed p38i 20mM stock. Added 8uL of this to DMEM/F12 + 20% FBS + 1x P/S.
  3. Removed flasks from bottom Sanyo incubator. 
  4. Tilted flasks and waited for microcarriers to settle. Removed  50  % of supernatant from vessel. 
  5. Replaced with  15 mL (per vessel) of  growth   media as indicated in the table. 
  6. Returned vessel to incubate at on shaker(120 rpm):
    * [X]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
    * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (aviary cells)

  

  * [ ]  Thermo Incubator (ID #13)
  * [ ]  Top Sanyo Incubator (ID #25)
  * [X]  Bottom Sanyo Incubator
  * [ ]  Top Binder Incubator
  * [ ]  Bottom Binder Incubator
