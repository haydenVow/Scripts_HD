Counting & sampling process
  
  
  1. Aliquot 100 mL of each media type into a 120 mL container, having a total of 5 x 120mL containers.
  2. Add 100 uL of IGF and 20 uL of EGF to each media type. 
  3. Only add L-glutamine to CHO, MFG 50/50 RPMI/CHO and R&D 50/50 RPMI/CHO as per the E8 calculator:  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  

  4. Placed aliquots in the incubator.
  5. Retrieved a random selection of 10 x E125s from the incubator and transferred to BSC
  6. Transferred 500 uL samples from each flask into ViCell counting cups
  7. Loaded samples onto the Vicell. Note: When typing your sample name, please have the date followed by the culture ID so that the counts are uploaded automatically onto Ranger.
  8. Repeated steps 6-7 with remaining flasks.
  9. Recorded cell counts on the Team media spreadsheet  
  

  10. Waited for the counts to finish before proceeding with the next steps  
  

  11. If cell density has reached 1M cells/mL, 2M cells/mL etc. then follow all steps outlined in the section below titled 'Cell pellet weight'. If cell density has not reached 1M/mL, 2M/mL etc., then simply followed feed steps and ignored weighing steps. 
  12. Transferred all flasks back to incubator


Feed & cell pellet weighing protocol


When cell density reached 1M cells/mL, 2M cells/mL etc., perform these
additional steps:

  1. Retrieved 15 x 50 mL falcon tubes, weighed and transferred them to BSC
  2. Transferred cell suspension in each E125 flask into 50 mL falcon tubes, having a total of 15 x 50mL falcon tubes
  3. Centrifuged at 500 x g for 5 minutes
  4. Aspirated supernatant using a vacuum aspirator
  5. Weighed 50mL falcon tube containing the cell pellet and recorded new weight on the tube
  6. Brought back into BSC and re-suspended cell pellet in 30mL of fresh medium
  7. Transferred all flasks back to incubator
