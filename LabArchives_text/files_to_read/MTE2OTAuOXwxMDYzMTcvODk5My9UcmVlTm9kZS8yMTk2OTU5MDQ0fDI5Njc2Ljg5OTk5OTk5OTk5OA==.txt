Cells were combined and counted = 420,000. Very low = flasks were topped up
with media and left in incubator in case cells would grow.




Feed

Aliquoted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then
placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath > 20 minutes prior to use

  1. Growth media   20mL OptiPRO + 4mM Glutmax
  2. Collected cells in suspension into 2 x 50 mL tubes. 
  3. Centrifuged at 500 g for 5 minutes
  4. Removed spent media and discarded.
  5. Resuspended in the remaining 5mL media, 20uL was taken for a 1:2 count with trypan blue
  6. Returned to incubator 77 in library lab, 37C and 5% CO2, 170 RPM.
