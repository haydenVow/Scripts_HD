Stained and imaged cells adhered to microcarriers

  1. Removed culture(s) from the incubator and placed them in the BSC  `| 12:52 pm|`
  2. Swirled culture(s) by hand on the flat surface of the BSC for 5 seconds, the lid was quickly removed and a 20uL sample of the suspension was taken while the liquid was still in motion. This ensures the carriers were evenly mixed at time of sampling.
  3. Transferred the aliquot(s) to a well on a 96 well plate. This was done for 3 samples per E125 flask.
    1. Row A: culture 6805
    2. Row B: culture 6806
    3. columns 1, 2, and 3 were used for replicates
  4. Returned cultures to the incubator  `| 12:56  |`
  5. Mixed samples with 80 uL of dPBS containing 20uL/mL of Hoechst 33342. 
  6. Left the 96 well plate to incubate at room temperature, in the dark (away from light), for 12 minutes.  `| 13:00 - 13:10 |`
  7. Plates were imaged on the main lab Zaber on 5x. ~13:   
    1. Phase: illuminator lamp ~1, exposure 10
    2. DAPI: illuminator lamp ~35, exposure 50
    3. images captured under culture ID: 6807    




Process:

Growth media: Dmem/F12 + 20% FBS + 1xP/S + 10uM p38i

1\.  Aliquotted   30mL  mL of  Growth Media into   1x50mL    tube(s). Placed
in water bath   16:25 a/pm

2\. Removed both E125s from the incubator [16:30], removed  50  % of
supernatant from vessel.

3\. Replaced with  15 mL (per well/per vessel) of  growth   media.

4\. Returned vessel to incubate at: [16:39]

  * [x]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (aviary cells)

  

  * Incubator (#80 (bottom sanyo)), Lab [Main/]
