Only need to make:

\- 10L Tryple (Priority - need to do first)

\- 10L Growth media (lower priority - can do anytime in the week)

  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  




Growth media (10L)

Proposed method for Growth media (10L)

Reagent

  * DMEM - 3.95 L
  * F12 - 3.95 L
  * P/S - 100 mL
  * FBS - 2 L
  * L-Glutamin (check if needed to add)

Item and reagent list

  * Carboy 
  * Tubing 
  * 250 mL, 500 mL 1L corning bottles
  * Filter unit
  * Peristaltic pump or vacuum pump 
  * Tweezers 
  * 1 x Serological

  

Method:

  1.  Autoclave 10L carboy
  2. Transfer Carboy into BSC and remove any excess water inside the carboy 
  3. Add reagents into the carboy and mix 
  4. Attach serological to tubing  (make sure to remove cotton bud with tweezers) and place inside the carboy 
  5.  Filter into 250 mL, 500 mL and 1L plastic corning bottles: 
    1. 'MilliporeSigma™ Stericap™ PLUS Sterile Bottle-Top Filter Device': Use a vacuum to filter 
    2. Sartorius filter cap - Use a peristaltic pump 

Notes:

250 mL = 300 mL GM (For feeds)

500 mL = 600 mL GM (for seeding)

1L = spare (for lab and cell count)




PBS

2L.

1\. Added 19.2g dPBS to a 2L Schotte bottle with 2L MilliQ water.  
2\. Poured 200ul into 10x small Schotte bottles  
3\. Autoclaved.




Tryple

Added 85.44g of dPBS powder to 2L MiliQ water to disolve (1L was not enough to
disolve the dPBS). I later realise that we only had enough tryple stock to
make up 8L total so I used 1.6L of the 2L mix in the total of 8L, giving 68.5g
dPBS powder used (9.6g/L).  

Proposed method for tryple (8 L)

  * Reagents (8L)
  * Tryple - 0.8 L 
  * dPBS - 68.5 g 
  * MilliQ - 7.2 L
  * EDTA (100 mM) - 80 mL 

Method

  1. Autoclave schott bottles, 1L and 2L bottles. (provide guide? - caps on loosely, do not move glass bottles when they are still warm (will cause thermal shock), only tighten cap when the bottle has cooled down (to prevent shattering)) 
  2. Weight out 85.44g of dPBS powder in a 2L schott bottle.
  3. Add 2L of MilliQ to dissolve dPBS, making sure there are no lumps  
  4. Transfer content into a 1.6L to carboy. 
  5. Add 5.52L of MilliQ into the carboy. 
  6. Stir carboy well, making sure that all the PBS is dissolved and mixed homogeneously. 
  7. Add tryple and EDTA into carboy and mix well. 
  8. Transfer carboy into the BSC 
  9. Filtered Tryple using 1L filter units and distributed amongst 1L and 500ml storage bottles
  10. Stored at Cell expansion workspace.
