RELATED TO MILESTONE:   Non KR related.

AIM/PURPOSE: To expand the initially isolated NANDO cells to generate a
working cell bank of NANDO fibroblasts.

HYPOTHESIS: NANDO cells will proliferate in standard culture allowing us to
bank a MCB of >10M cells and a WCB of  >20M cells.

RESULTS SUMMARY: 11M cells were banked as an MCB. Expansion from MCB to WCB
was terminated after P6 (D14) due to the apparent senescence of cells.

NEXT STEPS: The reason for the cell death after p6 is unclear. The expansion
from MCB to WCB will be repeated to determine if this was an anomaly.
