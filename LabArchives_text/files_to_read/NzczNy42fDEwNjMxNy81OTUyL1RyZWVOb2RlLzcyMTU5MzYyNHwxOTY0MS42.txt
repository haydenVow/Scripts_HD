Aim/Purpose


To assess whether the feeding schedule of BUFFY6 cells in differentiation will
affect their regulation of MyoG (transcription factor expressed in myogenic
differentiation) and production of myosin heavy chain (structural protein
produced by fused muscle cells within myotubes).  
To verify findings from Addy/Eva's experiments (See Report 1 and Report 2)


Hypothesis


That 100% feeds daily in E6 may be detrimental to myogenic differentiation, as
seen in this experiment, and that differentiation can be enhanced with less
regular feeds that replaced a smaller proportion of the supernatant (<100%).  
This is also a training experiment for Andrew and Varshana, therefore this
experimental design should allow both JRSs to become accustomed to MuSC
culture processes including:

  * Thawing MuSCs
  * Seeing MuSCs evenly across culture-ware
  * Feeding MuSCs with media containing 10uM p38i
  * Harvesting MuSCs with Tryple
  * Counting MuSCs on a hemocytometer
  * Seeding MuSCs into multi-well plates
  * Preparing E6 and 2% HS differentiation media
  * Performing differentiation feeds in 96-well plates with a manual multi-channel pipette
  * Fixing cells with Paraformaldehyde
  * Performing the immunofluorescence staining protocol (permeabilising, blocking, primary antibody staining, secondary antibody staining, DAPI staining, washing)
  * Imaging IF stained cells on the Zaber (3 fluorescent channels)
  * Running image files through ImageJ macros (already designed and existing) - * PERHAPS SOME TROUBLESHOOTING HERE DEPENDING ON RESULTS
  * Putting the qualitative data information into digestible graphs
  * Publishing a report with an in depth discussion around the results, and a straightforward conclusion.


Technical Gap
Method/Procedure

  1. [Experiment Plan]
    * Get cells ready and grow them in growth media [Addy, Andrew, Varshana]
      1. D-7 Gelatin-coating of 3 x T175 at 37 C for 1h 
      2. Make up 90mL DMEM/F12 + 20% FBS + 1xP/S \+ 10uM P38i and warm it up in the water bath
      3. Collect 1 cryovial of BUFFY6 WCB MuSC cells (1 vial contains 500K cells) and thaw by placing it in a foam floater in water bath (as per SOP)  

      4. In the BSC, add 0.5ml of DMEM/F12 + 20% FBS + 1xP/S + 10mM P38i growth media into the vial containing the thawed cells  

      5. Add the vial containing the cells into 90ml of pre-warmed, fresh DMEM/F12 + 20% FBS + 1xP/S + 10uM P38i growth media and mix using a pipette
      6. Pipette 30ml into each of the T175 
      7. D -6 Feed cells with 50% DMEM/F12 + 20% FBS + 1xP/S + 10mM P38i (always add P38i when media will be used). This is remove 15 of the 30 ml in each of the flasks and add 15 ml of fresh media.
    * Passage cells and feeding [Addy, Andrew, Varshana] 
      1. D -4 Gelatin coating of 6 x 96 wp at 37 C for at least 1h
      2. Add trypLE to 3 x T175 and centrifuge
      3. Aspirate the supernatant and resuspend the pellet in pre-warmed, fresh growth media
      4. Cell count and aliquot the required volume to pre-warmed growth media so that each of the wells in the 96 wp has 640 cells/well
      5. D -2 50% Feed cells with Growth media \+ 10uM P38i 
    * Differentiation assay [Bec, Andrew, Varshana]
      1. D0 Change the media to either E6 or DMEM/F12 + 2% HS according to the image below and fix plate day 0:   

      2. Wednesday D1: Feed daily wells (3 x 96 wp)
      3. Thursday D2: Feed all wells (3 x 96wp)
      4. Friday D3: Feed daily wells (3 x 96wp)
      5. Saturday D4: Feed all wells (2 x 96wp) and fix plate day 4 
      6. Sunday D5: Feed daily wells (2 x 96wp)
      7. Monday D6: Feed all wells (2 x 96wp)
      8. Tuesday D7: Feed daily wells (1 x 96wp) and fix plate day 7
      9. Wednesday D8: Feed all wells (1 x 96wp)
      10. Thursday D9: Feed daily wells (1 x 96wp)
      11. Friday D10: Fix plate day 10
    * Fixing, staining, image, analyse protocol
      1. Remove differentiation media
      2. Wash 2 x with PBS
      3. Fix with PFA 
      4. Wash 2 x with PBS
      5. Permeabilise with PBS/Triton (Triton is a detergent) 
      6. Wash 2x with PBS
      7. Block 
      8. IF stain (antibody): primary stain with anti-MyoG and anti-MF20
      9. Secondary antibody stain
      10. Zaber imaging
      11. Analysis (ImageJ macros)
