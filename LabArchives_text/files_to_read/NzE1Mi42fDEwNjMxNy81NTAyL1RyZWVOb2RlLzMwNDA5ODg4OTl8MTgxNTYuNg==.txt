### Process:

1\. Took image of vessel with microscope on phase setting.

2\. Aliquotted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then
placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath for a minimum of 20 minutes
prior to use:

  1. TrypLE:     200  mL in 2x 250 mL jar
  2.  dPBS (for neutralising):     200    mL
  3.  dPBS (for washing):      200   mL
  4. Growth media (for pellet resuspension):     20    mL
  5. Growth media (for seeding):    600   mL D/F + 10% FBS  
                                                 600  mL D/F + 20% FBS

Time that all aliquots were placed in the water bath the warm before use
16:34

Note: if aliquots were placed in water bath at different time, record the time
stamp for each individual solution.




4\. Removed vessel(s) from the incubator

5\. Washed the vessel(s) with 100 mL dPBS (warmed).

6\. Added       100  mL tryple to each vessel/well and incubated at 37˚C.

  1. Start/Finish for TrypLE was  16:42 - 16:52 (CHOMP), 16:48 - 16:59 (DOLLY)   

7\. Neutralised with  100 mL dPBS and combined cell suspension into 8 x 50 mL
tubes  

8\. Centrifuged at 650 x g for 5 min.

  1. Start/Finish time for centrifugation was     17:11-17:16   




9\. Aspirated the supernatant(s).

10\. Resuspended pellet(s) in   1  mL     growth     media and pooled into 1x
50 mL tube.

11\. Topped up tube to 10 mL with growth media.  

11\. Aliquoted  100 uL of resuspended cells into a microcentrifuge tube for
cell count.

12\. Performed a cell count using the haemocytometer and recorded the cell
count data in the Google Doc spreadsheet: Cell Count Spreadsheet or cell count
widget below

  1. Total cell number was:       9095: 43,120,000  
9096:  

  2. Volume of cell suspension required for subculture was:      DOLLY12: 4100uL to 4CF, 400 uL to 10x T25  
CHOMP: 4.4 mL to 4CF  

  3. Cell density per vessel:      7500   




13\. Transferred    4100  µl of DOLLY cell suspension to the pre-warmed   600
mL Growth media (D/F + 10% FBS) and transferred to 4CF.

14\. Transferred 8 uL of DOLLY suspension to the pre-warmed 30mL Growth media
(D/F + 10% FBS) and transferred to T175

15\. Transferred 4.4 mL of CHOMP cell suspension to 600 mL of pre-warmed
Growth media (D/F + 20% FBS) and transferred to 2CF. The remaining CHOMP and
DOLLY cell suspensions were given to Kylie for use.  

16\. Transferred vessel(s) to incubate at: 18:09

  * [ ]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * [ ]  30ºC, 5% CO2 (reptilian cells)
