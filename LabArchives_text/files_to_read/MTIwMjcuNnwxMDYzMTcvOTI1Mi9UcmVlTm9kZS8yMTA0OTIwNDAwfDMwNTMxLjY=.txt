Why? Accountability and so the reader/reviewer knows who to address in follow
up comments and questions.


Protocol followed


List the protocol used, broken down into sequential steps (using appropriate
templates), as well as any changes made to the protocol.

Include plate maps/diagrams, as well as any relevant widgets or calculators.

Note - Timestamps are not necessary but are encouraged on critical time
sensitive steps, such as fixation and staining with antibodies.  

Why? Having a clear step-by-step protocol for the lab user to follow will
reduce chance of error such as accidentally missing out steps. Timestamps on
critical steps act as a reminder to the user, and provide a good reference in
instances when a protocol fails e.g. if fixing and staining of a sample did
not work we can come back to the timestamps to ensure that timings were
accurate, if they were accurate we can assume that the timings need to be
adjusted or that the consumables or samples themselves were at fault.
