## Process

Artificial UVB irradiation

  1. Labelled plates according to how much irradiation they are receiving 

  2. Set up UVB lamp inside BSC

    1. Checked UV reading on UV meter at ~10 cm from lamp (used N50 pen to measure rough distance) 0.36 mW/cm2

  3. Placed Growth Medium aliquots (prepared in previous lab book entry) in water bath at 30'C 14:12

  4. Aliquted 50 mL of sterile, RT dPBS.   

  5. Brought plates one at a time into BSC, starting with plate 1. 

  6. For each plate:

    1. Removed growth medium and washed with 1 mL dPBS. Replaced with 1 mL fresh dPBS.

    2. Placed plate on frozen ice block

    3. Placed plate ~10 cm from lamp and turned on light.

  7. Exposed plate 1 to UV for 12.5 seconds (5 mj/cm^2).

    1. Replaced dPBS with fresh, warmed growth medium + 100 ng/mL FGF-B and IGF-2

  8. Exposed plate 2 to UV for 37.84 seconds (15 mj/cm^2).

    1. Replace dPBS with fresh, warmed growth medium \+ 100 ng/mL FGF-B and IGF-2

  9. Exposed plate 3 to UV for ~~75~~ 71 seconds (30 mj/cm^2).

    * Replace dPBS with fresh, warmed growth medium \+ 100 ng/mL FGF-B and IGF-2

  10. Exposed plate 4 to UV for 150 seconds (60 mj/cm^2). 
    * Replace dPBS with fresh, warmed growth medium \+ 100 ng/mL FGF-B and IGF-2

  11. Wrapped half of Plate 5 with parafilm then foil to sterilely block UV light from 4 control wells 
  12. Exposed plate 5 to UV for 750 seconds (300 mj/cm^2).

    * Replaced dPBS with fresh, warmed growth medium \+ 100 ng/mL FGF-B and IGF-2  
  
  
P53i treatment  
  
  

  13. Labelled wells according to which concentration of P53i they are receiving

  14. Brought plates into BSC. 

  15. Replaced growth medium in treatment wells with varying concentrations of P53i supplemented fresh growth medium + 100 ng/mL FGF-B and IGF-2

  16. Replaced growth medium in P53i control wells with DMSO supplemented growth medium + 100 ng/mL FGF-B and IGF-2

  17. Replaced growth medium in "ultimate control" wells with fresh growth medium + 100 ng/mL FGF-B and IGF-2 (no P53i, no DMSO)

  18. Replaced in incubator at 30'C 5%CO2 




Observation

  * No precipitate observed immediately following media change to P53 inhibitor.
