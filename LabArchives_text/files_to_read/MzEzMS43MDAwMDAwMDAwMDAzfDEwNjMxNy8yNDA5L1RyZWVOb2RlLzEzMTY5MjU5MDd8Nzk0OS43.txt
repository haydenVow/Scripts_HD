Aim/Purpose


To screen 12 media components/factors, which have previously been associated
with differentiation in literature and internal studies. Specifically, this
experiment aims to look at the impact of adding these factors to our E6 media
after the cells have been proliferated in standard growth media. Combinations
of these factors at various 'levels' will make up 26 different media
conditions/formulations.


Hypothesis


Analysis based on MyoG and/or MF20 expression will identify at least 2
factors/media formulations that significantly enhance differentiation relative
to E6 alone.


Technical Gap


Based on a metabolite study and literature we have identified several
promising factors, which can be viewed here. However, we have not yet
investigated the effects of these metabolites in combination with our baseline
E6 media to improve differentiation and maturation.

Day 3: Prepare 6mL 30x E6 bullet (need 5.4mL)

  1. Combine the following ingredients in a 15 mL tube:
    * 115.2 uL LAA2P
    * 34.9 uL insulin
    * 25.2 uL sodium selenium
    * 19.26 uL transferrin
  2. Bring total amount to 6mL by adding 5,805 uL DMEM/F12.
  3. Store at 4 degrees C if using on the same day. Otherwise, store at -20 degrees C.




Day 3: Create DSD mixed conditions with OT2

Preparing reagents:

  1. Prepare the following reagents:
    * `33.75 mL `DMEM
    * `33.75 mL`  F12
    * `0.144 mL` P/S
    * `39.12 mg` sodium bi-carbonate powder
    * `5.4 mL` 30X E6 bullet
  2. Filter through 0.2um filter unit/syringe.
  3. Any reconstitution buffers identified in this experiment's pipeline calculator (i.e H2O, ethanol, DMSO - filtered)

Reconstituting factors:

  1. Reconstitute factors to make concentrated stocks.  See spec sheet for reconstitution instructions for each factor, as reconstitution protocols, reconstitution buffer and storage conditions may differ.
    * Example protocol:
      1. Centrifuge vial containing powdered factor for 10 seconds
      2. Bring factor to recommended reconstitution concentration by adding the recommended reconstitution buffer to vial and mix thoroughly via pipetting solution up and down 5-10 times within the vial.
      3. Make 20uL aliquots of the concentrated stock, placing in a 2mL micro-centrifuge snap tube labeled with the factor's name, concentration, date, and your initials.
      4. Store unused aliquots at -20C.

Preparing working stocks:

  1. Refer to the "Factor Calcs" tab of your pipeline calculator to find uL amounts of `"DMEM/F12"` and concentrated stock needed to create a working stock for each factor.
  2. Label 13 sterile 15 mL falcon tubes as follows: "[Factor name] - working stock". In each tube, place the designated amount of DMEM/F12 as in the "factor calcs" tab of the excel spreadsheet.
  3. Next, add the uL amount of `concentrated stock` for each factor to the stock plate using the same arrangement as above.
  4. Use a syringe filter to sterile filter each condition

DSD mixing protocol on OT2:

  1. Add `13.5 mL` of `"DMEM/F12"` to wells 1 to 5 of a 12 well reservoir.
  2. Add 4.8 `mL` of 30x E6 bullet to A5 of the stock tube rack.
  3. Place the tip racks, falcon tube racks and media reservoir in the starting deck state below.
  4. Immediately prior to running the OT2 mixing protocol, use a multichannel pipette to thoroughly mix the working stocks by pipetting the solutions up and down 5-10 times within their respective wells.  DO NOT MIX THE WORKING STOCKS WITH EACH OTHER.
  5. Prepare two other tube racks with 15 sterile 15 mL falcon tubes (total 30 tubes) labelled "Condition [1-26]" or "control [1-4]".
    1. The final layout should resemble the "Layout" tab in the excel spreadsheet.
  6. Run the following OT2 mixing protocol to make DSD conditions: '2021_07_21_DSD_media_mixing.py'
  7. Manually create extra controls: All controls will be ~4.43mL final volume 
    1. Control 1: E6 media control. Mix 148 uL E6 30X bullet with 4.28 mL DMEM/F12
    2. Control 2: E6 media control. Mix 148 uL E6 30X bullet with 4.28 mL DMEM/F12
    3. Control 3 is E6 with 0.04% v/v ethanol reconstitution buffer control. Mix 1.9 uL ethanol with 148 uL E6 30X bullet with 4.28 mL DMEM/F12
    4. Control 4 is E6 with 0.01% v/v HCl reconstitution buffer control. Mix 0.5 uL 0.5 M HCl with 148 uL E6 30X bullet with 4.28 mL DMEM/F12
  

  8. Place the labelled controls in the leftover slots of tube rack #3 (shown below). They will be re-ordered for the plate randomization step.
  9. Store  these racks in the fridge (4° C).

input vessel (tube rack #1, working stocks) and output vessels (Tube racks #2
and #3). Note that controls must be made up manually. These conditions must be
re-ordered for the next randomization step, shown below.  


  
  
Day 3: Plate randomisation on OT2

  1. Set up OT2 as follows:
    1. Opentrons 96 filter tip rack (1000 uL) on Position 11
    2. Working stock racks (with 26 conditions + 4 controls) on positions 4 and 7, respectively
    3. Deep 96-wp labelled 'Block1' and 'Block2' in positions 5 and 8, respectively
    4. 12-well reservoir with wells 1-4 filled with 13.5 mL sterile PBS on position 9
  2. Run the OT2 protocol for plate randomisation: "2021_07_15_12factor_DSD_Plate _Randomization.json"
  3. This will create randomised 'Storage plates' (blocks 1 and 2) which will hold the DSD condition media in deep wells for further experiments. These plates can then be transferred to the 96-wp with cells, with media changes every day. Note that wells surrounding these will be filled with PBS.

2 and 3 are made up of conditions previously mixed using the OT. The layout of
conditions from the DSD mixing has to be modified to match that on the right
for this step.  
  
Figure 6: The final deck state after the plate randomisation protocol has been
run on the OT. The exact positions of each factor are shown on the right. The
groups of four conditions on the input plates represents one 15mL falcon tube.  
  
  




Day 3: Switch to DSD differentiation media

  1. Warm the storage plates in the incubator for 20 minutes prior to treating the cells.
  2. Aspirate the growth media using a multi-channel pipette
  3. Transfer 140 uL from each condition to the corresponding location on the cell plate (i.e. A1 goes into A1 on the cell plate etc).
  4. Return the cell plates to the incubator and the storage plates to the fridge




Days 1-14 of diff: 100% feed with DSD conditions  

  

  1. Remake DSD media on days 4, 7, 10 using the DSD randomisation step (see above)
  2. Warm storage plates 1 and 2 in the incubator for at least 20 minutes before use.
  3. Perform the following steps for each column containing cells for all 3 plates, changing tips between columns.
  4. Using a multi-channel pipette slowly aspirate and discard 140uL of media from a column (starting with culture plate 1, column 2).
  5. Slowly add 1400uL/well warm diff media from corresponding wells of the stock plate (i.e. from storage plate 1 column 2 into culture plate 1 column 2 and so on).
  6. Return plates to incubator at 37 degrees, 5% CO2.
