Operator: Shaleen/Adem/Alex

Kitchen/yurt lab:

  1. Spray the body of the sacrificed lobster liberally with 70% EtOH.
  2. Collect 5 x muscle samples (3-5g) from the location shown in Figure 1.   11:08 pm
  3. Rinse samples with iodine solution and incubate at RT for 5 mins.   11:10 - 11:15  pm
  4. Dab iodine soaked samples dry with sterile gauze.
  5. Spray samples with 70% EtOH and dab dry with sterile gauze.
  6. Collect three samples (that are outside the BSC) and place samples in the fridge at 4°C. 

In BSC:

  1. Transfer three samples into the BSC and into 2 x falcon tubes containing 20mL of PBS + 1X P/S.  
  2. Perform one wash with PBS + 1X P/S.
  3. Pipette 10ml of basal media into 2 x  100mm petri dishes.
  4. Place both samples into each petri dish and mince samples into 0.1mm - 5mm sections.

1\. Gelatin coated 4 x 6 well plates. 10:03am

Outgrowth protocol:

  1. Transfer minced tissue from one petri dish onto sterile gauze briefly to dry the tissue from basal media.
  2. Split minced tissue into each condition well as outlined in Figure 3 above.

Place the dishes containing L-15 media into the incubator set to 0% CO2 and
the remaining petri dishes into an incubator set to 20°C.

Enzymatic digestion protocol:

  1. Transfer the minced tissue from the other petri dish to a 50ml falcon tube containing 50ml DMEM/F12 + Collagenase/Dispase (50:50).
  2. Incubate for 1 hour, 20°C with optional agitation in the water bath. 11:57am
  3. Pass cell suspension through a 70uM cell strainer and split suspension into 1 x 50ml falcon tubes 
  4. Centrifuge tubes at 1000g for 5 min.  14 :02 - 14:07 pm   

  5. Wash the cell pellets once with 25mL Wash Media (DMEM/F12+ 1XP/S)
    1. Centrifuge at 1000 x g for 5 min in between washes. 14 : 12 - 14:17 pm  
*The supernatant should appear clear after the last wash.
      1. NOTE: Pellet was very weakly packed - needs high spin speed and longer spins
      2. NOTE: At 500g cells did not pellet - Could be cell density/weight?
  6. Aspirate supernatant from pellet.
  7. Resuspend pellet with 2ml of each respective media type.
  8. Take small aliquots of each cell suspension and observe under haemocytometer to gauge cell density.
  9. Transfer    200  uL of each cell suspension into 3mL of each room temperature growth media . Mix well.
  10. Seed each cell suspension as per Figure 3 above, and place in incubator at 20°C, 5% CO2 (except for L-15 media dishes). (parafilmed around the edges)   2:45 pm
