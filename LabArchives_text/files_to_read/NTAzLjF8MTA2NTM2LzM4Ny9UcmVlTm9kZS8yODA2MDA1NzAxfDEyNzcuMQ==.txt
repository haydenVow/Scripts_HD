Experimental Plan:

  




Procedure

1\. Turn on the water bath and set to 37'C.  
2\. Aliquot required growth media into a sterile container/s and add the
required treatment:

Bottles 1 & 2:  
i) Vitamin C (aka LAA2P) [stock concentration 100mg/mL] to a working
concentration of 50ug/mL in growth media i.e. 500uL per 1L of media.  
     
Bottles 3-7:  
i) Vitamin C (aka LAA2P) [stock concentration 100mg/mL] to a working
concentration of 50ug/mL in growth media i.e. 500uL per 1L of media.  
ii) TGF-b1 [stock concentration 0.002mg/L] to a working concentration of
10ng/mL in growth media i.e. 5mL per 1L of media.  

3\. Place in the water bath and heat for at least 20 minutes.  
4\. Observe the cell flasks for confluence under the microscope using 4 x
magnification and take images as required.  
5\. Transfer flasks to the BSC and remove required volume of media from each
flask (according to the Table below).  
6\. Replace the same volume into each flask with the prepared growth media.  
7\. Return the flasks to the incubator.

  
  

* Roller Bottles (R850) require 200mL for a 100% change and 100mL for a 50% change

Observations:  
  
Set 1: 100% confluence

Set 2: 85% confluent (definitely a different type of cellular organisation -
circular patterns ?)

Set 3: 70% confluent (a little patchy in areas)

Set 4: 95-100% confluent

Set 5: 95-100% confluent

Set 6: Started peeling. 100% confluent, will harvest today.

Set 7: More peeling, will be harvested today.


Set 3 & 4 - 50% Feed
Set 1 & 2 - 50% Feed with Vit C
Set 5 - 50% Feed with Vit C + TGF-b
