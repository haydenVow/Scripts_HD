Cell count

  1. Drew 1mL cell suspension from flasks using 5mL serelogical pipette and dispensed into 1.5mL tube
  2. Performed 1:2 dilution using Trypan blue and counted using haemocytometer
  3. Drew 500uL cell suspension and deposited into Vicell consumable. Counted using 'Nuvonis suspension' preset protocol
  4. Recorded counts in spreadsheet here   




Process:

  1. Used serelogical pipette to dispense 20mL into 50mL falcon tube x9 tubes total, and labelled 1-9
  2. Drew 3x 200uL from top of falcon tube and deposited in 96-well for each sample (see plate map below)
  3. Used tablet to image tubes before additions
  4. Added the following buffers to the following tubes:
    1. No additions
    2. +200uL of 1% acetic acid solution
    3. +200uL from tube D
    4. +200uL from 1.3
    5. +200uL from 1.2
    6. +200uL from 1.1
    7. +200uL from 2.3
    8. +200uL from 2.2
    9. +200uL from 2.1
  5. Set timer for 5 and 30 minutes
  6. At each time point, drew 200ul and deposited in 96-well plate. imaged tubes with tablet and drew 500uL sample and deposited into Vicell consumable for counting
