Aim: To characterise the DO and pH levels in our perfusion bioreactor at
normoxia (5% CO2)

Preparation:

After consulting with Tom, it was found that setting the CO2 rotameter to 20
and the Air rotameter to 100 should result in normoxic conditions in the
culture medium (5% CO2).

  1. Spare growth media from Production was used. This included 750mL of Phenol-red containing Growth Media (10% FBS) and 750mL of PRF Growth Media (20% FBS). It was decided that in order to mimic our growth conditions as much as possible, 750mL of media containing 20% FBS would be used first and then topped up with 10% FBS containing media until desired volume for probe submersion was achieved.
  2. 750mL of each media type was used to make up the 1.5L of media inside Wash-E.
  3. All 1.5L of media was used to make total working volume of 1.5L inside Wash-E
  4. Lid of Wash-E was closed and all probes attached.
  5. Gas was sparged in with the CO2 rotameter set to 20 and the Air rotameter set to 80.
  6. Medium was allowed to come to 37.5 degrees temperature.
  7. Readings were taken every fifteen minutes once culture medium had reached 37.5 degrees.
