Process:

Make 2xaliquots for each of the media below with volumes as indicated (4
aliquots altogether). Add 100ng/mL of FGF, IGF1, and PDGF to each of the
aliquots by using stock reagents as shown in the table below. This media will
be used for feeds today immediately.

RPMI + 20% KSR (Mix ID: 7400): 15.5 mL and 10.5 mL  

CD-CHO + 20% KSR (Mix ID: 7682): 15.5 mL and 10.5 mL

  

  

Reagent IDs of stock:

FGFb: m5077

IGF1-LR3:  m7681

PDGF-BB: m7680




Observations/Summary:

Added growth factors to aliquots of each of these media:
