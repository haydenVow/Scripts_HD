RELATED TO MILESTONE:  NA/ Non-KR

AIM/PURPOSE: To expand the plastic adherent population of CHOMP09 raw
homogenate to generate a working cell bank of >10M cells.

HYPOTHESIS: Culture of CHOMP09 homogenate will allow for the expansion of a
plastic adherent population of cells to >10M cells within 2 weeks.

RESULTS SUMMARY: The hypothesis was not supported. The plastic adherent
population of cells was not able to be expanded to >10M cells due to the
failure of the cells to re-attach to the vessel after their 2nd passage. The
reason for this sudden cell death is unknown.

An interesting finding was that initial attachment of cells to the culture
vessel was not observed until day 13 after seeding isolate.

CONCLUSIONS: It is unclear why these cells suddenly died. The most probable
causes for this cell loss include undetected changes in the incubator
temperature, humidity or CO2 levels, possible micro plasma contamination, or
spoiled media reagents such as PBS.

NEXT STEPS:  Another vial of CHOMP09 homogenate should be expanded in order to
determine if the sudden cell death  was an anomaly or the downstream result of
isolate cryopreservation.
