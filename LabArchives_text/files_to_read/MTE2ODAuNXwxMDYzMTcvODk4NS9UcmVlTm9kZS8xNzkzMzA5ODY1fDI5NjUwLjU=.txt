FS1  
Feed with 2 g/L glucose & 2 mM ala-gln every 48h from D3 onwards (inclusive of
D3). Exclusively on D3, Ala-gln will be topped up with 3mM. Main lab, #159

Process
  
  
  1. Retrieved a random selection of 10 x E125s from the incubator and transferred to BSC
  2. Transferred 510 uL samples from each flask into ViCell counting cups
  3. Returned flasks to incubator
  4. Loaded carousel with cups for counts 
  5. Repeated steps 1-4 twice more with remaining flasks in a batch of 10, then 8.




Performed later

  1. Took 1 x 100 uL sample from flasks in FS4 and FS5 (flasks #13-20) 
  2. Performed glucose test using Diastix Urine Glucose Test Strips
  3. Recorded observed glucose reading in table attached below 
  4. If any flasks appear to be in the 2.5-5 g/L range, added glucose and ala-gln according to feeding schedule condition

13FS45-10Only had 100 uL sample, hence the half-coloured strip results. Based
on our reference image from our in-house calibration (attached at bottom on
lab book), the darker brown colour suggests a reading of 5-10 g/LN/AN/A
