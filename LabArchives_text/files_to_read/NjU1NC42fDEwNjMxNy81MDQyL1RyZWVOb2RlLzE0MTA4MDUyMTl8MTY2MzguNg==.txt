Aim/Purpose


Cells did not adhere in a previous experiment due to lack of attachment sites.
In this study we aim to identify a suitable matrix for cells to adhere and
differentiate inside alginate hydrogels.


Hypothesis


A combination of gel stiffness and ECM binding sites can provide encapsulated
cells with a suitable environment to promote adhesion and differentiation.


Technical Gap


There may be additional reasons why cells did not adhere inside Alginate gels
(e.g. stiffness, oxygen/nutrient starvation towards bead core). We have not
explored hybrid hydrogels for cell encapsulation before.


Method/Procedure


## Study setup:

  1. Cell expansion of C2C12s
  2. Preparation of materials (Alginate, CaCl2, Gelatin, Collagen, laminin etc)
  3. Day 0: Cell harvest and seeding into gel matrices in "meatballs" vs non-cell-laden control samples (see platemap below)
  4. Day 1: 100% GM feed, may help the cells establish themselves better and potentially even proliferate before the switch to Diff media
  5. Day 2: switch media to E6 and start differentiation
  6. Day 3: assess viability using CMFDA or MTT assay for half of each sample sacrificed other half fix (and stain with Day6 samples) , 100% feed
  7. Day 4: 100% feed
  8. Day 5: 100% feed
  9. Day 6: 100% feed
  10. Day 7: assess maturity of muscle using (immunostaining and) total protein quant.




## Materials Prep

Preparation of 4% Alginate solution: from previous study

Preparation of 100mM CaCl2: from previous study

Gelatin 4% in DMEM:

  1.  dissolve 0.4g Gelatin in 10 mL DMEM/F12
  2. sterile filter

Laminin: dilute stock 150uL into 350uL media

Collagen: dilute PureColl EZ gel stock 100uL into 400uL media




## Encapsulation of cells

  1. centrifuge ~100M cells and resuspend in growth media to a total max volume of XXX mL       time    
  2. Prepare cell suspensions in alginate at varying loading densities:
  3. TABLE WITH MIXES HERE
  4.  Prepare cell free alginate gel only and dispense first:   time    

  5. using a P200 for each condition, produce gel droplets at the pipette tip and drop into a Calcium bath (1.5mL in 24wp well) from a close distance (to avoid deformation and maintain spherical shape). 5 "meatballs" per well only to allow for sufficient media to feed the encapsulated cells
  6.  Gelation will occur within 2 minutes, but allow approximately 5 minutes for firm gel formation.
  7. Transfer all inserts to a new plate preloaded with 1.5 mL media (wash 1) for 2 min
  8. Transfer all inserts to a new plate preloaded with 1.5mL media (wash 2) for 2 min
  9. Transfer all inserts to a new plate preloaded with 1.5 mL media
  10. Put plate in incubator
