### Process:

1\. Took images of vessels with microscope on phase setting, 4x objective
before passage

2\. Aliquotted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then
placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath for a minimum of 20 minutes
prior to use:

  1. TrypLE:     54    mL in     1 x 70 ml     urine pot
  2.  dPBS (for neutralising):     54    mL
  3.  dPBS (for washing):     54   mL

Aliquots were warmed up in the bead bath set at 37 degrees C for 15 minutes.




4\. Removed vessel(s) from the incubator

5\. Removed the supernatant then washed the vessel(s) with dPBS (warmed)
(6mL/vessel),

6\. Added     6    mL tryple to each vessel, incubated for 8 minutes at 30
degrees, 5% CO2.

7\. Neutralised with     6 mL    dPBS and combined cell suspension into 9 x 15
ml tubes.  

8\. Centrifuged at 400 x g for 5 min.




9\. Aspirated the supernatant(s).

10\. Resuspended pellet(s) in     1    mL    growth    media.  

11\. Added the 1 ml cell suspension of each clone into the 30 ml of growth
media previously poured into 9 x T175.




  

16\. Transferred vessel(s) to incubate at:

  * [x]  30ºC, 5% CO2 CHOMP cells, incubator 140
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (avian cells)

Version Change Log

NameChange Details  
V1 (original)N/A  
V2Changed all sentences to past tense to better reflect a hand-written lab
book entry.  
Various formatting changes.  
Addition of more detail to step 2, removal of step 3. Replaced volume
requirements table with updated volumes @Sep 22, 2020  
Updated temperature selection for mammalian/aviary cells @Sep 23, 2020  
V3Included a section for 'vessel type' in passage ID table Replace
'flask/plate' with 'vessel' throughout lab book Include at step 1 to take
image of vessel on the microscope  
Mentioned that dPBS for washing should be warm - step 3(2) and 5.  
Added timepoint at step 4 for when vessel is removed from incubator  
Include at step 11 to aliquot cell resuspension into microcentrifuge tube  
Included at step 10 and 13 time point for when cell pellet is resuspended and
when resuspended cells is moved into growth media.  
Included p38i in table of regent used  
Combined two dPBS entries in 'Media/reagents' table Added 'cell density per
vessel'
