Growth Media:

  * 'serum' = DMEM/F12 + 20% FBS + 1x P/S + 10uM p38i
  * E810C
  * E810C no GABA
  * E810C + extra ethanolamine and p38i
  * E810C + extra ethanolamine and p38i, no EGF, GABA, LIF

  




### Process:

1\. Took image of vessel with microscope on phase setting.

2\. Gelatin coated     5     x    T25      vessel with sterile filtered 0.1%
gelatin solution and then incubated all coated flasks at 37˚C.

  1. Time when all vessels(s) placed into the incubator       11: 20      

3\. Aliquotted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then
placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath for a minimum of 20 minutes
prior to use:

  1. TrypLE:     16    mL in     1    tubes  10 : 56   

  2.  dPBS (for washing and neutralising):      32   mL in    1    tubes 10 : 56 
  3. Growth media (for pellet resuspension and seeding):     6 mL of each condition   mL in   1      tube each 11 : 13   

Time that all aliquots were placed in the water bath is indicated for each
reagent^  

Note: if aliquots were placed in water bath at different time, record the time
stamp for each individual solution.




4\. Removed vessel(s) from the incubator

5\. Washed the vessel(s) with dPBS (warmed).

6\. Added    3mL/flask     tryple to each vessel/well and incubated at 37˚C.

  1. Start/Finish for TrypLE was     11:48-12:13 for ACF conditions, 11:48-12:08 for serum     

7\. Neutralised with     3mL/flask     dPBS and combined cell suspension into
a    1     tube for each condition.

8\. Centrifuged at 650 x g for 5 min.

  1. Start/Finish time for centrifugation was    12 : 27 - 12 : 32    




9\. Aspirated the supernatant(s).

10\. Resuspended pellet(s) in     0.1   mL      for ACF growth   media,   0.2
mL  for the serum cells.  

11\. Aliquoted       10uL   of resuspended cells into a microcentrifuge tube
for cell count.

12\. Performed a cell count using the haemocytometer and recorded the cell
count data in the Google Doc spreadsheet called 'Cell Count Spreadsheet' (see
link below):

SSIBtIylyrBQE5kRX5Z8NtI/edit#gid=0

  1.  Total cell number was:  
    1. serum: 54 400   

    2. E810C: 16 800   

    3. E810C no GABA: 11 200 
    4. E810C + extra ethanolamine and p38i: 8 800
    5. E810C + extra ethanolamine and p38i, no GABA, EGF, LIF:  10 800      

  2. Volume of cell suspension required for subculturing was:
    * serum: 92 uL (25 000 cells)   

    * E810C: all (100 uL)
    * E810C no GABA: all (100 uL)   

    * E810C + extra ethanolamine and p38i: all (100uL)
    * E810C + extra ethanolamine and p38i, no GABA, EGF, LIF: all (100 uL)
    *  
  3. Cell density per vessel:    1000cells/cm^2 - was only doable for serum condition      




13\. Transferred      volumes of cell suspensions indicated in step 12 into
5mL of respective warm growth media

14\. Transferred cell suspension into the pre-gelatin coated       T25
vessel.

15\. Left at RT in the BSC for 20 min to allow cells to settle     13 : 30 -
13:50 a/pm  

16\. Transferred vessel(s) to incubate at:

  * [X]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (avian cells)

Observations/Summary:

Passaged all conditions from 1x T25 to 1x T25

There was a very low amount of cell in ACF conditions compared to serum
