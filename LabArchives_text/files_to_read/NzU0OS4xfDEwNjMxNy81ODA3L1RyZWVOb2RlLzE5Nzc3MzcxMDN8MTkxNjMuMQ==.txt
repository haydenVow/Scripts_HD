Process

  1. Placed 12 mL of growth media in the water bath at 37C 12:00  
  

  2. Culture vessels removed from the incubator 12:10  
  

  3. Each vessel was examined under the microscope and imaged at 10x magnifications. Observations were recorded in the table bellow    
  

  4. Removed 50% of the media from each well.    
  
  

  5. Replaced with 1.5 mL of pre-warmed growth media.  
  

  6. Culture vessels returned to library lab incubator 77, 37C and 5% CO2  12:30
