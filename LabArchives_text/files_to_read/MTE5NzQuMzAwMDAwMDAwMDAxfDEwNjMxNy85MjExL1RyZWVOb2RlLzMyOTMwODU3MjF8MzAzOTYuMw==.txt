Base medium & controls prep
  
  
  1. Made up 1.8 L of sterile 50/50 RPMI/CHO medium with growth factors ("base medium")
    *   2. Transferred 90 mL of base medium to 3 x E125s (30 mL per flask)
  3. Transferred x mL of base media into 18 x 120 mL pots according to calculations attached (to come - Caelan will walk Lily through his new tool to do this calc)
  4. Parafilmed lids and moved to fridge to store overnight


Factor prep

  1. Located following reagents in lab (cross out when located):
    1. Human recombinant albumin
    2.  ~~Trace elements A~~
    3.  ~~Trace elements B~~
    4.  ~~IGF-1-LR3~~
    5.  ~~EGF~~
    6.  ~~Glycine~~
    7.  ~~Tyrosine~~
    8.  ~~Proline~~
    9.  ~~Valine~~
    10.  ~~Phenylalanine~~
    11.  ~~Leucine~~
    12.  ~~Threonine~~
    13.  ~~Methionine~~
    14.  ~~Asparagine~~
    15.  ~~Isoleucine~~
  2. Prepared amino acid mix 
    1. Weighed out each amino acid according to this sheet  (weigh out 1/4 of each weight listed to dissolve in 250 mL water)
    2. Add 250 mL ultra pure water to amino acid mix
    3. Dissolve using stir bar if necessary
    4. Sterile filter
    5. Store in fridge until needed

NOTE: amino acid solution did not dissolve entirely. JH suggested adjusting pH


Condition prep


  1. Brought all factor stock solutions into BSC along with 18 x base medium aliquots
  2. Added factors to each base medium aliquot according to calculations attached 
  3. Added conditions to 54 x E125s (30 mL per flask, 3 flasks per condition)
  4. Parafilmed lids and stored in fridge overnight
