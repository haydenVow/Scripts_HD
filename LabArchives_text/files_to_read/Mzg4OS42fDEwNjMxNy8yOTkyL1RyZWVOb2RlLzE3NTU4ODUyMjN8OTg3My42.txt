Encapsulation of cells process:

  1. Add sterile inserts into a sterile tray and place the tray onto a non-treated 24-well plate (see plate map below). Place lid ontop and parafilm. Place the plate with the tray and inserts into the fridge for a minimum of 30min before seeding   12:00    
  

  2. centrifuge 54M cells (26.912 mL) 14:21 - 14:26pm
  3. Prepare cell suspension (54 x 10^6 cells in 540ul of proliferation media, D/F +20% FBS + 1x P/S) and place in fridge at 4'C for a minimum of 10 minutes (~1hr max)   
  14:36  
 Prepare cell free media 180ul media only (D/F +20% FBS + 1x P/S)), and place
in the fridge at 4'C (minimum of 10 min)  
  12:00  
  
NOTE IMPORTANT\- If we cannot re-suspend 56M cells in only 540ul then re-
suspend the cells in 1.08mls of media (place in fridge). We would then add
this to 4.32ml of collagen suspension in step 4 (instead of 2.16ml of
collagen). In this scenario we would end up using ~5 ml of collagen overall
(including the collagen used for cell-free samples). In both scenarios we
would only use 180ul media + 720ul collagen for the cell free samples (n=3).
THIS SCENARIO WOULD GIVE US EXTRA GEL TO PLAY WITH AND WOULD ALLOW FOR EXTRA
CONICAL INSERTS TO BE USED IF WE HAVE THEM!  
  

  4. Remove PureCol® EZ Gel solution from 4°C storage (remove from fridge immediately prior to the next step). Add 2.16ml of the cold PureCol® EZ Gel solution into one sterile tube and 720ul of the PureCol® EZ Gel solution into a separate tube.  
  

  5. Add 540ul of the cold cell-media suspension to 2.16ml of cold PureCol® EZ Gel solution (ratio of 4:1 gel:cells, based on: https://advancedbiomatrix.com/purecol-ezgel.html) IF WE HAD TO RE-SUSPEND CELLS IN 1.08ml THEN ADD 4.32ml OF COLLAGEN (see note).     
 timestamp 15:10pm  
  

  6. Add 180ul of cold media only to the tube containing 720ul cold collagen (cell free samples)  
  timestamp 15:06 pm  

  7. Remove the 24 well plate from fridge and remove parafilm  
  

  8. Whilst the cell-gel and media-gel mix is still cold seed the inserts (IMPORTANT TO BE QUICK SO MIX STAYS COLD)   timestamp 15:14  
  
For anchor points: pipette 300ul per well around and between the insert legs
(n=3, see diagram below)  
For conical inserts: pipette 300ul per well around the perimeter trough of the
insert (n=3)  
For wells without inserts just add 300ul to the center of the well (n=3
samples)  
  
  
  

  9. Move the plate containing the gels into the incubator (37°C, 5% CO2)  timestamp 15:15 -15:47  Gelation will occur within 40 minutes, but allow approximately 60 to minutes for firm gel formation (should start almost immediately).  
  

  10. After 60 minutes (or until gel is firm can take up to 90 min) add pre-warmed proliferation media to each well (DMEM/F12 + 20% FBS + 1x P/S + p38i, enough media to fully immerse samples ~1.5mls per well)  timestamp 15:47  
Note - add media gently to the side of the well so as not to dislodge the gels
from the insert

### Results

  * Results were;
    * [ ]  As Usual (this is a repetitive task)
    * [ x]  Unexpected because...some bubbles occured when mixing the cold collagen with cell suspension
    * []  Need to be further analysed
    * [ ]  Other (.......)
