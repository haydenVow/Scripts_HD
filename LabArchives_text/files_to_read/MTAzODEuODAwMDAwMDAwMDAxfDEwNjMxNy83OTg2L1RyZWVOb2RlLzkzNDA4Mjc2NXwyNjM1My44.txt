Process:  

  1. Collected vessels from shaker, centrifuged for 5min at 400RPM
  2. Aspirated and discarded 5mL media from each tube (leaving 5mL)
  3. Using a 1mL pipette, re-suspended cell pellets in the remaining media. Note that this took a considerable amount of manual pipetting as there were several small clumps in all cultures.  
  4. Took 2x 10ul aliquot from each culture and performed trypan blue counts (see counts in table bellow).
  5. Discarded cultures, and terminated the experiment due to low cell numbers across the board.
