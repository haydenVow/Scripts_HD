50% Feed on 15x10CF, 1x4CF and 1x2CF


# Procedure - Feed

# Note: Fibroblasts do NOT require Gelatin coated Flasks, and do NOT require
p38i.  

  1. Turn on the water bath and set to 32'C.
  2. Aliquot  required growth media into a sterile container/s and place into the water bath. 
  3. Place in the water bath and heat for at least 20 minutes.
  4. Observe the cell flasks for confluence under the microscope using 4 x magnification and take images as required. Note: The confluence of cells must be <50% to perform cell feeding in P1-P3 and <80% in P4 prior to the cell differentiation stage. 
  5. Transfer flasks to the BSC and remove required volume of media from each flask (according to the Table below).
  6. Replace the same volume into each flask with the prepared growth media.
  7. Return the flasks to the incubators

Media used:  
ALQ-10193 DMEM aliquot  
ALQ-10182 DMEM/F12 + 20% FBS aliquot  
ALQ-10186 DMEM/F12 + 20% FBS aliquot  
ALQ-10191 DMEM aliquot  
ALQ-10197 DMEM aliquot  
ALQ-10195 DMEM aliquot  
ALQ-10178 DMEM/F12 + 20% FBS aliquot




### Deviation:  
  
During the imaging stage of the flasks for the 4CF and 2CF to observe the
confluence, the 4CF (Flask 10486) was observed to have a spindle-like strand
floating, yet stuck to the surface of the flask. Images were taken of this
suspicious structure.  
  
Immediate actions:

  1. Microscope images of the flask was taken. 
  2. The entire team was notified via walkie-talkie. 
  3. Flask ID '10486' was noted in the slack channel.
  4. Feeding of all other flasks occurred in the double BSC. 
  5. Flask 10486 was fed at the very end of the feeding session and performed in the single BSC. 
  6. CB suggested to collect waste media and store at ambient temperature. 
  7. SL suggested to label the waste media with batch number, flask number, date and time of collection.  'Batch 33 Waste Media (Flask 10486), 11/02/2022 Collected: 11:45am'
  8. The waste media was collected, labelled and stored at ambient temperature by AK. 

Further action:  
The ideal scenario would be to observe the media over a period of 2 weeks and
observe for any turbidity in the media.  
The waste media collected will be observed over a period of 4 days to observe
for any turbidity in the media.  
Due to the next passage of the flasks occurring on Tuesday, 4 days after
initial observation, a decision will need to be made by the team on the day
whether to proceed with the passage.
