Process

  1. Collected mini bioreactor tubes from shaker, wiped with ethanol-sprayed Rediwipe, and brought into BSC 
  2. Pipetted up and down with P1000 to ensure even distribution of cells
  3. Took 100 uL samples from each culture and transferred to separate wells in a 96-WP, recording the location of each sample for future plate mapping 
  4. Added 5 mL PBS
  5. centrifuged 5 mins 400g
  6. resuspended in 5 mL media
  7. moved to new mini bioreactor tube
  8. Placed mini bio reactor tubes to incubator

Staining

Prepare reagents

Prepared dead stain solution in amber/black centrifuge tube:  
\- 2 mL dPBS  

Prepared Hoechst stain (50 ug/mL) solution in amber/black centrifuge tube:  
\- 4750 uL MilliQ  
\- 250 uL Hoechst Trihydrochloride trihydrate (1mg/mL)  
Vortex for 5 seconds to mix. Solution can be stored at 4°C for up to 6 months

Stain plates

  1. Added 100 uL dPBS into plate columns 2 and 3 using a multichannel pipette
  2. Added 80 uL of dPBS to cells
  3. Stained samples with 20 uL of Hoechst stain solution
  4. Incubated for 30 minutes in the dark at room temperature 10:30- 11
  5. Serially diluted cell suspension by transferring 100 uL cell suspension to subsequent wells, down to 25% dilution
  6. Centrifuged plates at 300 RCF for 1 minute 
  7. Prepared plate maps (all cells were run on the same plate)  
  
Plate : 10300  




## Imaging

  1. Configure the Zaber session to image the entirety of each well; for 96 well plates this requires a 3 x 3 stitched image
  2. Take images of each well on the blue fluroescence ("DAPI") and green fluorescence ("AF488") channels




## Analysis

  1. Analyzed the blue- and green-channel images using the DAPI MIA macro
  2. Downloaded and extracted the data then pasted it into this spreadsheet - https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ft7I_Hp3SDVx1VA8uASjfLFgj15d-MWkM7oDDHQRWfw/edit#gid=1235762498
  3. Copied the data from the "Final output" sheet of the "MIA output" data workbook to the "Master Cell Counting Sheet" of the "Suspension culture counting spreadsheet": https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1YuTvXJXQQMIMwRZGeqNjdi20WeURg5FpM-1TJ-zrb1c/edit?usp=sharing
