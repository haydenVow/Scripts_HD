Background

An MCB of F_CHOMP07 cells (Saltwater crocodile myofibroblasts) was recently
banked at Vow. See lab book here: https://au-
mynotebook.labarchives.com/share/Vow%2520-%2520Team%2520Science/NDE4Ny4zfDEwNjMxNy8zMjIxLTI0NzI0L1RyZWVOb2RlLzc4ODA3OTIzNXwxMDYyOS4z  
The F_CHOMP09 cell line was derived from cells isolated following a trypsin
isolation protocol which was developed inhouse.

Here, we will expand cells from the MCB to a WCB of >400M cells for future use
by both the Science and Production teams.  
  
A WCB of CHOMP09 cells is also being expanded. See lab book for the CHOMP09
expansion here: https://au-
