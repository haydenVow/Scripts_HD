Process:

  1. Prepared 1 mL of 212.5 uL/mL of sterile Hoechst in PBS solution using 'new' Hoechst (stock ID: 3722 )
  2. Added 20uL/well of staining solutions to wells as follows:
    1. The bolded wells in column 1 and 2. These are wells that have either remained unstained or only stained on the first passage. Staining these will be used as a 'sacrifice' to see the cell counts for these conditions. These wells will not be used for further passaging.
    2.   3. Incubated plate at room temp in BSC in the dark 11:33 - 11:53
  4. Imaged all stained wells, as well as unstained wells  
    1. 5x, main lab Zaber (all)
    2. Phase: exposure 4, illuminator lamp: ~1
    3. DAPI whole well: exposure 100, illuminator lamp: 35
    4. DAPI center of well: same settings as above
  5. Returned plate to incubator 
    1. 37 degrees, 5% CO2, ID #52




Observations/Summary:

Stained wells with ~17uL/mL of Hoechst and imaged them.

 ~~Results will be determined after image analysis.~~

Obtaining cell counts from images of clumped cells will not be accurate.
Therefore, this plate was discarded and the experiment was terminated.
