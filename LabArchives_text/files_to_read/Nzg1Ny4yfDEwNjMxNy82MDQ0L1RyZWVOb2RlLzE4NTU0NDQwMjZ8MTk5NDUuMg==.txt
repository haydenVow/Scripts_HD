Process:

1\. Imaged each plate on 10x and 20x magnification.

2\. Aliquotted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then
placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath for a minimum of 20 minutes
prior to use:

  1. 0.25%Trypsin-EDTA:     10  mL in    1   
  2. dPBS (for washing and neutralising)   20  mL in     1  tub
  3. Growth media (for seeding):   60  mL in    1    tub
  4. Times that all aliquots were placed in the water bath to warm before use   12:33

Note: if aliquots were placed in water bath at different times, record the
time stamp for each individual solution.




2\. Washed the flask(s) 2x with with dPBS.

3\. Added     5mL (T75), 0.5mL (12 well plate) or 2ml (6 well plate) trypsin
to each vessel/well and incubated at 37ËšC for    10min (WALLE07), 13min
(WALLE06)17min (WALLE09) , checking ever 3-4 min under the microscope.  
  
WALLE07: 13:10  
WALLE06 + WALLE09: 13:55

4\. Neutralised with dPBS (warmed) transferred cell suspension into a   1 x
50mL    tube/ culture.  

5\. Centrifuged at 650 x g for 5 min  
WALLE07: 13:23  
WALLE06 + WALLE09: 14:  

  




6\. Aspirated the supernatant(s)\+ Resuspended pellet(s) in      1 mL
growth  media

8\. Performed a cell count using the haemocytometer and recorded the cell
count data in widget or the Google Doc spreadsheet called 'Cell Count
Spreadsheet' (see link below):

Cell counts

WALLE06: 880,000  
WALLE07: 980,000  
WALLE09: 75,000

11\. Volume of cell suspension required for subculture was: 22mL (WALLE06)
24mL (WALLE07) 3mL (WALLE09)  

12\. Transfer  cell suspension to the pre-warmed Growth Media.

13\. Transfer cell suspension into flasks/plates.

WALLE06: seeded into 1xT75 + 2x T25, 7040/cm  
WALLE07: seeded into 2x T75, 6530/cm  
WALLE09: seeded into 1x wells of a 6 well plate, 7894/cm

14\. Transfer flask/plate(s) to incubate at:

WALLE06: 14:40  
WALLE07: 13:50  
WALLE09: 14:55
