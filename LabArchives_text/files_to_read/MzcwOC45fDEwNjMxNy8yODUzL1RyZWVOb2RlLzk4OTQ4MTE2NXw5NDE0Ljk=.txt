Process:

  1. Aliquotted   9mL  mL of  Growth Media (Previously done)
  2. Added    4.5uL  mL of p38i (Previously done)
  3. Placed in water bath   9:45  
  4. Removed  50 % (70uL) of supernatant from vessel. 
  5. Replaced with  70 uL (per well/per vessel) of  Growth  media. 
  6. Returned vessel to incubate at:   11:35 

  * [X]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (aviary cells)

  

  * Incubator (Thermo), Lab [Main]




### Observations/Summary:

 50 % media changed on vessel(s)

  1. 7438 and 7437

  

Note: Not enough media initially aliquoted. Additional media was warmed to
finish the media change on half of plate 7437. Used separate tips for each
well when replacing the media.
