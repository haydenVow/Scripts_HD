Background and Aims


Background

Nuvonis cells grow optimally to very high cell density (6M/ml) in Hycell Media
supplemented with IGF1 and EGF. Currently we are using a lot of media (~4-8L
per week) and therefore a lot of GFs.

Aim

To trial how well Nuvonis suspension cells grow without IGF and EGF
supplementation.

Experimental plan

We will seed 100k cells per mL into 3xE250 flasks cultured in 50/50
RPMI/Hycell + GF media and 3xE250 flasks cultured in 50/50 RPMI/Hycell only.
Flasks will be cultured for 6 days and cells will be counted every other day
to track cell growth. Media will not be changed during this period.


Methods


  1. Cells were passaged and harvested according to the Cell Supply protocol on 18th July.
  2. Flask #12912 was used to seed 6x E250 flasks with 100,000 cells per mL in 50mL of media for a total of 5 million cells per flask
  3. Flasks were cultured at 37deg at 120rpm shaking speed in incubator #76(?)
  4. Flask IDs and conditions were as follows:
    1. 12931 \- With GF
    2. 12932 \- With GF
    3. 12933 \- With GF
    4. 12934 \- No GF
    5. 12935 \- No GF
    6. 12936 - No GF
