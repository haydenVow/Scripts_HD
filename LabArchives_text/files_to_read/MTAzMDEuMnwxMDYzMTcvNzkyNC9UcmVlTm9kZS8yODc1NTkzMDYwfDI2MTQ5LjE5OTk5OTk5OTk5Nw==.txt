Preparation  
Prepared the following prior to the arrival of the sample.  

  * Surgical drapes
  * Iodine spray/solution
  * 70% ethanol bottle
  * Lab coats
  * Gloves
  * Sterile guaze - 6 packs
  * Sterile forceps - 4/biopsy
  * Sterile scalpels - 4/biopsy
  * Sterile scissors - 4/biopsy
  * Hair clippers - 1 set
  * Esky with ice packs (if biopsy is being transported to Vow)
  * Rediwipes 
  * Permanent markers
  * COLLECTION MEDIA- DMEM/F12 + 10% FBS + 1% x P/S (1x 25mL in 50mL tube - 1 per biopsy+ 1spare)- Tubes labelled with biopsy ID's
  * WASH PBS - PBS + 1% x P/S (1x 25mL in 50mL tube - 1 per biopsy+ 1spare)- Tubes labelled with the same biopsy ID's as the collection media

Observations: Please note and signs of leakage, comment on the status of the
ice/gel packs (melted/cold to touch ect). Upon handling the tissue samples
(still inside their container/bag), note whether the tissue samples are cold
to the touch or not. This serves as a simple gut-check that the samples have
indeed arrived in a chilled state.

Biopsy Process  
  
Preparing the tissue

  1. Selected the desired muscles to be targeted for each biopsy
  2. Removed sample from fridge time stamp
  3. Sprayed the tissue liberally with 70% ethanol and wiped clean with sterile gauze
  4. Pour a small volume (30-50 mL) of povidone iodine solution into a sterile kidney dish and dab a sterile gauze into the dish
  5. Use sterile forceps to dab the sample with the iodine soaked gauze. Once covered, allowed the iodine to sit for 5 minutes 
  6. Repeated the iodine treatment
  7. Dabbed away excess iodine using a fresh, sterile gauze

Taking the biopsies from the tissue

  1. Using sterile forceps and a sterile scalpel, cut a shallow (2-3 mm deep) outline of the area that is to be the source for the biopsy
  2. Carefully cut away the top layer of tissue inside the outline from the previous step
  3. Discarded the top layer of tissue
  4. Cut a cube of tissue from the biopsy site, roughly a minimum size of 10x10x10mm.
  5. Place the first biopsy into a 50 mL tube containing 10 mL dPBS + P/S to wash, then transferred to the collection media tube containing DMEM/F12  \+ 10% FBS 1 x P/S  with the same ID
  6. Photographed the biopsy site  
  7. Repeated all steps above for each new biopsy
