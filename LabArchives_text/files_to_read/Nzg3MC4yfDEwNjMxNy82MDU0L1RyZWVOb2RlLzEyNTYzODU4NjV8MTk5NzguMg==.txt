10037-WALLE06-Wallaby P4-3of3  
Cells do not have a typical fibroblast morphology. They have enlarged
cytoplasm and for triangular shapes without the elongated projections seen in
fibroblasts/

10034-WALLE07-Bennets Wallaby P4-2of2  
Cells appear senescent. They have enlarged cytoplasm and nuclei. They are also
granulated and have scrappy borders.

Again, cells are not showing a morphology typical of fibroblasts however their
nuclei and cytoplasm are not as enlarged as in the other cultures.

Process

  1. Placed  40mL of growth media in the water bath at 37C 13:40  
  

  2. Culture vessels removed from the incubator 08:40 (imaging), 14:25 (feed)   
  

  3. Each vessel was examined under the microscope and imaged at 10x and 20x magnifications. Observations were recorded in the table bellow  
  

  4. Removed 50% of the media from each well.    
  
  

  5. Replaced with pre-warmed growth media.  
  

  6. Culture vessels returned to library lab incubator 77, 37C and 5% CO2 08:59 (imaging), 14:36 (feed)
