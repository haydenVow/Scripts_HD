ALL single cell sorted 96 well plates for FASLG and AQP1 clones containing
HycellCho + KSR + IGF1-LR3 and FGF-b were discarded. These plates contained
wells contaminated with a fungus. The adherent plate containing single cell
sorted FASLG knockout cells was accidentally discarded during this process.
