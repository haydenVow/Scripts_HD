Aim/Purpose


To determine whether cells can be trained to grow in suspension through serial
passages without tryplisation


Hypothesis


That a small proportion of the cells that do not adhere to culture vessels
will be viable and easily adapt to suspension culture conditions


Technical Gap


We do not yet know the best way to adapt cells to suspension culture. Some
cells which do not adhere to plasticware may have a natural inclination to
grow in suspension.


Method/Procedure


  1. [Experiment Plan]
    * Transfer medium from KUZCO fibroblasts to 15 mL tube during passage. Centrifuge, re-suspend in fresh medium, and plate in 24-WP.
    * On Day 4, move cells to 15 mL tube, centrifuge, 50% feed, and move to new well. Repeat every 3-4 days.
    * Stain cells with CMFDA and image to determine cell viability 
    * If cells are still sticking to surface after 2 weeks, add pluronic (?) to medium to reduce adherence 
    * After 30 days, attempt to move cells to E125 flask and place on shaker
    * 100% feed & count every 48 hours
  2. Experiment Plan 2.0
    1. Transfer supernatant from NANDO T175 to T25 (D0)
    2. 100% feed (D1)
    3. 100% feed every Tuesday and Friday and take haemocytometer sample to count cells and check viability. If cell count becomes difficult with haemocytometer, use live/dead staining and image with zaber 
    4. If cells are sticking to surface of flask, add pluronic to medium (check with Tom which type and what concentration)
    5. On D? transfer cells to 50 mL shake tube and place on orbital shaker at
