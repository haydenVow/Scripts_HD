### Process:

1\. Took images of each vessel with microscope on phase setting (10X)

2\. Aliquoted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then
placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath for a minimum of 20 minutes
prior to use:

  1. TrypLE:   5  mL in   1 x 15 mL  tube
  2.  dPBS (for neutralising & washing):   10  mL
  3. Growth media (for pellet resuspension):  3 mL   

  4. Growth media (for seeding):    12  mL

Time that all aliquots were placed in the water bath the warm before use
13:00  

Note: if aliquots were placed in water bath at different time, record the time
stamp for each individual solution.




3\. Removed vessel(s) from the incubator   13:43  

4\. Washed the vessel(s) with  5 mL per flask dPBS (warmed).

5\. Added   5  mL tryple to each vessel/well and incubated at 37˚C.

  1. Start/Finish for TrypLE was     13:46 -13:56    

6\. Neutralised with   5 mL    dPBS and moved the cell suspension into   1 x
50 mL  tubes (We are using 50mL tubes instead of 15mL tube as it is too
narrow.  

7\. Centrifuged at 650 x g for 5 min.

  1. Start time for centrifugation was    13:59    




8\. Aspirated the supernatant.

9\. Resuspended pellet in   2  mL   growth  medium (resuspend in more media if
needed)  

10\. Aliquoted   10 uL  of resuspended cells into a microcentrifuge tube for
cell count.

11\. Performed a cell count using the haemocytometer and recorded the cell
count data in the Google Doc spreadsheet: Cell Count Spreadsheet or cell count
widget below

  1. Total cell number was:    

    * CHOMP09:    3,080,000  cells    

  2. Volume of cell suspension required for subculture was:    

    1. CHOMP09:   365 uL  
  3. Cell density per vessel:   7500 cells/cm2   
  4. Add cell counts to the doublings calculator to allow tracking over time: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1kiVXcsre8aDPtA9DjQ84WzN0dLb7jrzD9GehzExe7Ng/edit#gid=0  




12\. Transferred the cell suspension of the following volume into the pre-
warmed   12 mL growth medium:  

  * CHOMP09:  365uL  

13\. Transferred cell suspension into   1x T75  vessels.

14\. Transferred vessel(s) to incubate at:   14:20  

  * [ ]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (avian cells)
  * [x]  30ºC, 5% CO2 (reptilian cells)




Observations/Summary:

Culture over confluent- 100% and begnning to peel. See image link bellow.
