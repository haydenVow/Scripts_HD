It was noted that in the flask 12504 when a manual count was conducted, a
pipette tip fell in the flask due to the P1000 pipette tips not fitting the
pipette correctly.

  

## Flask 12537 - Used in Mini-Tissue Stream

All of the cells in this flask were given to the Mini Tissues stream.

## 2) To achieve the cell total of 900M for the Mini-Tissue stream,
184,326,000 cells were needed to be extracted from Flask 12504.

## 3) 57.41mL was aliquoted for the Mini-Tissue stream to achieve 184,326,000.
The remaining 76.94mL were spun down in a 50mL falcon tube, supernatant
removed and placed in the freezer for Kylie to use.

## Steps for Passage of Flask 12536 into Flask 12588 & Flask 12589

1\. The initial volume, density and total cells of 12536 was noted as
198.25mL, 3.21M cells/mL, 648.2 M cells, respectively.

2\. 205.36mL of 50/50 Hycell/RPMI media was aliquoted to a 500mL container

3\. 0.205mL of IGF and 0.041mL of EGF were added to the 205.36mL of media.

4\. 33.32mL was deposited into 2 x E500 flasks each and 102.68mL was deposited
into the 2 x E500 flasks each.

5\. Total volume of each E500 flask is 136mL

6\. A second cell count was performed using the Vicell before returning to the

  1. Placed flask in the incubator  18:00 a/pm (37 C, 5% CO2, 120 RPM)  

Seed flask details:

  * Seeding density: x10^6 cells / mL
  * Growth Medium Volume in the seed flask:  136mL
  * Flask size: E500  (flat bottom / baffled)
  * Refer to summary table above

7\. The remaining 131.61mL  of cells in the original E500 flask (12536) were
spun down weighed and frozen.




Cells taken by Shaleen (21/06):

  1. A cell count was performed on Culture 12588 by taking 550uL of culture media.
  2. The ViCell XR threw a camera error and the computer and machine were restarted. The sample was been consumed by the machine.
  3. Another 550uL aliquot was taken for a successful cell count.

Cell count: 2.2M cells/mL

  1. Additionally 1mL of culture media was taken by Shaleen for his experiment.




## Summary/ Results

__ cells were expanded from 1 x E_ flask into 1 x E_ flask.
