n=5 - MuSC only (without L-ascorbic acid)

n=5 - MuSC only (with 50ug/mL L-ascorbic acid)

n=4 - Empty Zein

Process:

Mitomycin-c treatment (Prepare Mitomycin stock solution)

For all of the samples on Zein scaffolds add 0.5mg/ml of mitomycin-c for 4
hours (Diekmann et al., 2015).

  

In order to prepare mitomycin-c solution in growth media (0.5 mg/mL) need to
first prepare a stock solution.

1\. Weigh out 1 mg of Mitomycin C   S# 1800  and allow it to equilibrate at
room temperature for 10 min in an enclosed 15 mL falcon tube.

2\. Transfer the tube into the BSC and add 2.5 mL of sterile dPBS   M# 4309 to
dissolve mitomycin C at 40 mg/mL ->  M# 4445

3\. Sterile filtered the solution through a 0.22 um filter to sterilise the
solution.

4\. Add 0.5 mL of the mitomycin stock solution into 39.5 mL of pre-aliquoted
growth media  M# 4380  (DMEM/F12 + 20% FBS + 1X P/S) ->  M# 4446

Store the remaining mitomycin stock solution at 4'C, wrapped in aluminium foil
for no longer than two weeks.

5\. Aliquot the 40 mL mitomycin and growth media mix into two separate tubes
containing 12 mL and 16 mL of solution respectively.

6\. Add 50ug/mL L-ascorbic acid to the falcon tube containing 12 mL of media
and label it as   Growth Media + Vitamin C + Mitomycin C

7\. Leave the other tube (16 mL) with only growth media and mitomycin C and
label it as   Growth Media + Mitomycin C only

8\. Pipette 1 mL of solution per well over the relevant samples.

  1.   Growth Media + Vitamin C + Mitomycin C  Wells B1-B5 and D1-D5  

  2.   Growth Media + Mitomycin C only Wells A1-A6, B6, C1-C6 and D6   

9\. Allow samples to incubate with mitomycin C for at least 4 hours

  1.  Start/Finish time for incubation 11:34 - 15:34 

10\. Wash all 24-well plates scaffold samples 3x 5 minute washes with 2 mL
sterile dPBS   M# 4309

  1. 15:40 - 15:45
  2. 15:48 -  15: 53
  3.  15: 55 - 16:00

11\. Wash all 24-well plate scaffold samples with 1mL/well/wash with growth
media (DMEM/F12 + 20% FBS + 1X P/S +- 50ug/mL L-ascorbic acid) for 5 minutes
16:10 - 16:15

12\. Transfer all 24-well plate scaffolds into fresh media (2mL/well) for at
least 1 hours before removing media and seeding with MuSCs. 16:30 - 17:30

Harvest and seeding of MuSCs (performed by BT and JB) - see 3/05 (Mon) - 4CF
Passage + seed in Cycle 2 cell expansion folder

  1. Harvest cells as per passaging SOP.
  2. Resuspend pellet in `DMEM/F12 + 20% FBS+ 1X PS` media.
  3. Perform a cell count using a hemocytometer (1:1 dilution in Trypan blue):

  

Scaffold seeding (with cells) = 20M cells needed- 1M per piece

  1. Divide the cell count by number of samples (20) to work out how many cells we can achieve per piece.
  2. Re-suspend the cells in 70µL x 10 of DMEM/F12 + 20% FBS + 1x PS ( no vit C)
  3. Re-suspend the cells in 70µL x 10 of DMEM/F12 + 20% FBS + 1x PS ( + 50ug/mL L-ascorbic-acid )
  4. Aspirate Growth Media off scaffolds.
  5. Seed all cell-laden samples with 70ul of cell suspension per piece:
  6. Add 70uL of DMEM/F12 + 20% FBS + 1x PS ( no vit C) to each of the cell-free samples. (ZEIN ONLY - NO CELLS)

7\. After 30minutes (to allow the cells to adhere) add 2mL of pre-warmed
DMEM/F12 + 20% FBS + 1x PS (with and without 50ug/mL L-ascorbic acid
respectively) into each well.

8\. Place the plate in the incubator (37'C, 5% CO2).
