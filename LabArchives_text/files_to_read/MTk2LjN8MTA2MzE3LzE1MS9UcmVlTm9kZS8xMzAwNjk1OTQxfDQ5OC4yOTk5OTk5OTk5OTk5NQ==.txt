### Process:

Prepare materials

1\. Took image of vessel with microscope on phase setting.

2\. Estimated how many 96 well plates, T175 flasks and E125 flasks would be
required (seed E125 flasks with 10x the number of cells as a T175 flask)

\- 2 x 96 well plates, 6 wells per plate

\- 1 x 4CF

\- 3 x E125 flasks

3\. Prepare and equilibrate E125 flask(s) - 4.5 mg/mL Cytodex 1 in 30 mL
working volume:

  1. Shook the stock Cytodex 1 suspension well to resuspend
  2. Quickly aspirated 6.8 mL of the stock suspension and transferred to a fresh E125 flask
  3. Added 15 mL of fresh culture medium to the E125 flask
  4. Waited 1 minute for the microcarriers to settle
  5. Gently tilted the flask and aspirated 12 mL of supernatant
  6. Added 27 mL of culture medium to the flask
  7. Transferred the flask to the incubator to equilibrate for at least 1 hour before use.     13:40    

4\. Gelatin coat 1 x 4CF

5\. Gelatin coat diff plates - make sure to leave columns for PBS at the edge
and rows for 2% HS, rows for E6.     12:55  

3\. Aliquotted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then
placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath for a minimum of 20 minutes
prior to use:

  1. TrypLE:     80    mL in    1 x 100mL urine pot     tubes
  2.  dPBS (for washing and neutralising):     80    mL in    1 x 100mL urine     tubes
  3. Growth media (for pellet resuspension):     6    mL in     1 x 15 mL    tubes
  4. Growth media (for seeding 4CF):     650    mL in     1L Storage Bottle    tubes   

  5. P38i (325uL) for 650mL of Growth Media
  6. Time that all aliquots were placed in the water bath the warm before use     14:30  

Note: if aliquots were placed in water bath at different time, record the time
stamp for each individual solution.

  

Perform passage

3\. Removed 8 x T175 from the incubator     14:50  

4\. Washed the vessel(s) with dPBS (warmed).

5\. Added     10    mL tryple to each T175 and incubated at 37˚C.

  1. Start/Finish for TrypLE was     15:01 -  15:25  

6\. Neutralised with     10mL     dPBS (warmed) and combined cell suspension
into a     4 x 50mL    tube.

7\. Centrifuged at 650 x g for 5 min.

  1. Start/Finish time for centrifugation was     15:37 - 15:42   

8\. Aspirated the supernatant(s).

9\. Resuspended pellet(s) in     1.5    mL     Growth     media     :   and
combined all into 1x tube  

10\. Aliquoted     10 uL     of resuspended cells into a microcentrifuge tube
for cell count.

11\. Performed a cell count using the haemocytometer and recorded the cell
count data in the Google Doc spreadsheet called 'Cell Count Spreadsheet' (see
link below):

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1DPzKubYxfHmWogVPihC-
SSIBtIylyrBQE5kRX5Z8NtI/edit#gid=0

  1.  Total cell number was:     12,744,000        

  2. Volume of cell suspension required for subculture in diff plates:      47 uL into 2 mL       

  3. Volume of cell suspension required for subculture in 4CF:    1.883 mL into 600 mL         

  4. Volume of cell suspension required for subculture in E125 flasks:     Remainder, split 3 ways        

  

Seeding diff plates, E125 and 4CF:

12\. Transferred       47    µl of cell suspension to the pre-warmed      2
mL Growth media:      16:20  

13\. Transferred cell suspension into the pre-gelatin coated      2 x 96 wp
vessel.

15\. Transferred vessel(s) to incubate at:

  * [x]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (avian cells)

16\. Transferred       1900    µl of cell suspension to the pre-warmed
650     mL Growth media:  

17\. Transferred cell suspension into the pre-gelatin coated      2 x 96 wp
vessel.

18\. Left at RT in the BSC for 30 min to allow cells to settle    4CF: 16:40 -
17:10  

19\. Transferred vessel(s) to incubate at:

  * [ ]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (avian cells)

### Seeding microcarriers

Intermittent agitation to facilitate adhesion

  1. Transferred cell suspension (from Culture XXXX) containing `X million cells` in   mL to the equilibrated microcarrier suspension in the culture vessel.

  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (aviary cells)

  

  1. Began the seeding schedule for 6 hours (below) using the KASA app.
    1. The minimum required agitation speed for shaken cultures to maintain the microcarriers in suspension can be estimated using this calculator: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/18NrC_xaJ2I87B4x3vTE46Z-ZUS3EV0Gw-CnM0DcukL4/edit?usp=sharing
      * Shake speed used =
    2. The seeding schedule may be reduced or extended by removing or adding 30 minute cycles as required. Generally, at least 3 but up to 12 hours are required to allow the maximum number of the inoculated cells to adhere.
