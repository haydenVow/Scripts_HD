Prepare materials for thaw and seed:

1\. Gelatin coated  2  x  96 well  plates with sterile filtered 0.1% gelatin
solution and then incubated all coated flasks at 37ºC

  * Time when all flasks placed into the incubator   10:53 a/pm 

2\. Aliquotted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then
placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath for a minimum of 20 minutes
prior to use:

  *  Growth media (for seeding):   16 mL 
  * Time that aliquot was placed in the water bath to warm before use:   : a/pm 

  




## Thaw and seed vial:

`6. Collected the entire  mL of cell suspension & transfer into the pre-warmed
tube of Growth Media. `

`7. Using a 10mL serological pipette, resuspended & distributed the cells
evenly in the   mL of pre-warmed Growth Media (prepared in Step 2). `

`8. Transfered   mL to each pre-coated   96 well, allow to rest in the BSC at
RT for 30 min  : - : a/pm `

9\. Seed the two plates in the following manner:  
  
Figure 1. Plate map for DSD pre-screening seeding. Plate 2 will be the control
plate  
  
  
`10. Transfered flask/plate(s) to incubate at: `

  * [ ]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (aviary cells)

  

Making labels

Note - You will need to increase the passage number by one. (i.e. if your
thawed vial ID has a passage number of 3, when you make a culture ID for you
vessel you will need change the passage number to 4 on Airtable.)
