For all feeds:

1\. Aliquoted 350 mL growth media across1x 500 mL pot.

2\. Added stock P38 inhibitor to each tube (1:2000 dilution)  | 175 ul  |

3\. Placed growth media aliquots in water bath at  | 13:39 |

### Feed (2 x Diff Plates) - Completed 15/04 07:46:

  1. Inspect both plates under the Primo, 10x objective, phase and capture and image of all 6 wells.
  2. Proceed with feed below on one set of the 2 plates.
  3. Aliquot and warm up 1 mL of DMEM/F12 + 20% FBS + 1X P/S + P38i for 15 minutes  07:46 - 08:01
  4. Transfer the media to a reservoir in the BSC before feeding for easy handling using the multichannel pipette.
  5. One plate was incubated while other was fed.
  6. Removed  `100` % of supernatant from plate(s). (aspirate only until there is slightly enough liquid to cover the base of the well instead of the whole 100uL to avoid leaving the cells to dry).
  7. Replaced with  `0.1` mL (per well/per flask) of  `DMEM/F12 + 20% FBS + 1X P/S + P38i`  media to  of each plate. Use fresh tips only in the new media.
  8. Returned flask to incubate at 08:05:
    * [x]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
    * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (aviary cells)
  9. Repeat the feeding process for Plate 2.

  

Feed (4CF):

  1. Removed    50% of supernatant from vessel.
  2. Replaced with   300`mL (per vessel) of` media.
  3. Returned vessel to incubate at:
    * [x]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
    * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (aviary cells)

  

### Feed 3 x  E125s:

4\. Left the microcarrier flasks flat inside the BSC for 2 minutes to allow
the microcarriers to settle to the base of the flask.

5\. Used a 10mL pipette to carefully remove   15 mL  of the supernatant from
flask 1-4. Aspirating slowly and following the edge of the meniscus so as to
avoid aspirating microcarriers at the base of the flask.

6\. Replaced with  ` 15 mL ` (per well/per vessel) of   `warmed growth`
media.

7\. Repeated steps 5 and 6 for remaining flasks.

8\. Returned vessel to incubate shaking at 120 RPM

  * [ ]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (aviary cells)
  * Bottom binder incubator, top shaker.

Analyzed images:

  1. MICROCARRIERS: All images from each culture captured today were used to determine the distribution of cells/microcarrier using the FIJI-based microcarrier image analysis macro `uCarrier cell count plastic` using MIA capture.

  

### Process (Sampling):

Took sample

  1. Transferred 0.02 mL of the well suspended microcarrier culture to a well in a 96-well plate. mixed with 0.08 mL of dPBS.
  2. Carriers were mixed by swirling on a flat surface of the BSC, sample was taken while the liquid was still in motion.
  3. Inspected the microcarriers using the Axio microscope to observe monolayer (there should not be any overlapping microcarriers as this will hamper analysis.

Stained and imaged cells adhered to microcarriers

  1. Added the Hoechst 33342 ready flow reagent (nuc blue) at a concentration of 20 uL/mL of culture in the well plate (2 uL per well in a 96 well plate).
  2. Left the plate to incubate at room temperature, covered in foil, for 15 minutes. 13:38 - 14:00
  3. Took 3 sets of 2 images (using the phase contrast and blue fluorescence channels) of each well. 14:10

Analyzed images

  1. MICROCARRIERS: The best set of images from each culture was used to determine the distribution of cells/microcarrier using the FIJI-based microcarrier image analysis macro.
