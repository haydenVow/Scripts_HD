AIM/PURPOSE: Determine if Nuvonis quail fibroblast suspension cells can
survive and proliferate alternative basal mediums

HYPOTHESIS: At least one of the following alternative suspension basal
mediums; DMEM/F12, RPMI and Hycell CHO will enable the cells to survive and
proliferate in suspension culture conditions

RESULTS SUMMARY:

  

Figure 1: Proliferation of Nuvonis quail fibroblast cells in different basal
growth mediums.

CONCLUSIONS:

Of the 3 alternative basal mediums tested, only the Hycell CHO media was able
to support growth and proliferation of the Nuvonis cells. Both the RPMI and
DMEM/F12 appear unsuitable for Nuvonis cell growth without further
optimisation. Additionally, compared to Freestyle 293 expression medium, cells
grown in the Hycell CHO were able to surpass the Freestyle condition in terms
of total cell numbers and cell per mL, reaching a peak density >10M cells/mL.

NEXT STEPS:

  * Repeat with sufficient technical replicates (n â‰¥ 3) for statistical analysis to determine the performance of different basal media types relative to the control conditions.
  * Continue optimising the basal media to wean cells off from Hycell CHO, by sequential adaptation (i.e., 50:50 RPMI:Hycell mix) or eliminating the media completely.
