Cell count viable (cells / mL)=

Total cell count in the suspension culture 375,840,000  
  
  

Note: Copy the value for 'viable cells per mL' from Vicell  anc record in the
master cell count spreadsheet, with the respective culture ID and the volume
of growth medium the cells are being cultured in.

  1.  250mL aliquot was taken into 1 x 500mL sterile pot. 
  2. Growth factors were added to the growth media aliquot.
    1.  250uL of IGF-LR3 (mesokine) added
    2.  50uL of rEGF (mesokine) added  
Note: Calculate the amount of growth factor needed for the volume of aliquoted
growth medium by using the E8 Calculator.

  3. Aliquot placed in water bath 15 : 20 pm
  4. 21.5 mL of suspension Cells seeded into 250mL of prewarmed growth media. 136mL aliquotted into 2 x E500 flask (One flask has 132mL).

  6. Placed flask in the incubator  4:40 a/pm (37 C, 5% CO2, 120 RPM)  

Seed flask details:

  * Seeding density: 0.2 x10^6 cells / mL
  * Growth Medium Volume in the seed flask:  mL
  * Flask size: E  (flat bottom / baffled)
