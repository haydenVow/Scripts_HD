Process:

1\. Placed 2 x 2mL weekend aliquots of E6 and DMEM/F12 + 2% HS + 1X P/S
(located in Fridge 105, top shelf) in water bath at  18:53  

2\. Removed 96 well plates from top binder incubator (#67, top shelf). Removed
100 % of media from each well on the 96 well plates.  

3\. Replaced with  100uL (per well) of  Diff   media.

  * Top row (E6 media) 
  * Bottom row (2% HS media). 

4\. Returned plates to incubate at: [20:05] [MG]

  * [x]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (aviary cells)
  * incubator #67.
