Perform feed using below volumes:




Growth Media (Located in Library Lab Fridge 105 (Bottom)):

  * [x]  DMEM/F12 + 20% FBS + 1X P/S + P38i (10uM)

Total media required: 90mL

Total p38i required: 45uL

  




Process:

1\. Aliquotted   30 + 60 mL  mL of  Growth Media into  1 x 120mL Sample
Container     tube(s). Placed in water bath  08:50

2\. Stopped the shaker and removed cultures from the incubator before
restarting the shaker NOTE: SHAKER WAS NOT ON WHEN I ARRIVED   09:15  

3\. Placed suspension flask(s) inside the BSC and allowed to sit static for
3-5 minutes to allow microcarriers to settle to the base of the flask.

2\. Culture 6718:

  1. Carefully removed  50  % of supernatant from the flask (60mL) by pipetting slowly and following the meniscus with the pipette tip so as to avoid placing the pipette tip near the microcarriers at the base of the flask(s). 
  2. Replaced with  60 mL (per well/per vessel) of  growth   media.

3\. Culture 6719:

  1. Carefully removed  50  % of supernatant from the flask (30mL) by pipetting slowly and following the meniscus with the pipette tip so as to avoid placing the pipette tip near the microcarriers at the base of the flask(s). 
  2. Replaced with  30 mL (per well/per vessel) of  growth   media.

4\. Returned vessel to incubate at:  09:30 , incubator #   68

  * [x]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells), incubator #68. 
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (aviary cells)

### Results

  * Results were;
    * [ ]  As Usual (this is a repetitive task)
    * [ ]  Unexpected because...
    * [ ]  Need to be further analysed
    * [ x]  Other (shaker was off when I arrived in the lab)
