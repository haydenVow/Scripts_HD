Note  
All cultures except the BOBO in Nuvonis and the BOBO in Avian media were
discarded today. The BOBO in Nuvonis and Avian medias have had relatively
stable counts for the past week, sitting on approximately 2M cells and 0.5M
cells respectively. This indicates that they are surviving but not
proliferating in culture. In an attempt to kick-start their growth, FGF2 was
added to both cultures today, at a concentration of 0.1ug/mL.




Process:  

  1. Place media in water bath >15min prior to use
  2. Collected E125s from shaker, wiped with ethanol-sprayed Rediwipe, and brought into BSC 
  3. Using a 25 mL serological pipette, gently pipette-mixed culture for 1 minute to break up cell clumps
  4. Transfer suspension into 50 mL tubes.
  5. Centrifuged 50 mL tubes at 300 x g for 5 mins 
  6. Aspirated  75% (15 mL) of supernatant, taking extra care to not disrupt or aspirate pellet.
  7. Resuspended each pellet in the remaining 5mL of media, and took 2x 10ul samples from each culture for hemocytometer counts 
  8. Performed  hemocytometer counts (see below for counts).
  9. Topped up each 50 mL centrifuge tube with 15 mL of fresh pre-warmed media and resuspended cell pellet. 
  10. Pipette-mixed cultures, and transfer all cultures to E250 flask
  11. Returned E250 to incubator

Observations/Summary:  
The BOBBO culture in Nuvonis media was quite clumpy and therefore counts
varied greatly between squares of the hemocytometer within the same sample.
This count is therefore unlikely to be very accurate.
