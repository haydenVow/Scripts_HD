Process:

  1. Aliquoted:
    1.  25 mL  of  DMEM + 10% FBS + 1xP/S  
      * Added 250 uL of "Anti-Clumping Agent" to aliquot 
    2. 10 mL of D/F + 10% FBS + 1xP/S 
    3. 10 mL of D/F + 5% FBS + 1:100 ACA + 1xP/S  
Placed in water bath:   11:35  

  2. Collected E125 culture vessels from shakers, wiped with ethanol-sprayed cloth and brought into BSC (if necessary, paused shakers by pressing the "play" button on the controller on the side wall of the incubator)
  3. Using a 5 mL serelogical pipette, gently pipette-mixed cultures for ~1 minute to break up cell clumps
  4. Pipetted suspensions though 70 um cell strainer into 3 x 50 mL tubes (keep E125 flask and spin tubes in BSC as cultures will be returned to these post centrifugation) 
  5. Centrifuged at 300 x g for 5 min. Timestamp: 11:56 - 12:01     

  6. Aspirated supernatants, taking care to not disrupt or aspirate pellets
  7. Re-suspended cultures in 500 uL of growth media.
  8. Took 1 x 20 uL aliquot and performed cell count, recording counts in this spreadsheet https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1YuTvXJXQQMIMwRZGeqNjdi20WeURg5FpM-1TJ-zrb1c/edit#gid=1104649984
    1. Count: 26,000
  9. Replaced fresh, warmed media
  10. Gently pipette-mixed cultures again before moving back to E125 flask 
  11. Returned vessels to incubator and replaced in clamp. If shaker was paused, remembered to press play to restart shaking. Timestamp:  12:17     

  12. Incubator (#68), Lab [Main/Library/Production]  
  

  13. Collected spin tube culture vessels from shakers, wiped with ethanol-sprayed cloth and brought into BSC (if necessary, paused shakers by pressing the "play" button on the controller on the side wall of the incubator) 12:36
  14. Using a 5 mL serelogical pipette, gently pipette-mixed cultures for ~1 minute to break up cell clumps
  15. Pipetted suspensions though 70 um cell strainer into 3 x 50 mL tubes (keep E125 flask and spin tubes in BSC as cultures will be returned to these post centrifugation) 
  16. Centrifuged at 300 x g for 5 min. Timestamp: 12:40 - 12:45     

  17. Aspirated supernatants, taking care to not disrupt or aspirate pellet
  18. Re-suspended cultures in 500 uL of growth media.
  19. Took 1 x 20 uL aliquots and performed cell count, recording counts in this spreadsheet https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1YuTvXJXQQMIMwRZGeqNjdi20WeURg5FpM-1TJ-zrb1c/edit#gid=1104649984
    1. Count 7415: 28800 
    2. Count 7417: 0 
      1. Suspected that pellet was aspirated accidentally at some point this week. Repeated count with fresh 20 uL aliquot and also got a count of 0 cells. Discarded culture. 
  20. Replaced fresh, warmed media
  21. Gently pipette-mixed cultures again before moving back to E125 flask and 1 x spin tube
  22. Returned vessels to incubator. If shaker was paused, remembered to press play to restart shaking. Spin tubes should be shaking at 206 RPM Timestamp:  13:14     




### Observations/Summary:

 100 % media changed on vessel(s)

  1. 7342-NANDO3F-Chicken P3-1of1
  2. 7415-NANDO3F-Chicken P5-1of1
  3. 7417-NANDO3F-Chicken P5-1of1 - zero cells counted, suspect that pellet was aspirated today or during a feed this week
