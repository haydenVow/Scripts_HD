50% Feed on 2x4XCF + 1x10CF


TERMINATED DUE TO CONTAMINATION

Due to the widespread fungal contamination across the labs and the high
possibility that this infection originated for the WCB bank used to see this
batch, it was decided to terminated this culture despite not observing any
spindle structures in the flasks. This fungal infection was found to be very
slow growing and so it was likely that the infection was in these flasks but
not yet detectable. Due to their small size from being at the very beginning
of the process this was not considered a great loss to be on the side of
caution.




# Procedure - Feed

# Note: Fibroblasts do NOT require Gelatin coated Flasks, and do NOT require
p38i.  

  1. Turn on the water bath and set to 32'C.
  2. Aliquot  required growth media into a sterile container/s and place into the water bath. 
  3. Place in the water bath and heat for at least 20 minutes.
  4. Observe the cell flasks for confluence under the microscope using 4 x magnification and take images as required. Note: The confluence of cells must be <50% to perform cell feeding in P1-P3 and <80% in P4 prior to the cell differentiation stage. 
  5. Transfer flasks to the BSC and remove required volume of media from each flask (according to the Table below).
  6. Replace the same volume into each flask with the prepared growth media.
  7. Return the flasks to the incubators
