Prepare materials for thaw and seed:

  1. Made media for re-suspending the cells: 
    * 5 mL re-suspension medium (DMEM/F12+10%FBS)   

    * Growth medium for seeding (DMEM/F12 + 10% FBS + 1x PS + 1:100 ACA)
      * 10 mL, 0.5 mL, 0.5 mL & 0.5 mL aliquots in 4 x 15 mL tubes for droplet seeding and serial dilution 
    * Time that aliquots were placed in the water bath to warm before use: 16:05  

  2. Prepare agarose-coated T25 flask 
    1. Set water bath to 90'C 
    2. Place glass bottle containing autoclaved 1% Agarose solution in 90'C waterbath for 30 minutes or until it becomes a pourable liquid 13:22 - 14:15 (hit 90'C at ~13:45 )
    3. Submerge flask into waterbath (keep lid above water) for 1 min to warm up once Agarose solution is ready
    4. Quickly bring both glass bottle and flask into BSC
    5. Pour liquid Agarose solution into T25 and swirl in flask to fully coat internal surface
    6. Discard any excess solution from flask
    7. Allow to set at RT for minimum 2 hours 14:20 - 18:00

  




## Thaw and seed droplets:

  1. Collected the cryovial from Liquid Nitrogen storage & place in foam floater in water bath for 3 min    17:16 - 17:19   

    * Location where cryovial was collected from:  
Vial details: 1 x DOLLY12_F cryovial at 1M cells each for a total of 1M cells  
Brew  
Tower/Bucket # 2  
Box/Cane # 2  
Vial location: F2  
Vial ID(s): 2308-Culture-6303-Vial-29of115

  2. Ethanol sprayed & transferred the vial(s) to the BSC. 
  3. Added 0.5 mL of Growth Media (to generate a total volume of 1mL in the cryovial) to the cryovial, then transfer to 15 mL tube containing 5 mL warmed medium
  4. Centrifuged 15 mL tube for 5 minutes at 600 x g. 17:21 - 17:26
  5. Aspirated 100% of supernatant and resuspended in 10 mL Growth Medium (for seeding)
  6. Using a 10 mL serological pipette, resuspended & distributed the cells evenly 
  7. Perform serial dilution:
    1. Collected 3 x 0.5 mL aliquots of warmed growth medium 
    2. Took 1 x 500 uL aliquot from the 10 mL cell suspension (100,000 cells / mL) and added to 1 x 500 uL aliquot (1 mL, 50,000 cells / mL)
    3. Took 1 x 500 uL aliquot from the 1 mL (50,000 cells / mL) cell suspension and added to next 500 uL aliquot (1 mL, 25,000 cells / mL)
    4. Took 1 x 500 uL aliquot from the 1 mL (25,000 cells / mL) cell suspension and added to the final 0.5 mL aliquot (1 mL, 12,500 cells / mL) 
  8. Hung 20 (+/-2) x 10 uL droplets per lid of 4 x 60 mm plates with each plate seeded with a different cell seeding density (e.g. plate 1 droplets contained 100,000 cells / mL, plate 2 droplets contained 50,000 cells / mL, plate 3 droplets contained 25,000 cells / mL, and plate 4 droplets contained 12,500 cells / mL)
  9. Hung 20 (+/-2) x 10 uL droplets on a fifth plate with ~5 droplets of each seeding density
  10. Retrieved Agarose-coated and uncoated T25 flask and brought into BSC
  11. Using a 10 mL serelogical, resuspended and evenly distributed cells within the growth medium then transferred 4.5 mL to a new 15 mL tube (2 x 4.5 mL aliquots of cell suspension) 
  12. Added 1 g/L poloxamer 407 to one aliquot and labelled
  13. Seeded 2 x T25s:
    1. Aliquot without poloxamer seeded into agarose-coated flask 
    2. Aliquot with poloxamer seeded into uncoated flask 
  14. Moved flasks to incubate at 37'C & 5% CO2 18:08
