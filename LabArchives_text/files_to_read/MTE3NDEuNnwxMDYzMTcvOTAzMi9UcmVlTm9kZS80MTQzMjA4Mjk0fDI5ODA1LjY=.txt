Aim:


To demonstrate a collagenous cell sheet prototype by implementing an optimised
concentration of Ficoll PM 70 on Nuvonis fibroblasts cultured in a cell
factory.


Background


The MMC DSD #3 experiment lead to the insight that 120 mg/ml of Ficoll PM 70
produced the thickest cell monolayer in in vitro culture (when compared to the
other concentrations tested). However, due to the fragility of the cell
monolayers in DSD #3, the pipetting force caused during the fixing and
collagen analysis process, resulted in cell loss to variable extents in all
cultures. Hence, accurate quantitative data was not obtained and did not
support the stark observation seen in well plate format (prior to fixation).
Hence, this experiment has several motives:

  * To demonstrate proof of concept for MMC using the optimised MMC concentration (120 mg/ml) in a larger vessel (4CF). 
  * Generate quantitative data for biomass difference between treated and non-treated cultures by comparing weights (g) between the groups.
  * To determine observable/sensory differences between MMC treated and non-treated cell monolayers (e.g. colour, thickness, taste)

DateTaskNotes  
12th August 2022

  * Make up 2 x 600ml of PRF serum free adherent media for seeding.
  * Secure 2 x 4CF and bring into main lab.
  * Make 2L of Ficoll 70 media (120 mg/ml)
  * Make 2L of serum free adherent media for seeding. 

  
  
15th August 2022

  * Obtain 100 million cells from cell supply.
  * Seed each 4CF at 50,000 cells/cm2 in PRF adherent media. Each 4CF will be seeded with 50 million cells each. Seed media will be 600mL total for each flask.

  
  
16th August 2022

  * Assign one 4CF to be the MMC treated flask and perform a 100% media change with 2L MMC media.
  * Perform a 100% media change of the non treated 4CF with 2L of PRF adherent media.

  
  
23rd August 2022

  * Wash out media from each flask.
  * Perform 3 x washes with Milli-Q water.
  * Trypilise cell sheets if they have not detached.
  * Wash sheet further if required.
  * Weigh, taste and record observations.

  


  
  
What constitutes a successful MMC product from this experiment?

  * Increase in biomass (weight (g))
  * Colour change during culture (not an essential but desirable). ECM rich products tend to generate a pale, off-white colour as learned from CHOMP batches previously at Vow and as observed in well plate format in DSD #3.
  * Positive change in texture (essential)
  * Taste (not an essential but desirable)

How will these be measured?

  * Weighing harvests side by side from each 4CF.
  * Observational changes in colour, texture, taste by visual inspection or eating.
  * Weights and comprehensive pictures will be supplied.
