Growth Media:

  * [ X]  DMEM + 10% FBS + 1X P/S




### Process:

1\. Took image of vessel with microscope on phase setting.

3\. Aliquotted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then
placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath for a minimum of 20 minutes
prior to use:

  1. TrypLE:    30     mL in      1   tube
  2.  dPBS (for washing and neutralising):     30    mL in    2    tubes
  3. Growth media (for pellet resuspension):       3  mL in      1   tubes
  4. Growth media (for seeding):      90   mL in      1   tubes

Time that all aliquots were placed in the water bath the warm before use
15:22 pm

Note: if aliquots were placed in water bath at different time, record the time
stamp for each individual solution.




4\. Removed vessel(s) from the incubator   13:36 pm

5\. Washed the vessel(s) with dPBS (warmed).

6\. Added    10     mL tryple to each vessel/well and incubated at 37˚C.

  1. Start/Finish for TrypLE was   13:41 - 13:51 pm 

7\. Neutralised with     10mL/flask     dPBS and combined cell suspension into
a    2   tubes.

8\. Centrifuged at 650 x g for 5 min.

  1. Start/Finish time for centrifugation was    13:55 pm 




9\. Aspirated the supernatant(s).

10\. Resuspended pellet(s) in    3    mL     Growth     media    16:02  pm

11\. Aliquoted     10uL     of resuspended cells into a microcentrifuge tube
for cell count.

12\. Performed a cell count using the haemocytometer and recorded the cell
count data in the Google Doc spreadsheet called 'Cell Count Spreadsheet' (see
link below):

SSIBtIylyrBQE5kRX5Z8NtI/edit#gid=0

  1.  Total cell number was:       1.2M      

  2. Volume of cell suspension required for subculture was:       all      

  3. Cell density per vessel:      1 x T175      




13\. Transferred       remaining    µl of cell suspension to the pre-warmed
30     mL Growth media:

14\. Transferred cell suspension into      1 x T175     vessel.

16\. Transferred vessel(s) to incubate at:  16:15 pm  

  * [ X]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (avian cells)

Observations/Summary:

\- MOCHA cells passaged into 1 x T175 flask seeded at 7K cells / cm2

  




SOPs used:

###  




### Results:

  * Results were;
    * [ X]  As Usual (this is a repetitive task)
    * [ X]  Unexpected because... cell numbers are decreasing. Might need to contact supplier of cell line
    * [ ]  Need to be further analysed
    * [ ]  Other (.......)
