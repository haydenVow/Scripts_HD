Growth Media (for resuspension):

  * [x]  DMEM/F12 + 20% FBS + 1X P/S + 10uM P38i




Process:

 1\. Aliquotted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and
then placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath for a minimum of 20 minutes
prior to use:

  1.  TrypLE:  250mL in | 1x250mL | container
  2.  dPBS (for neutralising)    2x250mL in | 2x250mL | containers
  3.  Growth media (for pellet resuspension):   20 mL in | 1x50mL | tubes 
  4.  Time that all aliquots were placed in the water bath to warm before use:    14:00 a/pm 

Note: if aliquots were placed in water bath at different times, record the
time stamp for each individual solution.

Gelatin coated 6 wells on a 96 well plate (B2-B4, C2-C4), place plate to
incubate at 37 degrees, 5% C02.




1\. Removed the flask from the incubator, emptied supernatant by pouring into
a waste container.  

2\. Added 250mL of dPBS to the vessel to wash cells.

3\. Removed dPBS wash as per protocol in step 1.

4\. Added | 250 |mL tryple to each vessel/well and incubated at 37ºC for | 15
| min. [14:24-14:39]

4a Poured tryple from the flask into a 250mL corning container, split the
volume across 10x 50mL tubes.

5\. Added  | 250 | dPBS (warmed) to the empty 5CF, swirled and washed the
flask, poured the contents back into a 250mL container then combined  withcell
suspensions in  | 50mL | tubes.

6\. Centrifuged at 650 x g for 5 min

  1.  Start/Finish time for centrifugation was:   14:45 - 14:50 a/pm   




6\. Aspirated the supernatant(s).

7\. Resuspend pellet(s) in | 11.2 |mL | growth | media.

8\. Performed a cell count using the haemocytometer and recorded the cell
count data in the Google Doc spreadsheet called 'Cell Count Spreadsheet' (see
link below):

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1DPzKubYxfHmWogVPihC-
SSIBtIylyrBQE5kRX5Z8NtI/edit#gid=0&range=1127:1127

9\. Total cell number was: | 17,526,000 |

9a. Added 1.24mL of growth media leftover from the resuspension media to a
15mL tube.

9b. Added 20uL of counted cell suspension (31,000 cells) to the 1.24mL of
growth media. Removed gelatin from the wells on the gelatin coated 96 well
plate and replaced with 200uL of this mixed cell suspension (5000 cells/well),
placed in the incubator at 37 degrees, 5% CO2 [15:40], incubator 67.

10\. Calculated the required volume cell suspension & freeze medium to
generate a concentration of ~1M cells/mL. (17.5mL




11\. Prepared   20mL Freeze Medium: (FBS + 10% DMSO). ID # 4975  

Stored at 4ºC until use to keep chilled.

12\. Centrifuged cells at 650 x g for 5 min.  15:20  \-  15:25  a/pm

Whilst centrifuge is spinning, prepared & printed vial labels, labelled
cryovials. (Note that passage number will be the same as the culture you
harvest from. The passage number will increase by 1 during the revive of a
vial.)




13\. Aspirated supernatant carefully, taking care not to disturb the pellet.

14\. Resuspended the pellet in | 17.5 |mL freeze media (chilled, to reduce
DMSO toxicity).

15\. Aliquotted | 500uL |µL into | 34 | x cryovials (already labelled).

16\. Tightened the lids & transfer the cryovials to a Mr. Frosty immediately
into the -80ºC freezer.   16:10   a/pm

  * [x]  With foam
  * [ ]  Without foam
  * [ ]  1st Freeze
  * [ ]  2nd Freeze
  * [ ]  3rd Freeze
  * [ ]  4th Freeze
  * [ ]  5th Freeze

17\. Allow the cells to freeze for at least 18-24 hours before transferring to
Liquid Nitrogen storage.

Observations/Summary:

Decided to seed a Diff assay following the procedure undertaken in the
following study:
https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1096717620301208?via%3Dihub.
The procedure involves the following.

  * Growing the cells in Growth media (in the paper this is DMEM + 10% FBS + 1% anthomycin) until 70% confluence.
  * Media is then left unchanged over 7 days before fixing with 4% PFA and stained with Primary MHC antibodies to 4 μ g/mL in blocking solution (4% goat serum in dPBS). 
  * We will modify the protocol to use our regular growth media but induce 7 days of starvation once the wells appear to be 70% confluent.
