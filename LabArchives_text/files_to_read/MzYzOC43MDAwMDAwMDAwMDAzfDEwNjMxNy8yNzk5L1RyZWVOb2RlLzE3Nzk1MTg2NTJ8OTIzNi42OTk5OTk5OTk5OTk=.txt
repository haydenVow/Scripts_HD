  8. Aspirated supernatant, taking care to not disrupt or aspirate pellet 
  9. Re-suspended pellet in 500 uL growth media
  10. Took 2 x 10 uL aliquots from cell suspension
  11. Performed cell count
    * Count: 106,000
    * Count 2: 76,000
    * Average: 91,000
  12. Replaced with 25 mL fresh, warmed media
