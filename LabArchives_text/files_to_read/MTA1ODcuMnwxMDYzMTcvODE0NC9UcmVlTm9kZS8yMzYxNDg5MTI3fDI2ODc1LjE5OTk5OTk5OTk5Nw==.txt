*Prepare:

  1. 200 mL x 90/10 RPMI/Hycell + Nuvonis
  2. 200 mL x 100% Hycell + Nuvonis  
  

  3. Aliquot 10 x 20mL of each media into a sterile container and add growth factors
  4. Seed 10 x E-125 with 1M cells each from 90/10 RPMI/Hycell (from Lily's experiment) into 90/10 RPMI/Hycell and 10 x E-125 with 1M cells each from 100% Hycell + Nuvonis into 100% Hycell.
