The protocol used for this experiment is based on a phased differentiation
strategy previously used for pluripotent stem cells (Chal et al. 2016
https://sci-hub.yncjkj.com/10.1038/nprot.2016.110). This approach may be
promising as a phased approach may better recapitulate normal biological
conditions whereby muscle differentiation involves the transition between
multiple different cell subtypes in response to different signalling
molecules.
