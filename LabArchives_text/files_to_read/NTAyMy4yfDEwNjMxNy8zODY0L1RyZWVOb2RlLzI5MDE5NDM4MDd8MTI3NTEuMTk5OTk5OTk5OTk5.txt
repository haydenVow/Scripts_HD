Aim: To measure maturation in DOLLY12 cells using Bradford and Lowry assays
Hypothesis: Both Bradford and Lowry assays will measure total protein content as a measure of maturation
Background:


Currently at Vow, we do not have a robust way to measure to measure MuSC
maturation on our scaffolds. Previously, antibody capture methods to detect
myogenin and myosin heavy chain (II) such as immunofluorescence and ELISA have
been tried and tested with minimal success. In both methods, the antibody is
largely retained by the scaffold giving rise to non-specific binding. The
current working theory is that porous structural network of the scaffold
provides cavities and crevices for the antibody to be retained in despite
repeated washing steps.  
  
The Bradford and Lowry protein quantification assays are commonly used to
measure total protein content. While these methods circumvent the issue of
antibody retention - they bring added complications due to the need of having
to remove cells off scaffolds, lyse and purify protein. Lysing and purifying
protein while is straightforward, having to remove cells of scaffolds may turn
out to be a complicated endeavour. Moreover, if removing cells of scaffolds is
succesful, antibody detection methods might as well be used to quantify
maturation markers (Myogenin, MHC II) instead of having to undergo the process
of lysing and purification for Bradford/Lowry.

Based on the findings and results of the first iteration of the Bradford assay
(see: https://au-
mynotebook.labarchives.com/share/Vow%2520-%2520Team%2520Science/NDg4MC4yfDEwNjMxNy8zNzU0L1RyZWVOb2RlLzI4NTY5Nzk4ODd8MTIzODguMTk5OTk5OTk5OTk5)
some improvements will be made to the process to obtain more precise results.

These improvements will include:

\- A better method to harvest cells from well plates for analysis (without a
detachment protein)

\- Keeping lysates cold at all times by using an ice bath.

  

  


Plan:


Brief overview

  * Seed 6 wells of 2 x 24 well plates with C2C12 cell line.
  * Analyse protein content of plate 1 using the Bradford assay on Day 0 (no differentation).
  * Analyse protein content of plate 2 using the Bradford assay on Day 6 (full differentation and maturation acheived).

Preparing BSA standard curve:

  * Make up stock of 2 mg/ml BSA solution
  * Perform serial dilutions to make up 2000, 1500, 1000, 750, 500, 250, 125, 25 ug/ml solutions of BSA. Place on ice.

Improved freeze-thaw lysis method:

  * Remove E6 from wells and wash multiple times with PBS to remove serum proteins that may affect analysis.
  * Place the plate directly in LN2 bath for 3 minutes.
  * Thaw in water bath for 3 minutes.
  * Repeat process 3 more times.
  * Ensure detachment by loading 10uL of lysate under haemocytometer slide. Keep plate on ice during this process.
  * Transfer lysate to microcentrifuge tubes.
  * Wash wells with 500uL PBS and transfer wash to tube.
  * Centrifuge tube/s at 650g for 5 mins.
  * Aspirate 100uL of supernatant and transfer to corresponding well on a fresh non treated 96 well plate. Keep plate cold by placing on ice.
  * Perform dilutions in the well plate using water or PBS (ensure that whichever one that is used is also used as the blank) as the diluent.
  * In a new 96 well plate, add 250uL bradford reagent to the corresponding wells.
  * Add 5uL of the sample to each of the corresponding wells.
  * Mix well and spin plate down for 5 mins to remove bubbles (also the incubation time).
  * Read at 595 using plate reader.

Calculations/Analysis:

  * Prepare graph of standards (mg/ml on x axis, Abs on y axis)
  * Calculate protein concentration using C1V1 = C2V2 (do not factor in amount of Bradford reagent added)
