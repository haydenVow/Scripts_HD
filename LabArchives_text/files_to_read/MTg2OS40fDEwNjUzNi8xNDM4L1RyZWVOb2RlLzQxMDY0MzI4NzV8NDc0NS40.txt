Procedure




CULTURE CONTAMINATED

  * Culture visibly contaminated with bacteria. Pumped in 2.4L of sodium hypochlorite (5g/L), let this sit for 60min and then pumped this into the waste IBC.
  * The bag was then disposed of an some parts were removed to be cleaned and re-used.

POSSIBLE SOURCES OF CONTAMINATION:

  * The media pumped into the bioreactor was highly contaminated, this was not noticed until after multiple filters became blocked. 
    * However the media in the bioreactor looked clear by eye and under the microscope even on the night of 25/05
  * The same bottle was used to transfer the cells and growth factors into the bioreactor, this bottle had also been used once before for adding growth factors but had been kept sterile. With so many uses this is a possible source
  * It was the first time LP AS and CB operated the bioreactor and performed these procedures without supervision, it is possible that something was missed leading to contamination risks
