Note

I have observed slow growth rates of all embryonic lines once passaged into
T175. I theorise that this is likely due to the flasks themselves which do not
have vent caps. It is likely that there has not been adequate gas exchange
(despite loosening the lids to facilitate this). The fact that cultures in
OptiPRO medium have been doing better than the other cultures in these flasks
supports this theory as OptiPRO contains HEEPES buffer whereas the others do
not. To assess if cells will proliferate more rapidly in flasks with vented
caps, some of the cells harvested today will not be banked, and instead will
be continued in culture for another few days in T75 flask, for which we have
vented caps.




## Performed by: Brodie Peace with guidance from Bonnie Tangey




Perform bank using below volumes

  




Observation of JUMBO cultures prior to bank.

JUMBOK was 60% confluent and contained a lot of debris with a number of cells
with senescent morphology. JUMBOF cells were largely senescent in appearance,
and 50% confluent. JUMBOO was 100% confluent, and cells appear healthy.  




Process

 1\. Aliquoted reagents and placed in the cell culture incubator to warm for a
minimum of 30 minutes prior to use:

  1. T75 flask were pre-filled with 12mL of growth media per flask and placed in the incubator to warm and to equilibrate. 2x flasks were filled for each of the 3 media types. 
  2. TrypLE:  50mL 
  3. dPBS (for washing and neutralising)   110mL 
  4. Media (for pellet resuspension):  10mL (of each media)
  5. Discarded spent media
  6. Washed each flask with 10mL PBS
  7. Added 10mL of Tryple to each flask and incubated for 10min
  8. Added 10mL PBS to each flask to nuetralise
  9. Transferred cell suspensions to 50mL falcon tubes
  10. Centrifuged at 500g for 5min




Process post centrifugation.

  1.  Aspirated the supernatant(s). 
  2. Resuspend pellet(s) in |10ml (JUMBOO) or 5mL (JUMBOK and JUMBOF)respective growth medias| 
  3. Performed a cell count using the haemocytometer and recorded the cell count data in the Google Doc spreadsheet called 'Cell Count Spreadsheet' https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1DPzKubYxfHmWogVPihC-SSIBtIylyrBQE5kRX5Z8NtI/edit#gid=0  
Total cell number was: | 1.95M (JUMBOK), 63.9M (JUMBOO), 4.5M (JUMBOF)|

  4. 1M cells were taken from JUMBOK and JUMBOF cell suspension and seeded into 1 x pre-filled T75 flask each. 2M cells were taken form JUMBOO and seeded into 2x T75 flasks (13.33M cells/cm)
  5. The remaining cells were centrifuged at approx. 500g for 5min.
  6. Supernatant removed and cell pellets resuspended in chilled Cryostor CS10 transferred into cyrovials as follows  
JUMBOO 12.4mL (5M cells/mL) - In 12vials  
JUMBOK 1mL (1M cells/mL)- In 1 vial  
JUMBOF  3mL (1M cells/mL) - In 3 vials

  7. Transfered the cryovials to a Mr. Frosty immediately into the -80ÂºC freezer.

  8. Allowed the cells to freeze for at least 18-24 hours before transferring to Liquid Nitrogen storage.
