Process:

  1. Carefully removed media from well plates and washed cell layer in PBS.
  2. Removed PBS from wells and added 200uL of 4% PFA.
  3. Incubated with PFA for 15 minutes

12654 - 10:35am - 10:50am

12655 - 10:31am - 10:46am

12656 - 10:27am - 10:42am

  1. Removed PFA and washed once with PBS.
  2. Added 1% Sirius Red solution to each well and left for 30 mins at RT.

  1. Removed stain and added 1M NaOH to each well and incubated for 2 hours to solubilise the stain ( : )

  1. Quantify the supernatant from each well at Abs 540nm on the Spectrostar Nano. An endpoint absorbance setting of 540nm was used for the whole plate. No plate shaking was used, ensured no bubbles were present in the wells and lid was removed.




Observations/Summary:

Collagen assay is simple and direct for use in well plates.  
For one of the three replicates, a distinct red gradient is seen peaking
towards the bottom right of the well plate which contains the highest
concentration of the MMC combination. This would indicate the highest
combination of the crowders produce the most collagen. However the other 2
replicates observationally do not contain any such gradient and all wells seem
to have the same colour.
