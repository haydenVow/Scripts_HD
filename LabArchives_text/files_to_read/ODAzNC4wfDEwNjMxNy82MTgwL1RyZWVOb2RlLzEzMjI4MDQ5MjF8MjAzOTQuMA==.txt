Prepare materials for thaw and seed:

1\. Aliquoted:

  * Growth medium (for feed):   30 mL in 1 x50 mL tube 
    * Time that aliquots were placed in the water bath (set to 30ºC) to warm before use:  16:05

  




## Feed cells

1\. Removed media from flask pouring off the supernatant into the waste bin.

2\. added 30 mL prewarmed media back into the flask.  

3\. [16:35] Transferred plates to incubate in incubator #68 at:

  * [ ]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (avian cells)
  * [X] 30ºC, 5% CO2 (reptilian cells)




There was a lot of dead cells and cell debris in the supernatant of the flask,
so the entire supernatant was poured off and the flask was fed with 30mL of
fresh media to ensure no debris would be present in the culture going forward.
