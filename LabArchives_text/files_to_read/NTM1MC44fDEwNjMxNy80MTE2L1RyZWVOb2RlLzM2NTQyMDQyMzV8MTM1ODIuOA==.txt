Protocol run:

Zaber scanned wells on 5x. Finished at 15:00 and returned plate to incubator.

  * DAPI: exposure 50
    * Wells stained with new Hoechst were brighter than they were yesterday and more easy to distinguish from background. Their fluorescence was now similar to the old Hoechst.
  * Phase: exposure 40

96 wp with growth media placed in incubator: 16:18

Plate/s taken out from incubator:   16:46

Start run: 4:50:25 PM  

Run time: 2:07:49  

Plate/s returned to incubator:

plate 8123: 19:21

plate 8206:  19:47




Observations/Summary:

Passaged wells that were stained with 60uL/mL of new Hoechst in PBS solution
and unstained wells from 384 wp to 96 wp.

Note that the concentration and volume of Hoechst used for these wells yields
a final concentration of ~17uL/mL

indicates wells that were Hoechst stained.
