Note  
At last imaging on 14/08/21, most cultures contained very few cells, with none
attached to vessels. Cultures 7724 and 7725 had a large number of unattached
cells floating in media however. It was decided that these cultures should be
split, with half the cells being seeded to a gelatin coated well, and the
other half remaining in the uncoated well. This will provide the opportunity
to collect any potential muscle cells in the non-adherent population, while
still giving any remaining fibroblasts further opportunity to adhere to
plastic.  
  
As all other cultures contained very few cells, they will not be split at this
stage.

Reagent preparation  
1\. Collect aliquot  3 mL DMEM/F12 +20% FBS +1x p/S . Placed in water bath to
warm to 30 degrees  

2\. Collect aliquot  3 mL DMEM/F12 +20% FBS +1x p/S . Placed in water bath to
warm to 37 degrees  
3\. Collect aliquot  3 mL M199 +20% FBS +1x p/S . Placed in water bath to warm
to 30 degrees

Process

1\. Gelatin coat 1 well in 2x24-well plates with 0.1% gelatin and placed in
the incubator at 37 C. 10:54

2\. Gelatin coated third 24-well plates with 0.1% gelatin and placed in
incubator at 37 C. 11:30

3\. Imaged all cultures listed in the table above.  

  

  




Split cultures (7723, 7724 and 7725 only).

  1. Remove cultures 7723, 7724 and 7725 from the incubator. 
  2. Mix the media gently in the well before removing half (1.5mL) and transferring a pre-coated well of the 24-well plates (keep cells from 7723, 7724 and 7725 separate)
  3. Transfer the remaining 1.5ML of from 7724 and 7725 to separate non-coated wells of a 24 well plate (giving us 4 new plates in total)
  4. Add 3mL of fresh DMEM/F12 +20% FBS +1x p/s to plate 7723 & 7724 and 3mL of fresh M199 +20% FBS +1x p/s to plate 7725 (just in case there are attached cells left behind we will keep them going for a few more days)
  5. Return vessel to incubate at: 7724 & 7725 - 12:04, 7723 -  12:47  

  *  30ÂºC, 5% CO2 or 37'C, 5%CO2  




Observations:

Cultures 7724 and 7725 contain cells, however far less than on Saturday based
on images

Culture 7723 also contains a decent number of cells
