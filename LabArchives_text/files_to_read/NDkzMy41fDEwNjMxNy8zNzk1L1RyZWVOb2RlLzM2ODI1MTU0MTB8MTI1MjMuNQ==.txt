Data from day 4, 7, 11, 18, 21, 28, 32, 35 and 39 was used. Data from day 14
and 25 was excluded due to the presence of blue florescent debris which would
have resulted in inaccurate cell counts.

Images taken on DAPI and AF488 channels were processed through MIA to obtain
cell counts via the 'Suspension DAPI cell count' and 'Suspension AF488 cell
count' macros.

Raw cell counts from MIA were entered into the excel sheet attached to
calculate the total cells/mL (DAPI) and dead cells/mL (AF488). These were then
entered into a the following google spreadsheet:

zrb1c/edit#gid=522529401

The average total cell count/mL  was used for visualisation and further
analysis in GraphPad Prism.
