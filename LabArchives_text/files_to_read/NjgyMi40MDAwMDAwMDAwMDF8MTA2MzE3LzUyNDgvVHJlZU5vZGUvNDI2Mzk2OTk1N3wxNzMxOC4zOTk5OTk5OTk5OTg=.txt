Background

5 salt water crocodile biopsies (CHOMP01-CHOMP05) were recently collected
(from a single animal), processed into raw homogenate and cryopreserved. See
lab books here: https://au-

Here, we attempt to establish a plastic adherent cell population derived from
the homogenate of 1 of these frozen biopsies, CHOMP01. The media formulation
we plan to use ill be based upon the previous successful culture of
crocodilian fibroblasts by Hyndman, T.H., et al [1]
