A dry-heat oven purchased on Amazon was calibrated as follows:  
  
Calibration process:  
  
A heat probe was placed in the dry-heat oven and the oven turned on set to
150'C for one hour, the temperature was then recorded at regular intervals
over the hour:

10:45 22'C  
10:48  39'C  
10:50  57'c  
11:02   85'C  
11:05  84'C  
11:06   88'C  
11:10   96'C  
11:11    95'C  
11:14    90'C  
11:15    86'C  
11:20    95'C  
11:30   88'C  
11:36   91'C  
11:42    93'C

Observations:

It is clear from the temperature readings that the temperature did not achieve
the 150'C temperature setting. The highest temperature reached was 96'C. Not
an adequate sterilisation temperature.  
  
It could be that due to the presence of the wire under the lid that hot air is
escaping during heating and effecting the temperature.  
  
As a second test autoclave tape was placed inside the oven attached to some
foil and the oven turned on set to 150'C for one hour, after one hour the
autoclave tape showed the black lines (more faint than after an autoclave
sample) suggesting that 121'C was reached (the temperature required for colour
change)
