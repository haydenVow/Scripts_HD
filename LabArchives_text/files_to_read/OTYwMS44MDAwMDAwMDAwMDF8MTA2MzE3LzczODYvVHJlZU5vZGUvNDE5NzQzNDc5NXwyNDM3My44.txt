AIM/PURPOSE: Determine if treating Nuvonis quail fibroblast suspension cells
with Vitamin C (50 ug/mL) results in an increase in mass yield

HYPOTHESIS: Addition of Vitamin C during the 8 day culturing period of the
Nuvonis suspension cells will result in an increase in pellet weight following
harvesting

RESULTS SUMMARY:

Figure 1: Weight of harvested Nuvonis cell pellets. Each data point represents
an individual sample with the average calculated from replicate samples (n=8)
+/- SEM.

CONCLUSIONS:

No significant difference in pellet weight was observed between the control
and vitamin C seeded conditions after 4 and 8 days in continuous culture.

NEXT STEPS:

  * Increase the duration the cells are cultured in Vitamin C, >14 days.
  * Treat cultures with cell density >1M cells/mL with Vitamin C over an extended period, > 14 days.
