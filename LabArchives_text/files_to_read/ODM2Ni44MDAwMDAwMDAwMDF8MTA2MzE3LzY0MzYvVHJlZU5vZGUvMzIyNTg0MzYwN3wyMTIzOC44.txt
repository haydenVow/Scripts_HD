Prepare materials for thaw and seed:

  * NOTE: IF PERFORMING A THAW FROM A CLONAL MCB_2 OR WCB_2, PREPARE AT LEAST ONE EXTRA 96 WELL PLATE FOR A DIFFERENTIATION ASSAY. THIS IS AN IMPORTANT QUALITY CONTROL STEP WHILE WE BUILD OUR CLONAL CELL BANK.
  * Suggested layout for diff assay (please refer to previous diff assays for exact seeding, feeding and analysis procedures)  

  * 

1\. Gelatin coated  8  x  T175  flasks/plates with sterile filtered 0.1%
gelatin solution and then incubated all coated flasks at 37ºC

  * Time when all flasks placed into the incubator   9:48 am 

2\. Aliquotted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then
placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath for a minimum of 20 minutes
prior to use:

  *  Growth media (for seeding):   2x 120 mL 
  * Time that aliquot was placed in the water bath to warm before use:  10 : 07 am 

  




## Thaw and seed vial - C2C12 (#3015):

3\. Collected the cryovial from Liquid Nitrogen storage & place in foam
floater in water bath for 5 min 16:03-16:08  

Location where cryovial was collected from:

Vial details:  1   x  C2C12  cryovials at  1 M  cells each for a total of   1
M cells  

Brew

Tower/Bucket # 3

Box/Cane # 3

Vial location:I8

Vial ID(s):3013

`4. Ethanol sprayed & transferred the vial(s) to the BSC.`````

``

`5.  Added 500 µL of Growth Media (to generate a total volume of 1mL in the
cryovial) to the cryovial, resuspended the cell suspension gently to reduce
osmotic shock. `

`6. Collected 500 uL of cell suspension & transfer into the pre-warmed tube of
Growth Media, discarded remaining.  
`

`7. Using a 10mL serological pipette, resuspended & distributed the cells
evenly in the  120 mL of pre-warmed Growth Media (prepared in Step 2). `

`8. Transferred  30 mL to each pre-coated  T175  flask/well, allow to rest in
the BSC at RT for 30 min  16:18-16:48  
`

`9. Transferred flask/plate(s) to incubate at: 16:50`

  * [X]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (aviary cells)

  

Making labels

Note - You will need to increase the passage number by one. (i.e. if your
thawed vial ID has a passage number of 3, when you make a culture ID for you
vessel you will need change the passage number to 4 on Airtable.)

  




## Thaw and seed vial - BUFFY6 (#1875):

3\. Collected the cryovial from Liquid Nitrogen storage & place in foam
floater in water bath for 5 min  16:03-16:08  

Location where cryovial was collected from:

Vial details:  1   x  BUFFY6  cryovials at  500 K  cells each for a total of
500 K  cells

Brew

Tower/Bucket # 6

Box/Cane # 6

Vial location: B4  

Vial ID(s):1866

`4. Ethanol sprayed & transferred the vial(s) to the BSC.`

`5.  Added 500 µL of Growth Media (to generate a total volume of 1mL in the
cryovial) to the cryovial, resuspended the cell suspension gently to reduce
osmotic shock. `

`6. Collected the entire 1mL of cell suspension & transfer into the pre-warmed
tube of Growth Media. `

`7. Using a 10mL serological pipette, resuspended & distributed the cells
evenly in the  120 mL of pre-warmed Growth Media (prepared in Step 2). `

`8. Transfered  30 mL to each pre-coated T175   flask/well, allow to rest in
the BSC at RT for 30 min  16:16-16:46  
`

`9. Transfered flask/plate(s) to incubate at: 16:50`
