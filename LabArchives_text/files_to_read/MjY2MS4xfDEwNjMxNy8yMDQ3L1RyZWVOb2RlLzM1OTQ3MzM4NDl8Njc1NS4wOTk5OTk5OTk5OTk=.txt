7223-DOLLY12-Sheep P13-2of2  
Fibroblast ECM scaffolds seeded with MuSC  
  
Cell FreeAll scaffolds from both of these plates have been combined onto one
48-well plate (see new plate above) however the two separate IDs were retained
to distinguish between the two conditions, i.e. either seeded with MuSC or
cell free  
  
  
  




Process:

1\. Filled wells of new 48WP with inserts with 1 mL of E6 media growth media
(according to plate map). Moved plate to incubator. Timestamp: 15:00

2\. Retrieved culture plate from incubator.

3\. Using sterile tweezers, moved scaffolds across to 48WP with inserts
containing fresh, warm media.

4\. Returned new plate to incubate at:

  * [x]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (aviary cells)

  

  * Incubator (Thermo), Lab [Main]

### Observations/Summary:

100  % media changed on vessel(s)

  1. 7222-DOLLY12-Sheep P13-1of2
  2. 7223-DOLLY12-Sheep P13-2of2  
  

\- It appeared that the scaffolds were slightly smaller in size compared to
the previous day, however it may just be the illusion of the scaffolds sitting
in the 48-well plate inserts.




Results:

  * Results were;
    * [x]  As Usual (this is a repetitive task)
    * [ ]  Unexpected because... it worked
    * [ ]  Need to be further analysed
    * [ ]  Other (.......)
