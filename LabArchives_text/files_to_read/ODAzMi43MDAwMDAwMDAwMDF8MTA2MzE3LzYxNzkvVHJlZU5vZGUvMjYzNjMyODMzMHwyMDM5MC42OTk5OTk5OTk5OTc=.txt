Process

  1. Collected E125s from shaker, wiped with ethanol-sprayed Rediwipe, and brought into BSC 
  2. Using a 25 mL serelogical pipette, gently pipette-mixed culture to break up cell clumps
  3. Transfer suspension into 50 mL tubes. Kept E125 vessels in BSC, as culture will be returned to these vessels after feed. 
  4. Centrifuged 50 mL tubes at 300 x g for 5 min             
    * Spin 1:  

  5. Aspirated ~100% of supernatant, taking extra care to not disrupt or aspirate pellet 
  6. Added 0.5mL of sterile dPBS to each falcon tube. Resuspended pellet in dPBS and transferred each to new  labelled 1.5mL eppendorf tube. Eppendorf tubes labelled with:
    * Culture ID
    * Date
  7. Rinsed each 50mL falcon tube with 0.5mL sterile dPBS and deposited into corresponding 1.5mL eppendorf tube
  8. Spun samples in benchtop centrifuge at 4500xg for 10 minutes
  9. Aspirated ~100% of supernatant without disturbing the pellet
  10. Snap froze pellets on liquid nitrogen (submerged pellet for ~20 seconds)
  11. Stored at -80degC freezer in specimen jar labelled with EPIC ID
