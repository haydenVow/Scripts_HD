NOTE

The 'raw isolate' cells used for this expansion had actually been pre-plated
and expanded prior to freezing (banked at 32M cells). They would already be
considered an MCB by Vows current procedures for MCB/WCB expansion. It was not
until writing this report that I realised these cells were not actually raw
isolate as I initially thought- Bonnie.

      NOTE: The high doubling time of cell at P4-P5 is likely due to cells being passaged just 2 days apart.
