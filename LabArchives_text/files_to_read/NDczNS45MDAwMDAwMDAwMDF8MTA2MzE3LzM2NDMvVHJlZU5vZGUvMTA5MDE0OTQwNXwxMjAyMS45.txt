Performed by: LL  




Process

1\. Each of the cultures listed in the table bellow has 1 well filled. Image
each culture on 10x magnification, then passage culture 7721 only.

### Process:

1\. Took image of vessel with microscope on phase setting.

3\. Aliquotted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then
placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath for a minimum of 20 minutes
prior to use:

  1. TrypLE:     2    mL in      1   tubes
  2.  dPBS (for neutralising):     2    mL
  3.  dPBS (for washing):       2  mL
  4. Growth media (for pellet resuspension):     2    mL
  5. Growth media (for seeding):     10    mL 

Time that all aliquots were placed in the water bath the warm before use
10:26  

Note: if aliquots were placed in water bath at different time, record the time
stamp for each individual solution.




4\. Removed vessel(s) from the incubator   10:55  

5\. Washed the vessel(s) with dPBS (warmed).

6\. Added   2  mL tryple to each vessel/well and incubated at 30ËšC.

  1. Start/Finish for TrypLE was   10:58 - 11:09    

7\. Neutralised with   2 mL   dPBS and combined cell suspension into a     1 x
15mL    tube.

8\. Centrifuged at 650 x g for 5 min.

  1. Start/Finish time for centrifugation was   11:12 - 11:17 




9\. Aspirated the supernatant(s).

10\. Resuspended pellet(s) in   0.5  mL   growth   media

11\. Aliquoted   10 uL  of resuspended cells into a microcentrifuge tube for
cell count.

12\. Performed a cell count using the haemocytometer and recorded the cell
count data in the Google Doc spreadsheet called 'Cell Count Spreadsheet' (see
link below):

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1DPzKubYxfHmWogVPihC-
SSIBtIylyrBQE5kRX5Z8NtI/edit#gid=0

  1. Total cell number was:     214,000    

  2. Volume of cell suspension required for subculture was:       used all (500 uL)     

  3. Cell density per vessel:    7K/cm (seeded at 8.56K/cm2)    

13\. Added cell suspension to 5 mL of growth medium

14\. Seeded 1 x 25 with 5 mL x cell suspension

15\. Place in incubator #78 (library lab, bottom binder). Time: 11:33

 ~~13.  ~~ ~~Added cell suspension into 240mL of growth media.  ~~

 ~~14\. Seeded 8 x T175 by adding 30 mL of resuspended cells in media into
each T175~~

 ~~15\. Placed in incubator at time (Library - top binder)~~
