Process:

1\. Removed plate from fridge (incubated in primary antibodies overnight).

2\. Washed 3 times for 5 min with PBS at RT.

 13:47 - 13:50 a/pm

 13:54 - 13:56 a/pm

 13:57 - 14:00 a/pm

3\. Incubated the cells with secondary antibody mixture in the dark at RT for
1 hour.  14:04 - 15:04 a/pm

NOTE: from this step onwards protect from the light by wrapping plates in foil
and perform experiment in the dark.




Counter staining

1\.  Removed 2nd antibody solution.  15:06 a/pm

2\.  Washed with DAPI (1:1000) in PBS for 5 min at RT in the dark.

 15:07 - 15:12 a/pm

3\.  Washed in PBS 3 x 5 min at RT in the dark. (No Triton)

 15:13 - 15:16 a/pm

 15:18 - : a/pm

4\.  Replaced dPBS.

 : a/pm

5\. Confirmed staining on microscope by imaging.
