  1. Took 1 x 560 uL samples from each culture (1 x technical rep/flask).
  2. Performed counts using Vicell (560 uL/sample):

  3. Aliquotted 120 mL of 90/10 RPMI/CHO Part A + Nuvonis (some of the media will be used to feed the flasks in the slow adaptation experiment), and added 120uL of IGF and  24uL of EGF to it.
  4. Aliquotted the following mL of cell suspension into 2 x 50 mL tubes:

  5. Centrifuged the tubes @ 500 xg for 5 minutes.
  6. After centrifugation, aspirated the supernatant and resuspended cell pellet in 20 mL of medium. Then re-seeded flasks with the calculated volume of cell suspension.
  7. Replaced E125 in incubator at 37'C, 5% CO2, 120 RPM
