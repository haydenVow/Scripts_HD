This experiment is based on replicating the study performed by Stout et al
2021 (https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.05.28.446057v1.full). In
this paper, the authors created an ACF medium called Beefy-9 which consists of
B8 media with albumin. This was used for long term culture of bovine satellite
cells over seven passages. An average doubling rate of 39 hours was observed
during this period. The authors also describe a passaging protocol where
albumin is added 24 after seeding cells to allow cells to adhere. This media
would be a lot simpler to prepare than our current ACF media (E810C) as it has
less ingredients. Therefore, it would likely be cheaper as well. Additionally,
we have observed a substantial decrease in cell numbers when we switch our
cells to ACF media and it is possible that this medium, along with the
passaging protocol could reduce this issue.

Differences between the article and practices at Vow have been summarised in
the table below. It would be worthwhile to look into these further.
