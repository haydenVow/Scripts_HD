Process:

  1. Removed flask from incubator
  2. Mixed culture with p1000
  3. Took 100 uL sample, returned flask to incubator, and performed cell count:
    1. Count 1: (35 + 20 + 31 + 31 + 17)/5 = 26.8 cells per square x 10,000 squares/mL x 2 (dilution factor) = 0.536 million cells/mL x 200 mL = 107.2 million cells
    2. Count 2: (25 + 22 + 22 + 31 + 23)/5 = 24.6 cells per square x 10,000 squares/mL x 2 (dilution factor) =  0.492 million cells/mL x 200 mL = 98.4 million cells
    3. Average = 102.8 million cells
    4. Doubling time roughly 1 day
  4. Aliquotted   200 mL  mL of  __ Media directly into new flasks (100 mL per flask) at room temperature 11:40  

  5.  ~~Placed in water bath  ~~ ~~  12:35~~
  6. Removed flask from incubator
  7. Transferred 95 mL of culture to 2x E500 flasks, using serological pipettes and avoiding aspiration of aggregates
  8.  ~~Added with   180mL of warm growth medium~~
  9. Returned vessels to incubate at: 12:55
