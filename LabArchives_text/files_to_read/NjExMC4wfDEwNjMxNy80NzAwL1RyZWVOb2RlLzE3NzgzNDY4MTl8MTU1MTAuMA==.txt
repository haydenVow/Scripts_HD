Aim/Purpose : To analyse different nutritional compounds relevant to myoblast and differentiated (myotubes) cells
Hypothesis


We are able to determine the level of protein, lipids, B12, myoglobin and
more, in our myoblast and myotubes of different cell lines.


Technical Gap
Method/Procedure


Experimental plan

Proteomics and lipidomic - Harvest cells and freeze down

Day 10 (Thurs): Obtain myoblast from harvest

  * estimate of 2 mg for proteomics and 12 mg for lipodomic studies
  * After centrifuging cells, remove tryple/PBS and resuspend in growth media. 
  * Measure weight of 1 x 50 mL tube
  * Combine cell pellets into one the 50 mL tube and centrifuge 
  * Remove growth media and resuspend/wash cells in ice cold PBS
  * Centrifuge and remove  PBS 
  * Weigh 50 mL tube with cells and record cell mass
  * Divide into 1g samples and freeze at -80 

Day 7 - Day 21 (Mon): Obtain differentiated cells from harvest and keep in
culture for up to 14 days in E6

  * Repeat above steps with differentiated cells  
  
Send sample for proteomics and lipidomics

  

BCA assay - Harvest and seed plates

Day 4 or 7 (Friday or Monday)

  * Harvest cells 
  * Seed onto 1 x 24wp for bradford assay 
  * Allow to grow to confluency before performing assay 

  

Analyse of cells for specific nutrition compounds

  * B12 (waiting for kit to arrive)
  * Myoglobin (looking into bringing western blot in house or outsourcing)
