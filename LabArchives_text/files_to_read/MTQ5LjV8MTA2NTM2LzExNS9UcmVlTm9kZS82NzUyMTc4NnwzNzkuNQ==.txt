Procedure

  

### Note: Fibroblasts do NOT require Gelatin coated Flasks, and do NOT require
p38i.  
  

### Cell Harvest

  1. Turn on water bath and set temperature to 37C.
  2. Place new seeding flasks into the 37'C incubator to pre-warm.
  3. Take the flasks for harvest and observe under the microscope at 4x objective for even cell distribution . Refer to VSOP-006. Take 2-3 images per flask.
  4. Aliquot required volume of dPBS (37C), dPBS (ambient temp), TrypLE, and Growth Media in separate sterile pots. Refer to Table above for required volume.
  5. Place aliquots in pre-warmed water bath and leave for ~20 minutes or until warmed. Note: Ensure TrypLE is thoroughly warmed.  
`    Time stamp` : 09:40am  

  6. Transfer aliquots and flasks required for harvest into the BSC.
  7. Discard growth media from each flask.
  8. Wash with warmed dPBS, then discard.
  9. Add TrypLE to each of the flasks. Mix thoroughly to ensure coverage of the surface area.
  10. Place in the incubator at 37C. After 10 minutes, remove flasks from the incubator and agitate. Once agitation is complete, place back into the incubator.  
     NOTE: The flasks must be removed from the incubator within 18 minutes of initial incubation of TrypLE containing flasks.

  11. Aspirate the TrypLE solution and collect into 50mL centrifuge tubes(labelled).
  12. Using a serological pipette, dispense ambient temperature dPBS to create a final wash for each of the flasks. 
  13. Centrifuge at 650 x g for 5 minutes. ``

    2. last: 11:25 - 11:31pm
  14. Gently remove centrifuge tubes from the machine, ensuring not to disturb the suspended pellets. Aspirate the supernatant from the tubes. Discard supernatant. Remove as much remaining supernatant with a 1mL pipette.  
Cells are now harvested.

### Cell Count

  1. Following cell harvest and centrifugation, re-suspend the cell pellets. Use the table below to provide a rough estimation of the resuspension volume required.

### Cell Seeding

  1. Triturate the obtained cell suspension 10 times using a 5mL serological pipette to ensure a homogeneous cell suspension is obtained.
  2. Determine the required volume of suspension media (to achieve seeding density of about 7000 cells/cm2)  and dispense into pre-aliquoted growth media. Use Production Cell Count Calculator: VBLT-001, and record the values in the table above. 
  3. Transfer flasks from the incubator into the BSC.
  4. Transfer required growth media + cells into each flask.  Only half amount of media volume was added. Allow cells to settle before adding remaining media.  
`    End initial seeding time` : 13:16pm  

  5. Repeat the above step as many times as required until all flasks have been seeded with the media+cells.
  6. Transfer the flasks into the 37C incubator. Refer to Appendix 3 for incubation conditions.  
`    Incubation time` : 16:08pm

# Procedure

  1. Turn on the water bath and set to 37'C.
  2. Aliquot  required growth media and p38i into a sterile container/s and place into the water bath.
  3. Place in the water bath and heat for at least 20 minutes.
  4. Observe the cell flasks for confluence under the microscope using 4 x magnification and take images as required. Note: The confluence of cells must be <50% to perform cell feeding in P1-P3 and <80% in P4 prior to the cell differentiation stage. 
  5. Transfer flasks to the BSC and remove required volume of media from each flask (according to the Table above).
  6. Replace the same volume into each flask with the prepared growth media.
  7. Return the flasks to the incubator.
