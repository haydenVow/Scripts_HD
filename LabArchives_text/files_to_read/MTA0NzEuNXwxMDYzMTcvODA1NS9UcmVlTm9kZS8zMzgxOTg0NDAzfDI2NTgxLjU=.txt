Buffer preparation:

  * prepareed 100mL of 1% v/v acetic acid solution: 1mL acetic acid in 100mL dH2O
  * prepared buffers:
    * weighed out x2 lots of 240mg of chitosan
    * weighed out x2 lots of 80mg sodium alginate
    * prepared x4 tubes of 20mL of 1% acetic acid solution in 50mL falcon tubes and label "A" (nil), "B"(chitosan), "C" (chitosan+alginate) and "D" (alginate)
    * no additions to tube A
    * to tube B, added 240mg chitosan and mixed by vortex
    * to tube C, added 80mg alginate and mixed by vortex. Added 240mg chitosan. Mixed by vortex
    * to tube D, added 80mg alginate and mixed by vortex.

Notes:

  * added 1mL per 20mL tube to bring to 6mL/100mL (which is equivalent to 1M or 60ml/L or 6mL/100mL), solution already contained 0.2mL acid in 20mL
  * Liquid was viscous with many bubbles. Left to degas overnight. Can pipette most solutions - tested with 200uL draw using P1000

Serial dilution preparation:

  1. prepared x6 15mL falcon tubes. Labelled each 1.1, 1.2, 1.3 and 2.1, 2.2, and 2.3
  2. added the following volumes to the following tubes:

  * 1.1 4mL from B
  * 1.2 3mL from A
  * 1.3 3mL from A
  * 2.1 4mL from C
  * 2.2 3mL from D
  * 2.3 3mL from D

     3\. performed 1:4 serial dilution for both series, taking 1mL from x.1 and adding/mixing consecutively to each dilution

  

Notes: used 5mL syringe to dispense viscous liquids for depositing into tubes
and performing dilutions
