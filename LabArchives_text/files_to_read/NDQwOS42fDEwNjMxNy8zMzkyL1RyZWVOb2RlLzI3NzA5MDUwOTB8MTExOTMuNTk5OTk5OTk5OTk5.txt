#116Aliquots are in tubes labelled SUN on the lid. The percentage of MC is
written on the side of the tubes. The serum control, 0.45% and 1% MC
conditions have 35 mL of media in their aliquots. 5 mL is for the 50 mL spin
tube and the remaining 30 mL is for the E125 flask.

###  




Process:

  1. Place pre-aliquoted media vessel in water bath to be warmed.
  2. Placed in water bath:  08:30 am       

  3. Collected culture vessels from shakers, wiped with ethanol-sprayed cloth and brought into BSC (if necessary, paused shakers by pressing the "play" button on the controller on the side wall of the incubator)
  4. Using a p1000 for the 50 mL spin tube cultures and a 5 mL serological pipette for the E125 flasks, gently pipette-mixed cultures for ~1 minute to break up cell clumps
  5. Pipetted suspensions though 70 um cell strainer into 6 x 15 mL tubes  and 3 x 50 mL flasks (keep E125 flask and 50 mL tubes in BSC as cultures will be returned to these post centrifugation) 
  6. Centrifuged spin tubes at 300 x g for 5 min. Timestamp: 9:26 - 9:31    

  7. Centrifuged E-flasks at 300 x g for 5 min. Timestamp: 9:57 - 10:02
  8. Aspirated supernatants, taking care to not disrupt or aspirate pellet
  9. Re-suspended all cultures in their respective growth media.  
  10. Gently pipette-mixed cultures again before moving back to E125 flask and 50 mL tubes
  11. Returned vessels to incubator and replaced in clamp. If shaker was paused, remembered to press play to restart shaking. 50 mL spin tubes should be shaking at 206 RPM and E125 at 120 RPM) Timestamp:    spin tubes 9:44  E-flasks: 10:18
