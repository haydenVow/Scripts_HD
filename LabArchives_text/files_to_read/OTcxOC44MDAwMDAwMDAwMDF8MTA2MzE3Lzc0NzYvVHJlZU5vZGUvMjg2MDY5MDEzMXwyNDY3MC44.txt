Process
  
  
  1. Took 2 x 50 uL aliquots from e-flask culture and performed 2 x cell counts. 
    * Average cell count was: 18M (using Freestyle cells because RPMI/HyCell cells have performed inconsistently over past week) 
  2. Transferred 3.3 mL of culture containing 3M cells to 1 x 15 mL tube
  3. Centrifuged at 500 x g for 5 minutes
  4. Aspirated 100% of supernatant
  5. Re-suspended in 6 mL of sterile dPBS (want 10,000 cells per 200 uL (per well), so need cell suspension to have 500,000 cells per mL in enough volume to seed all wells)
  6. Set up OT2 deck with media-filled plates and cell suspension 
  7. Ran cell seeding protocol on OT2 
    1. Start time:
    2. Run time:
  8. Imaged plates on Zaber microscope (phase, 5X) and ran through ML model. Checked that wells received cells. 
  9. Moved plates to incubator at 37'C, 5%CO2 (incubator # , main/library/production lab)
