AIM/PURPOSE: To facilitate our Japanese and Bob-White quail embryonic cell
proliferation in suspension culture.

HYPOTHESIS: When cultured in e-125 shaker flasks, sustained proliferation (
for >2 weeks) of cells derived from Japanese and/or Bob-White Quail embryonic
tissue will be observed in one or more of the following culture medias.  
  
1\. OptiPro + 2mM Glutamax + 0.2% Pluronic  
2\. CDM4 Avian + 2.5mM Glutamax  
3\. Nuvonis suspension media
