### Cell Harvest

  1. Turn on water bath and set temperature to 37C.
  2. Take the flasks for harvest and observe under the microscope at 4x objective for even cell distribution . Refer to VSOP-006. Take 2-3 images per flask.
  3. Aliquot required volume of dPBS (37C), dPBS (ambient temp) and TrypLE in separate sterile pots.  Refer to Table above for required volume.
  4. Place aliquots in pre-warmed water bath and leave for ~20 minutes or until warmed. Note: Ensure TrypLE is thoroughly warmed.  
`    Time stamp` : 7:40am  

  5. Transfer aliquots and flasks required for harvest into the BSC.
  6. Discard growth media from each flask.
  7. Wash with warmed dPBS, then discard.
  8. Add TrypLE to each of the flasks. Mix thoroughly to ensure coverage of the surface area.
  9. Place in the incubator at 37C. After 10 minutes, remove flasks and observe for 95-100% dissociation of cells. Incubate further until maximum dissociation level is reached.  
     NOTE: The flasks must be removed from the incubator within 15 minutes of initial incubation of TrypLE containing flasks.  
`     Time stamps`:

    1.  Flasks 1-3 = 10:48 am - 11:06 am, Actual = 11:13 am
    2.  Flasks 4-6 = 10:52 am - 11:10 am, Actual = 11:17 am
    3.  Flasks 7-9 = 10:57 am - 11:15 am, Actual = 11:23 am
    4.  Flasks 10-12 = 11:02 am - 11:20 am, Actual = 11:26 am
    5.  Flasks 13-15 = 11:07 - 11:25 am, Actual = 11:29 am
    6. Flasks 16-19 = 11:11 am - 11:29 am, Actual = 11:37 am
  10. Aspirate the TrypLE solution and collect into 225 mL centrifuge tubes (labelled).
  11. Using a serological pipette, dispense ambient temperature dPBS to create a final wash for each of the flasks. To effectively remove remaining cells adhered to the gelatin coated flasks,  aspirate the dPBS and resuspend into the the flask 2-3 times before collecting and combining the entire volume into the centrifuge tubes.
  12. Centrifuge at 700 x g for 5 minutes. ``  
`      Time stamp`:

    1. Centrifugation # 1 start: 11:50 am
    2.  Final centrifugation start = 12:59 pm  

  13. Gently remove centrifuge tubes from the machine, ensuring not to disturb the suspended pellets. Aspirate the supernatant from the tubes. Discard supernatant. Remove as much remaining supernatant with a 1mL pipette.  
Cells are now harvested.  

###  

### Cell Count - N/A on this harvest due to the sheet/aggregated nature of the
cells harvested from each flask.  

  1.  ~~Following cell harvest and centrifugation, re-suspend the cell pellets. Use the table below to provide a rough estimation of the resuspension volume required.

### Storage

  1. Store the re-suspension media in the 2-8C fridge until ready to proceed to the next step. 

### Re-pellet and Weigh Final Yield

  1.  Label and Record the weight of 1 sterile centrifuge tube and set aside. Record details in Table.  
  2.  Transfer resuspension media into the new centrifuge tubes.
  3. Centrifuge at 700 x g x 5 minutes. 
    1. Start time of centrifugation: 14:30pm
  4. Aspirate the supernatant from the tubes, leaving approximately 5mL of resuspension media.
  5. Re-suspend the cell pellet in the tube and combine into the weighed tube.
  6. Centrifuge at 700 x g x 5 minutes. 
    1. Start time of centrifugation: 14:45pm
  7. Aspirate the supernatant from the tubes. Remove as much remaining supernatant with a 1mL pipette.
  8. Record the final weight of the cell pellet. Enter details in Table. 
  9. Immediately provide to the food team for testing.
