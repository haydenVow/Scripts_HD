Procedure


PASSAGING OF NUCLEOFECTED CELLS

1\. Took 2 x images of each vessel with microscope on phase setting (4X to
assess confluence)

2\. Aliquoted the required volume of each reagent below, placed all aliquots
to warm in the bead bath for a minimum of 20 minutes prior to use:

  1. TrypLE:  2mL per well 
  2.  dPBS (for neutralising & washing):  4mL per well 

3\. Time that all aliquots were placed in the water bath the warm before use

Note: if aliquots were placed in water bath at different time, record the time
stamp for each individual solution.

Suspension cultures and adherent cultures were set up prior to 13pm by NH and
EC. Passage started at 10:44am. Cultures harvested for FACS sorting were
passaged after lunch by  starting at 13:30

  * [EC] ZIC1, ZIC1 + CDKN1A (suspension and adherent culture setup)  

  * [NH] ZIC1 + DHRS3, CDKN1A + CDKN1B + Control (suspension and adherent culture setup)   

The following passaging protocol was followed for each knockout/control group,
The supernatants from all wells was also collected at all steps prior to
centrifugation following neutralization of tryple. All conditions were kept in
separate tubes.

* * *

4\.  Collected culture supernatant and washed each well GENTLY with 1mL of
dPBS (warmed).  

5\. Collected dPBS wash with previous supernatant and added   2  mL tryple to
each well, cells were then incubated at 37˚C for 8 minutes.  

6\. Collected supernatants into 50mL tubes alongside previous supernatants and
empty wells were washed with 1.5 ml  of dPBS. dPBS washes were then also
collected.  

7\. Centrifuged collections at 400 x g for 5 min.  

8\. Aspirated and discarded the supernatant(s) from cell pellets.

9\. Using dPBS, Resuspended and combined pellets into one tube, taking care to
rinse out tubes with a small aliquot of dPBS. Total volumes of cell suspension
at this step for each cell pellet was 2mL.

10\. Aliquoted 10uL of cell suspension for counting using a hemocytometer,
mixing 1:5 with Trypan blue. *This step was not followed during FACS prep of
culture X , Cells were moved straight to FACS prep protocol after dPBS
resuspension.

11\. Cell suspensions were counted and total cell number was determined for
each group in the document below.

ZIC1: 1,800,000 cells/mL  

ZIC1 + DHRS3: 3,096,000 cells/mL

ZIC1 + CDKN1A: 5,140,000  cells/mL

CDKN1A + CDKN1B: 5,080,000 cells/ml

Control: 2,480,000 cells/mL

7000 cells/cm^2 for each condition (5.25x10^5 cells).  
13\. Estimated volume of cell suspension needed to take for DNA extraction and
subsequent PCR (3x10^4 cells).

14\. Aliquoted the volumes of cell suspension listed above into individual
1.5mL tubes




SETTING UP ADHERENT POOLED CULTURES

  1. 1.5mL tubes containing cells for adherent culture were centrifuged for 5 min at 300g.
  2. Supernatant was removed and each pellet was resuspended in 1mL of DMEM/F12 + 20% FBS + 1xP/S growth media. 
  3. Each cell suspension was then transferred to a separate T75 flask containing 12mL of the same growth media. 
  4. Flasks were left to incubate at 30 degrees, 5% CO2 (incubator #140 ) static. 

  




SETTING UP SUSPENSION POOLED CULTURES

  1. Once aliquots for adherent cultures and DNA extraction had been taken from the cell suspension, the remaining cells were centrifuged for 5 minutes at 400g. 
  2. Supernatant was removed from each tube and replaced with 5mL of Hycell Cho basal media + KSR + FGF-b + IGF1-LR3
  3. Cells from each condition were then resuspended and transferred to separate 50mL bioreactor tubes. 
  4. Tubes were placed in incubator 120 (main lab), at 30 degrees C, 5% CO2, shaking at 210 rpm

  




FACS SORTING SUSPENSION CELLS

  1. The collected cell suspension for each condition was transferred to a 1.5mL tube and centrifuged at 300g for 5 minutes. 
  2. Supernatant was removed. 
  3. Cells were resuspended in 500uL of FACS buffer 
  4. An esky box was packed for transport to the FACS facility 
    1. Pre-filled (medium) multi-well plates (8x96wp), parafilmed around the edges
    2. An ice pack
    3. Extra FACS Buffer prepared earlier. 
    4. 4x 0.22um filter capped tubes. 
  5. Once at the FACS facility: 
    1. Samples were passed though 0.22um filter lids into sample collection tubes
    2. A live dead stain was added to each of the sample tubes, 5uL of 7-AAD stain (invitrogen) 
    3. Cells from each condition were sorted into 2 x 96 well plates each containing adherent growth media, 1 cell per well (see FACS preparation for media compositions). 
  6. Plates were transported back to Vow and moved directly to the incubator at 30 degrees, 5% CO2 (Incubator number #140, library lab ) (17:38) 




FREEZING PELLETS FOR DNA EXTRACTION

  1. Added an additional 1mL of dPBS to each aliquot of cells taken for DNA extraction. 
  2. Centrifuged tubes at 300g for 5 minutes to pellet cells. 
  3. Removed supernatant from each tube then added all tubes to a yellow lid pot labelled with the epic number and date. 
  4. Stored cell pellets at −20°C in the bottom shelf of the freezer in library lab. 

  

  




## Observations

Cell counts for cells in both CDKN1A groups were much higher than the other
groups and control.




## Reference Images.

No images were taken of the plates prior to passage since the imaging system
was down, the top 3 wells of all plates were inspected under the microscope.
No abnormal morphology was seen. All wells were 95-100% confluent at the time
of passage.
