## Performed by: Shaleen Sharma  




Differentiation Media:

For plate testing gelatin as a coating:

  * [X]  E6 (all wells)

For plate testing gelatin as an ingredient:

  * [X]  E6 + 0 mg/mL Gelatin 
  * [X]  E6 + 1 mg/mL Gelatin
  * [X]  E6 + 5 mg/mL Gelatin
  * [X]  E6 + 10 mg/mL Gelatin
  * [X]  E6 + 20 mg/mL Gelatin

Total media required: 150uL per well,

Only 2.4mL is required for E6 + Gelatin conditions (16 wells per condition)
however a large excess has been aliquotted (5.5mL) as a comfortable excess and
in case of spillage, mistakes etc.

Process:

1\. Placed pre-aliquotted    1 x 15mL (E6) 5 x 5.5mL (E6 + Gelatin)  mL of  E6
Media and E6 + Gelatin (X mg/mL) Media into incubator   14:30 a/pm

2\. Imaged the topmost wells of each plate (excluding PBS wells on the edges)
under 5X or 4X magnification and linked MIA capture link below.

2\. Aspirated   150uL of media from each well.

3\. Replaced with  150uL  (per well/per vessel) of  Differentiation  media.

4\. Returned vessel to incubate at:   15:16 a/pm , incubator #   Thermo

  * [X]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (aviary cells)
