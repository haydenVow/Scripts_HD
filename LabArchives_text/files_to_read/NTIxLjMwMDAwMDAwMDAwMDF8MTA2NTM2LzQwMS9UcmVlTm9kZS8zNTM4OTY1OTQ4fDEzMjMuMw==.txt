Aggregation/Peeling Observations:

(1) Fibroblast Control(2) Fibroblast- Seeded with TGFb  
  
  * 11/09/21 - The first signs of peeling were visible on day 12 (5 days after VitC treatment). This was only a very small section of mild peeling at the base of the flask (Circled in red in picture below)
  * 12/09/21 and 13/09/21 - On day 13 and day 14 this peeling looked the same as day 12 so it was decided not to harvest and perform a 50% feed on day 14
  * 14/09/21 - On day 15 (8 days since initial VitC treatment) complete peeling had occurred and the bottle was harvested

  * 17/09/21 - The first signs of peeling were observed in this flask. This peeling was complete and had rolled up to the top of the bottle (See imaged below)
  * This bottle was harvested on this day (18 proliferation days, 7 days in TGFb treatment and 11 days in VitC treatment) 

  
  
(3) MUSC Control(4&5) MUSC + Fibroblast - 1:1, 1,650  
  
  * 17/09/21 - This bottle displayed the first signs of peeling on this day. The peeling was different to the fibroblast only bottles and as it was not in one uniform sheet, but it did look to be rolling up the bottle in a similar way. The aggregates also looked thinner/weaker than the aggregation in fibroblast only bottles. This texture looked much more similar to that of MUSC + FIBRO bottle aggregates. 
  * The bottle was harvested on this day (18 proliferation days, 2 days of TGFb + VitC treatment)

  * On day 7 bottle 5 was treated with VitC and on day 8 TGFb was also added

  * Bottle 4 was not treated at any point and used as a control

  * On day 14 complete peeling occurred in Bottle 5 and both bottles were harvested (No peeling had occurred in bottle 4)

  
  
(6) MUSC 1,650 + Fibroblast 7,500(7) MUSC \+ Fibroblast - 1:1, 7,500  
  
  

  * On day 9, 2 days after treatment with VitC 50ug/mL (1 day after TGFb 10ng/mL) peeling occurred and the bottle was harvested:

  * On day 8, 1 day after treatment with VitC 50ug/ml (No TGFb was added because peeling had already begun), peeling began:

  * On day 9, 2 days after VitC treatment, peeling had progressed and the bottle was harvested:
