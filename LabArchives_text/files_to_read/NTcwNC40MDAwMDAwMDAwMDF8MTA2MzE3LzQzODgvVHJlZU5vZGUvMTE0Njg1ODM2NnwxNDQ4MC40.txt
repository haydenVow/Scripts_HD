### Process:  

3\. Aliquoted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then
placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath for a minimum of 20 minutes
prior to use:

  1. TrypLE:     25   mL in     1 x 15mL Falcon Tube  tub
  2.  dPBS (for washing and neutralising):    25mL    mL 
  3. dPBS (for neutralising):    25mL    mL
  4. Growth media (for pellet resuspension):    10 mL 
  5. Growth media (for seeding):  500mL.

Time that all aliquots were placed in the water bath the warm before use
14:20  

Note: if aliquots were placed in water bath at different time, record the time
stamp for each individual solution.




4\. Removed vessel(s) from the incubator

5\. Washed the vessel(s) with dPBS (warmed).

6\. Added    10   mL tryple (T175s) to each vessel/well and incubated at 37˚C.
Added    5   mL tryple (T75s) to each vessel/well and incubated at 37˚C.

  1. Start/Finish for TrypLE was   14:48-14:58  

7\. Neutralised with    10/5mL   dPBS and combined cell suspension.

8\. Centrifuged at 650 x g for 5 min.

  1. Start/Finish time for centrifugation was   15:05-15:10  




9\. Aspirated the supernatant(s).

10\. Resuspended pellet(s) in    10  mL       growth   media

11\. Aliquoted   50ul     of resuspended cells into a microcentrifuge tube for
cell count.

12\. Performed a cell count using the haemocytometer and recorded the cell
count data in the Google Doc spreadsheet called 'Cell Count Spreadsheet' (see
link below):

SSIBtIylyrBQE5kRX5Z8NtI/edit#gid=0

  1. Total cell number was:   13,824,000
  2. Cell density per vessel:    8,700    

13\. Added cell suspension into 300mL of growth media.

14\. Seeded into 9x T175s

15\. Placed in incubator at Library #68 15:40
