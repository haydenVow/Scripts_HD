Process:

  1.  ~~Aliquotted 2x 375 mL of respective growth medias above  
~~

  2.  ~~Placed in water bath  15:20~~
  3.  ~~Removed  50  % of supernatant from vessel. ~~
  4.  ~~Replaced with  375mL  per vessel  of  Growth   media. ~~
  5.  ~~Returned vessel to incubate at:  ~~ ~~ ~~16:10~~~~
  6. Removed from incubator: 15:50
    1. Pour supernatant into a sterile 1L bottle
    2. Let the peeled cells settle to the bottom of the flask and aspirate the supernatant
    3. pour the remaining cells and media into 2x 250mL centrifuge tube.
    4. tryple: 16:30 -16:45
    5. Centrifuge the pellet at 650g for 5min (room temp) 16:50 - 18:05
    6. Move cells and remaining supernatant into a 50mL falcon tube and centrifuge for 1 minute at 650g 16:55 - 16:56
    7. weigh the cells 
      1. weight of 250mL tube alone:  
1) 38.6949

      2. tube + cells: 55.7183
      3. Final weight of the cell pellet: 17.0234g  

    8. place in a -20 C Freezer  18:20
