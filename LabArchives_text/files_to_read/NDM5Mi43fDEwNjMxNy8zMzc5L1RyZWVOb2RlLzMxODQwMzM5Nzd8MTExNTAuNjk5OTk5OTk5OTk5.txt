Process:

  1. Prepared for biopsy:

    1. Surgical drapes

    2. Iodine spray/solution
    3. 70% ethanol bottle

    4. Lab coats

    5. Gloves

    6. Sterile guaze - 6 packs

    7. Sterile forceps - 4/biopsy

    8. Sterile scalpels - 4/biopsy
    9. Sterile scissors - 4/biopsy
    10. Hair clippers - 1 set
    11. Esky with ice packs (if biopsy is being transported to Vow)
    12. Rediwipes 
    13. Permanent markers
    14. 50mL tubes stored in the fridge until use:
      1. (PRF?) DMEM/F12 + 1% v/v P/S if the biopsy will be collected at Vow. Add 10% FBS if the biopsy will need to be transported in tubes.

        1. 1/biopsy + 2 spares. Numbered the tubes.

      2. PBS + 1% v/v P/S

        1. 1/biopsy + 2 spares. Numbered the tubes.

  2. Details of animal biopsy harvest & transportation:

  3. Biopsies collected at: 

  4. Sprayed the surface of the leg with 70% ethanol, gently dab with sterile gauze.
  5. Poured iodine solution into sterile gauze and dabbed it over the surface of the leg. Left this on for 5 min 

    1. Left hind leg: 1:25pm - 1:30pm

    2. right hind leg: 1:49 pm - 1:54pm

    3.  left front leg: 14:13 - 14:18

    4. right front leg: 14:16 - 14:21

  6. Gently dabbed away excess with sterile gauze

  7. Process for collecting muscle biopsies:
  8.   

    1. `First cut a square (not too deep) to remove the skin`

    2. Changed scalpels and tweezers (as the outer layer may be contaminated). Cut another square into the tissue (not too deep). Removed this - It will not be used as it may be contaminated.

    3. Changed scalpels and tweezers and take biopsies (approx 3x2x2cm).

  9. Process for collecting dermal biopsies:

    1. Using scalpels and tweezers, pull and cut away the thin outer white layer from the surface of the sample

  10. Placed each biopsy in a tube containing DMEM/F12 + 1x P/S. Once all biopsies have been taken. Transferred biopsies to tubes containing PBS + 1x P/S. 

  11. Then transfer tubes containing biopsies to the lab. 

Samples 1 and 3 were transferred into the library lab at 14:38pm.  

Samples 2 and 4-7 were transferred into the library lab at 14:52pm.

PROCESS FOR BIOPSIES TO BE STORED:

Proteomic and Genomic samples

\- NOTE 1: If using posiclick tubes (ie. with click lids) PLEASE punch a small
hole in the top of the lid, this will prevent the tube from exploding when it
is removed from the -80C freezer.

\- NOTE 2: If possible, please use certified DNase/RNase free tubes for the
genomic samples

  
Method: 1-2g muscle samples should be carefully placed inside a small 1.7ml
posiclick tube (or cryo-vial) and then immediately immersed in liquid
nitrogen. Samples should be allowed to freeze and equilibrate for at least 2
minutes (17:02 - 17:06) before transferring to the -80C freezer (17:07)

Histology samples

\- NOTE 1: Before starting, remove the plunger from a 5-10ml syringe and trim
either side of the top circular piece (opposite end of the rubber plunger).
This should leave you with a rectangular strip of plastic 3-5mm in width and
1-2cm in length

\- NOTE 2: For this preparation you will need a small plastic urine jar with
~30-50ml of isopropanol and a container of liquid nitrogen (a small esky works
well).

Method:

  1. Make up some 0.1% PFA in PBS in a 50mL urine pot and leave at 4 degrees. 
  2. Trim off a small piece of biopsy, ideally this should be rectangular in shape with the long side running with the grain of the muscle (so, muscle fibres should run down the long side). The piece should be no more than 10mm X 5mm X 5mm (at most, it needs to be small enough to fit on the end of a syringe) 
  3. Place the piece of muscle into ice-cold 0.1% PFA and put into the refrigerator for 60mins. 
    1. Note: Biopsy numbers #2, #4 and #5 were placed in the 0.1% PFA and transferred into the 4C fridge at 16:22 pm.
  4. Wash the muscle piece 3x5min in PBS  
17:32 - 17:37  
17:39 - 17:46  
17:48 - 17:53  
  

  5. Transfer liquid nitrogen from the transport dewer to a styrofoam esky to a depth of ~3cm
  6. Fill a urine container with 20-30mL of isopropanol.
  7. Punch a hole in the lid of all 1.5mL tubes required to store samples using a pair of sterile scissors.
  8. Place the isopropanol container into the liquid nitrogen (do not allow liquid nitrogen to spill and mix with isopropanol).
  9. Once the isopropanol begins to visually freeze (it should visually turn white) proceed with O.C.T mounting.
  10. Place a biopsy piece placed onto the face of the trimmed plunger and cover with O.C.T mounting medium.
  11. When 10% of isopropanol has frozen dip the biopsy piece into the isopropanol for 5 seconds.
  12. Use forceps to transfer the frozen sample in OCT to one of the 1.5mL tubes and place immediately into liquid nitrogen surrounding the urine container.
