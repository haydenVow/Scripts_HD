While it is hard to be prescriptive with what a report should contain, there
are a few common points that all reports should consider. A report should
(almost) replicate the "Discussion" section of a journal article. The
following is a ROUGH guide with a suggested paragraph structure. PLEASE ensure
to include references to previously published work (or links to work conducted
here at Vow).

  1. What is the most important overarching finding? 
  2. A brief discussion of all results and how they fit into our final goal of producing an edible meat product (this section might be several paragraphs long and should put the results into the context of what has been done before). 
  3. Any limitations of the study, why might our results not be correct? 
  4. What is the overall conclusion? 
  5. Discussion of future directions.

***PLEASE NOTE, YOUR REPORT SHOULD BE FINALISED WITHIN TWO WEEKS OF COMPLETING
ALL EXPERIMENTAL WORK.***  

  


Brief background


Several problems with the cryobank arose in May 2021:

  1. Cryovials not physically stored in the location listed in Stockyard
  2. It is not obvious where there are free locations in the dewars to store new vials
  3. The boxes are not stored in towers in order to minimize the freeze-thaw cycles of raw isolates and MCB vials
  4. The label generation for large numbers of cryovials from a single event is very laborious

Tom Tarento, Soroush Pour, Kylie Kong and Michael Medynskyj discussed part of
the problem related to Stockyard only: https://www.notion.so/vow/Suggested-
