Took samples

  1. Stopped the shaker
  2. Removed flasks from incubator
  3. Gently shook flasks to resuspend microcarriers
  4. Aspirated 1 mL sample from each flask and transferred to a corresponding 1.5 mL Eppendorf tube
  5. Returned flasks to the incubator
  6. Restarted the shaker

Stained and imaged cells adhered to microcarriers

  1. Added 1 drop of Hoechst 33342 ReadyProbes reagent to each 1 mL sample
  2. Mixed each tube by hand for 3 seconds
  3. Left the tubes lying their sides in a dark place at room temperature for 10 - 20 minutes.  `| 16:23 - 16:43  |`
  4. Mixed each tube by hand for 3 seconds
  5. Transferred 20 uL of the even suspension to a well in a 96 well plate
  6. Added 80 uL of PBS to make the volume up to 100 uL
  7. Inspected the wells under the Axio microscope, 5x objective.
  8. If the microcarriers overlapped then further diluted the samples
  9. Using https://mia-capture.vow.tools/#/, took 3 sets of same frame images using the DAPI and PHASE channels for each well `| 13:14 (27/07/21)  |`
  10. Once images were captured, Image pairs were assigned a 'location ID' in MIA capture. 
  11. Images captured were then selected for analysis using the 'uCarrier cell count plastic' tool from MIA capture. 

  




Nuclear Ejection

  1. Removed 0.85 mL of the supernatant from the 1.5mL tubes carefully without aspirating the microcarriers.

  2. Washed microcarriers using 0.85 mL of room temperature Dulbecco's phosphate buffered saline without Ca2+ and Mg2+ (DPBS-/-).
  3. Aspirated and discarded the dPBS wash.
  4. Added 0.85 mL of cell lysis solution to the microcarriers
  5. Vortexed the 1.5 mL tube for 1 min at maximum speed to release nuclei.
  6. Loaded 10uL of each Hoechst stained sample onto a countess slide and took four images of separate locations under the DAPI imaging channel on the Axio under the 5x objective.
  7. Culture 7343 Calculated the cells/mL by converting the cells/mm2value shown in MIA capture
    1. Average cell count = average(5.39, 6.10, 4.30, 6.47) = 5.57 cells/mm2
    2. Average cell count = 5.57 x 10,000 =  55,700 cells/mL
    3. Total cell count =  55,700  x 500 =  27,850,000  million cells
  8. Culture 7344 Calculated the cells/mL by converting the cells/mm2value shown in MIA capture
    1. Average cell count = average(7.18, 9.57, 10.40, 9.80) =  9.24 cells/mm2
    2. Average cell count =   9.24 x 10,000 = 92,400  cells/mL
    3. Total cell count =  92,400  x 500  = 46,200,000  million cells
