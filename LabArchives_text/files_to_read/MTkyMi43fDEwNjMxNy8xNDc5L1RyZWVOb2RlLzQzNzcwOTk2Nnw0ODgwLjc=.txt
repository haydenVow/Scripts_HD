Growth Media (for resuspension):

  * [ x]  DMEM + 20% FBS + 1x P/S + P38i




Process:

 1\. Aliquotted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and
then placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath for a minimum of 20 minutes
prior to use:

  1.  TrypLE:  500mL in 2x urine jars. 
  2.  dPBS (for neutralising)   500 \+ 500 for washing.
  3.  Growth media (for pellet resuspension):    50mL in 1 urine jar 
  4.  Time that all aliquots were placed in the water bath to warm before use:   15:22-15:40

Note: if aliquots were placed in water bath at different times, record the
time stamp for each individual solution.




2\. Washed the flask(s) with dPBS.

3\. Added 500mL PBS to the 10CF to 10CF to wash.

4\. Removed PBS and added 500mL tryple to the 10CF and incubated at 37ºC for
10 min

5\. Neutralised with 100mL dPBS (warmed) and combined cell suspension into a
50ml tube.

6\. Centrifuged at 650 x g for 5 min. Start/Finish time for centrifugation
was:   16:00,16:10,16:25  




6\. Aspirated the supernatant(s).

7\. Resuspend pellet(s) in 49.5mL media.

8\. Performed a cell count using the haemocytometer and recorded the cell
count data in the Google Doc spreadsheet called 'Cell Count Spreadsheet' (see
link below):

SSIBtIylyrBQE5kRX5Z8NtI/edit#gid=0

9\. Total cell number was: 58 million

10\. Discarded 19.069mL of cell suspension, in order to bank 30M




11\. Prepared   30mL Freeze Medium: (Cryostor).

Stored at 4ºC until use to keep chilled.

12\. Centrifuged cells at 650 x g for 5 min.  17:14

Whilst centrifuge is spinning, prepared & printed vial labels, labelled
cryovials. (Note that passage number will be the same as the culture you
harvest from. The passage number will increase by 1 during the revive of a
vial.)




13\. Aspirated supernatant carefully, taking care not to disturb the pellet.

14\. Resuspended the pellet in 30mL freeze media Cryostor

15\. Aliquotted 500µL into 60 x cryovials (already labelled). -Some had to be
discarded due to spilliage. Now only 51.

16\. Tightened the lids & transfer the cryovials to 2x Mr. Frosty immediately
into the -80ºC freezer.  17:50

  * 1 Mr Frosty with sponge - 1st freeze
  * 1 Mr Frosty without sponge - 1st freeze
  * 1 Mr Frosty without sponge - 3rd freeze

17\. Allow the cells to freeze for at least 18-24 hours before transferring to
Liquid Nitrogen storage.
