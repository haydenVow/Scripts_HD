Process:

Aliquoted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then
placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath > 30 minutes prior to use

SILKIEK

  1. Observed cultures under the microscope and recorded confluence in the table above. 
  2. Imaged cultures on 10x magnification (captured in Mia)
  3. TrypLE:   40  mL 
  4. dPBS (for washing & neutralising)   80  mL
  5. Growth media (for pellet resuspension and seeding):    5 mL 
  6. Washed the flask(s) with dPBS.
  7. Added   10  tryple to each vessel/well and incubated at 37˚C for   22 min (16:06 - 16:28) cells have been round for a while but still quite sticky so removed tryple and performed extra washes. Checked flask after tryplisation and still a fair few cells left behind.   
  8. Neutralised with   10  dPBS (warmed) and combined cell suspension into   2 x 50 mL  tubes.
  9. Centrifuged at 500 x g for 5 min.
  10. Aspirated + discarded supernatant
  11. Resuspended pellet(s) in   5  mL media.  
Performed a cell count using the hemocytometer and recorded the cell count
data in widget or the Google Doc spreadsheet called 'Cell Count Spreadsheet'
(see link below):

  12. Total cell number was:  
 4,537,778  note: there were a couple of sizable clumps of cells which could
not be broken up through pipetting and so this would have contributed to the
low cell count.

  13. Re-seeded cells as per table above.

  14. Transferred flasks to incubate at 37ºC, 5% CO2, library lab incubator #77




Process:

Aliquoted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then
placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath > 30 minutes prior to use

KINGO  
Observed cultures under the microscope and recorded confluence in the table
above.

  1. Imaged cultures on 5x magnification (captured in Mia)
  2. TrypLE:   5  mL 
  3. dPBS (for washing & neutralising)   10  mL
  4. Growth media (for pellet resuspension and seeding):    5 mL 
  5. Washed the flask(s) with dPBS.
  6. Added   10  tryple to each vessel/well and incubated at 37˚C for   12 min   
  7. Neutralised with   5  dPBS (warmed) and combined cell suspension into  1 x 15 mL  tubes.
  8. Centrifuged at 500 x g for 5 min.
  9. Aspirated + discarded supernatant
  10. Resuspended pellet(s) in   2  mL media.  
Performed a cell count using the hemocytometer and recorded the cell count

HORNO2

Observed cultures under the microscope and recorded confluence in the table

  1. Imaged cultures on 10x magnification (captured in Mia)
  2. TrypLE:   20  mL 
  3. dPBS (for washing & neutralising)   40  mL
  4. Growth media (for pellet resuspension and seeding):    10 mL (resuspension), 120mL Seeding 
  5. Washed the flask(s) with dPBS.
  6. Added   10  tryple to each vessel/well and incubated at 37˚C for   
  7. Neutralised with   10  dPBS (warmed) and combined cell suspension into   1 x 50 mL  tubes.
  8. Centrifuged at 500 x g for 5 min.
  9. Aspirated + discarded supernatant

  11. Total cell number was:  
 4,600,000 cells.

  12. Re-seeded cells as per table above (4xT175 flasks)

  13. Transferred flasks to incubate at 37ºC, 5% CO2, library lab incubator #77  
No culture labels were added to these flasks, They were left with the media,
date of seeding, cell line and passage number written on the flask (Passage 2)
