Process:

  1. Aliquoted:
    1. 5 mL of D/F + 10% FBS + 1xP/S 
      1. Placed in water bath. Timestamp:  14:23   

  2. Paused shaker by pressing the "play" button on the controller on the side wall of the incubator
  3. Collected culture vessel from shaker, wiped with ethanol-sprayed cloth and brought into BSC
  4. Using a 5 mL serelogical pipette, gently pipette-mixed culture for 1 minute to break up cell clumps
  5. Pipetted suspension though 70 um cell strainer into 1 x 50 mL tube
  6. Took 1 x 500 uL sample from 5 mL cell suspension and followed procedure in entry below to count cells.
  7. Centrifuged at 300 x g for 5 min. Timestamp: 15:12 - 15:17
  8. Aspirated 5 mL of supernatant, taking care to not disrupt or aspirate pellet 
  9. Re-suspended cultures using serelogical.
  10. Replaced with 5 mL of fresh, warmed media
  11. Gently pipette-mixed cultures again before moving back to spin tubes 
  12. Returned vessel to incubator and replaced in clamp. Timestamp: 
  13. Incubator (#68), Lab [Main/Library/Production]




Stain and image:

  1. Took 100 uL samples of each culture, transferred to wells in 96 well plate
  2. Prepared stain buffer of equal volumes of NucBlue and NucGreen reagents (M6457)
  3. Added 10 uL of stain buffer to each well, pipet mixed each well
  4. Incubated at room temperature in the dark for 10-20 minutes 15:43 - 15:55
  5. Centrifuged at 650 RCF for 1 minutes   

  6. Took images of each well on the blue and green fluorescence channels using the Zaber on culture 7502 EPIC21187-EPIC22603, below correspond to wells in row A:
    1. Culture ID 7342
    2. Culture ID 7415
    3. Culture ID 7665
    4. Culture ID 7666
    5. Culture ID 7667
    6. Culture ID 7668
    7. Culture ID 7669
    8. Culture ID 7670
  7. Took 100 uL samples of each E125 culture, transferred to wells in 96 well plate
  8. Added 10 uL of stain buffer to each well, pipet mixed each well
  9. Incubated at room temperature in the dark for 10-20 minutes 17:11 - 17:21
  10. Centrifuged at 650 RCF for 1 minute
    1. Took images of each well on the blue and green fluorescence channels using the Zaber on culture 7502 EPIC21187-EPIC22603, listed below:
    2. Culture ID 7690 (E1)
    3. Culture ID 7692 (E2)
    4. Culture ID 7698 (E3)
    5. Culture ID 7699 (E4)
    6. Culture ID 7697 (E5)
    7. Culture ID 7695 (E6)
    8. Culture ID 7696 (E7)
    9. Culture ID 7693 (E8)
    10. Culture ID 7691 (E9)
    11. Culture ID 7689 (E10)
    12. Culture ID 7694 (H1)
    13. Culture ID 7700 (H2)
    14. Culture ID 7466 (H3)
    15. Culture ID 7465 (H4)
    16. Culture ID 7673 (H5)
