Procedure




Entered the manual haemocytometer counts into the widget above for each flask.
Since the flasks were of different volumes (1 x E125 and 1 x E500), the 'Count
Averages' are NOT representative of the actual averages.

The seeding density of the E5000 was calculated by doing the following:  
141.5 mL x 864k (E500) + 25 mL x 764k (E125) / 2166.5 mL (total volume of
E5000) = ~65.2k cells / mL
