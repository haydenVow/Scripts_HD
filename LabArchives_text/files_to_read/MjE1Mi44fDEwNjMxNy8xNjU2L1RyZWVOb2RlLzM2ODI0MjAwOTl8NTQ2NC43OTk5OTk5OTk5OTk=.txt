Aim/Purpose


To test an animal-component free medium for long-term culture of primary
muscle stem cells which consists of E8 media + albumin. To test a new
passaging protocol using this medium which involves the delayed addition of
albumin after passaging.


Hypothesis


The use of B8 + albumin, as well as the delayed addition of albumin after
passaging will result in better doubling times than our existing ACF media
(E810C).


Technical Gap


We have not tested  the use of 'Beefy-9' media for culturing our cells.
Additionally, we have not tried testing the use of a vitronectin coating for
vessels when culturing cells in ACF media.


Method/Procedure


08-June-2021

  1. Gelatin coat 6x T25 flasks.
  2. Thaw DOLLY12 into serum containing media (DMEM/F12 + 20% FBS + 1x P/S + 10uM p38i)
  3. Seed 1 flask at a density of 2500 cells/cm^2 and seed the remaining flasks at 1000 cells/cm^2. 

09-June-2021:

  1. Wash flasks with PBS.
  2. Perform a 100% feed with different media conditions:
    1. condition 1: 1000 cells/cm^2, serum containing media
    2. condition 2: 1000 cells/cm^2, E810C (will be used as gelatin control later)
    3. condition 3: 1000 cells/cm^2, E810C
    4. condition 4: 1000 cells/cm^2, Beefy-9
    5. condition 5: 2500 cells/cm^2, Beefy-9
    6. condition 6: 1000 cells/cm^2, Beefy-10C

11-June-2021:

  1. Gelatin coat 2x T25 flasks. Coat 4x T25 flasks with vitronectin (1.5ug/cm^2)
  2. Passage cells following standard practices (using Tryple)
  3. Perform cell counts for all conditions. Record in this spreadsheet to calculate doublings: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/19Foy6WldT2AJsA3H5ZR9gXnKBxG-E4D2RnTgPx-MWgE/edit#gid=539719673
  4. Seed conditions as follows:
    1. cells from condition 1: gelatin coated flask (1000 cells/cm^2) in serum media
    2. cells from condition 2: gelatin coated flask (1000 cells/cm^2) in E810C media
    3. cells from condition 3: vitronectin coated flask (1000 cells/cm^2) in E810C media
    4. cells from condition 4: vitronectin coated flask (1000 cells/cm^2) in B8 media
    5. cells from condition 5: vitronectin coated flask (2500 cells/cm^2) in B8 media
    6. cells from condition 6: vitronectin coated flask (1000 cells/cm^2) in B8+10C media

12-June-2021:

  1. Add 800ug/mL of albumin into the flasks for conditions 4,5 and 6.

13-June-2021

  1. Perform a 100% feed of all cultures.

14-June-2021 and onwards

  1. Maintain cells in culture by passaging as described under 11-June when cells get to 50-70% confluent. Perform a 100% feed every 48 hours. 
  2. Monitor cell doublings so that when cells are close to 10 doublings, expand them into at least 1x T75 flask per condition.
  3. Seed cells into 96 well plate/s (7000 cells/well) to perform a differentiation assay. Seed some back into T25 flask for continuous culture.
    1. Replicates as follows (this may change depending on cell numbers):
      1.  2x 96 wp with 10 wells from each condition in each plate.
  4. When cells in 96 wp reach 100% confluence, feed with differentiation media:
    1. 5x replicates per condition per plate with Neurobasal/L15+IGF1+EGF
    2. 5x replicates per condition per plate with E6 (x0.2 P/S)
  5. After 4 days in differentiation, fix 1x 96 wp.
  6. After 7 days in differentiation, fix 1x 96 wp.
  7. Stain both plates for MyoG and MF20.
  8. Image on the Zaber.
  9. Analyse % MyoG positive cells and MF20 area.
