Process:

1\. Aliquotted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then
placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath for a minimum of 20 minutes
prior to use:

  1. TrypLE:    40   mL in  1 x 120 ml     tubes
  2. dPBS (for neutralising)   40   mL in  1 x 120 ml   tubes
  3. dPBS (for pellet resuspension):   40   mL in    1 x 120 ml    tubes




2\. Washed the flask(s) with dPBS.

3\. Added   10    mL tryple to each vessel/well and incubated at 37ËšC for   8
min.

4\. Neutralised with   10    dPBS (warmed) and combined cell suspension into
2 x 50 ml   tube.

5\. Centrifuged at 400 x g for 5 min




6\. Aspirated the supernatant(s)

7\. Resuspended pellet(s) in     20   mL    dPBS  

8\. Performed a cell count using the haemocytometer and recorded the cell
count data in widget or the Google Doc spreadsheet called 'Cell Count
Spreadsheet' (see link below):

9\. Total cell number was:   6,720,000  

10\. Centrifuged and aspirated the dPBS carefully, making sure not to disturb
the cell pellet.

11\. Resuspended the cell pellet in 90 ml of pre-warmed growth media and
aliquotted 30 ml into each T175.

12\. Placed into incubator 140 in Library Lab.
