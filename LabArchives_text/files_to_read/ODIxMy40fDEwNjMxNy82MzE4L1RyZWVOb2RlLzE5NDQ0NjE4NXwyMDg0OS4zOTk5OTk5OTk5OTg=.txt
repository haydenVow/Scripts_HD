Prepare materials for thaw and seed:

  * NOTE: IF PERFORMING A THAW FROM A CLONAL MCB_2 OR WCB_2, PREPARE AT LEAST ONE EXTRA 96 WELL PLATE FOR A DIFFERENTIATION ASSAY. THIS IS AN IMPORTANT QUALITY CONTROL STEP WHILE WE BUILD OUR CLONAL CELL BANK.
  * Suggested layout for diff assay (please refer to previous diff assays for exact seeding, feeding and analysis procedures)  

  * 

1\. Aliquotted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then
placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath for a minimum of 20 minutes
prior to use:

  * Growth media (for seeding):    120 mL 
  * Growth media (for resuspending):      10 ml 
  * Time that aliquot was placed in the water bath to warm before use:   : a/pm 

  




## Thaw and seed vial:

3\. Collected the cryovial from Liquid Nitrogen storage & place in foam
floater in water bath for 5 min 15:33pm

Location where cryovial was collected from:

Vial details:  2   x  CHOMP09  cryovials at 15M cells each for a total of
30M cells

Brew

Tower/Bucket # 4

Box/Cane # 8

Vial location: F7, F8  

Vial ID(s): 13685, 13683  

`4. Ethanol sprayed & transferred the vial(s) to the BSC.`

`5.  Added 0.5ml of Growth Media (to generate a total volume of 1mL in the
cryovial) to the cryovial, resuspended the cell suspension gently to reduce
osmotic shock. `

`6. Collected the entire 1mL of cell suspension & transfer into the pre-warmed
tube of 10mL of growth media. ``  
`

`7. Centrifuged the cells at 300g for 5 minutes.  
`

`8. Resuspended cells in   8 mL of growth media `

`Cell count 29440000 cells total`

9\. `transferred 2mL to 4 T175 flasks containing 28mL of growth media
flask/well   16:14pm ```  

`9. Transfered flask/plate(s) to incubate at: 16:15`

  * [ ]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (aviary cells)
  * [X] 30ºC, 5% CO2 (aviary cells)

  

Making labels

Note - You will need to increase the passage number by one. (i.e. if your
thawed vial ID has a passage number of 3, when you make a culture ID for you
vessel you will need change the passage number to 4 on Airtable.)
