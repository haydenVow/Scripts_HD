Method:

  1. Removed cultures from the incubator.
  2. Removed 1.982mL from culture 11410-1 and 2.083mL from culture 11412-1, placed aliquots into 15mL tubes.
  3. Proceeded with protocol above as instructed.
  4. Once samples were loaded in the MELODY FACS machine, single cells were gated and PI intensity was assessed alongside event count. See images below.

Overall we weren't able to see any cells obviously in S or G2 phase.
Histograms of the single cell cell populations for both samples exhibited one
major peak. This suggests all cells are in G0/G1 phase. In the future we will
include a positive control (Trypalised cells from an adherent CHOMP
population) as well as a negative control for each sample (PI negative cells).
These controls should help us confirm this hypothesis.  
  
Right now we suspect that our cell populations at 120rpm are sitting in the
G0/G1 phase and are not proliferating.
