###  

Growth Media Ingredients:

DMEM = 197.5 mL

F12 = 197.5 mL

FBS = 100 mL

1X P/S = 5 mL

  

Will be using 90 mL of growth media to seed cells in 3 x T175s, calculate
required volume of p38i needed:

p38i = 45 uL (10 uM x 90 mL = 20 mM x _v2_ ---> v2 = 45 uL)




  
  

Prepare materials for thaw and seed:

  * NOTE: IF PERFORMING A THAW FROM A CLONAL MCB_2 OR WCB_2, PREPARE AT LEAST ONE EXTRA 96 WELL PLATE FOR A DIFFERENTIATION ASSAY. THIS IS AN IMPORTANT QUALITY CONTROL STEP WHILE WE BUILD OUR CLONAL CELL BANK.
  * Suggested layout for diff assay (please refer to previous diff assays for exact seeding, feeding and analysis procedures)  

  * 

1\. Gelatin coated   3 x   T175 flasks/plates with sterile filtered 0.1%
gelatin solution and then incubated all coated flasks at 37ºC

  * Time when all flasks placed into the incubator   1:39 pm 

2\. Aliquotted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then
placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath for a minimum of 20 minutes
prior to use:

  *  Growth media (for seeding):   90 mL 
  * Time that aliquot was placed in the water bath to warm before use:  3:00 pm 

  




## Thaw and seed vial:

3\. Collected the cryovial from Liquid Nitrogen storage & place in foam
floater in water bath for 5 min  4:30 - 4:35 pm

Location where cryovial was collected from:

Vial details:  1   x  DOLLY12  cryovials at   540K  cells each for a total of
540K  cells

Brew: Liquid Nitrogen  

Tower/Bucket: #2  

Box/Cane: #1  

Vial location: G2

Vial ID(s): 2253

`4. Ethanol sprayed & transferred the vial(s) to the BSC.`

`5.  Added 500 µL of Growth Media (to generate a total volume of 1mL in the
cryovial) to the cryovial, resuspended the cell suspension gently to reduce
osmotic shock. `

`6. Collected the entire 1mL of cell suspension & transfer into the pre-warmed
tube of Growth Media. `

`7. Using a 10mL serological pipette, resuspended & distributed the cells
evenly in the  90 mL of pre-warmed Growth Media (prepared in Step 2). `

`8. Transfered  30 mL to each pre-coated  T175  flask/well, allow to rest in
the BSC at RT for 30 min  4:50 - 5:20 pm `

`9. Transfered flask/plate(s) to incubate at: `

  * [X]  37ºC @ 5:23 pm, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (aviary cells)

  

Making labels

Note - You will need to increase the passage number by one. (i.e. if your
thawed vial ID has a passage number of 3, when you make a culture ID for you
vessel you will need change the passage number to 4 on Airtable.)

Summary:

Thawed DOLLY12 cells and seeded into 3x T175 flasks with growth media (DMEM /
F12 + 20% FBS + 1X P/S + p38i inhibitor).
