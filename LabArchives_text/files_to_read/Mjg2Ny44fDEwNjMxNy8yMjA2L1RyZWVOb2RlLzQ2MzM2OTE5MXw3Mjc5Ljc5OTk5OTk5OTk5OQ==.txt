Process:

1\. Aliquotted   1.5mL  mL of  both E6 and HS diff media into  separate 15mL
tube(s). Placed them in the water bath  9:42am  

Note: More E6 may need to be aliquoted from the main lab, There should be some
in the bar fridge below the Biostat A.

2\. Inspected the E6 treated wells on the remaining plates for any evidence of
cell death, recorded observations.

2.5. Removed   100 % of supernatant wells B2-B4 and C2-C4 on each 96 well
plate.   9:55am  

3\. Added E6 diff media (200uL) to Wells B2-B4 on each plate and Horse serum
diff media to wells C2-C4 on each plate. Left wells D2-D4 untouched.

4\. Returned vessel to incubate at:   10:02am  

  * [x]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (aviary cells)

  

  * Incubator (#78, Library Lab).




### Observations/Summary:

Did not look like there were many cells in E6 condition compared to the other
conditions.
