Process:

  1. Use a T25 flask containing cells (from another experiment) to focus the microscope onto the base of the the flask.
  2. Check the turbidity of all the flasks used for this experiment by holding up the flasks and seeing if the media is clear versus cloudy.
  3. Check the negative control for DMEM/F12+ 10% FBS and CD-CHO + 10 KSR on phase, 20x. These flasks contain sterile filtered media without P/S and they don't contain samples from the 24 deep well plate that was used on OT2. Images captured under culture ID 8733.
  4. Check the T25 flasks containing samples from 24 deep well plate on phase, 20x.
  5. Perform a pH test of the media in all the flasks.

  




Observations/Summary:

All flasks had clear media (not turbid). No contamination was was observed at
20x magnification. pH was ~7 for all flasks which also confirmed that the
media was not contaminated.




SOPs used:

  




Relevant Images/Figures (if applicable):

DMEM/F12 + 10% FBS flasks from top to bottom: negative control, well B2, C4,
D6. No colour change or turbidity.
