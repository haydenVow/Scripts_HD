Summary

Immediately post revival, cell numbers between Cryostor and FBS +DMSO
preserved cells were relatively similar at 412K and 424K cells respectively
while the count for those preserved in DMSO-free Cryostor was lower at 340K.  
  
At the first passage, 6 days after thaw, the cell doubling time was shorted
for those preserved in DMSO-free Cryostor, followed by standard Cryostor and
then FBS+ DMOS freeze media. While the doubling time of cells in DMSO-free
media was almost half that of cells in FBS+ DMSO, statistical significance can
not be inferred due to their being only N=1 of each type.
