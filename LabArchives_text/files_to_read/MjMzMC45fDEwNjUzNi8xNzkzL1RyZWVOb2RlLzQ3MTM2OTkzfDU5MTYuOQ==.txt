Draw (Harvest): AK/SM

Cell suspension removed from bag in ~1hr

Centrifuging started at: 12:00

Harvesting finished at: 18:30

140L of media was pumped out of the STR200 into a palletank bag. This will
then be connected to the centrifuge to harvest the cells.

The Centrifuge was cleaned out with 70% ethanol. At the conclusion of this
rinse we notice chunks coming out of the second waste tube (the one connected
to the bottle of the bowl). It was then noticed that there were maggot like
organisms in this debris.

Centrifuge spun at 70rpm to give a flow rate of 500mL/min.




Preparing sample for regulation:

1\. Transfer the dip tube line into the BSC.

2\. Connect the tubing to a peristaltic pump

3\. Pump at least 350 mL of cell suspension from the 200L bag into a sterile
500 mL container

4\. Cap the dip tube and the 500 mL bottle and transfer the bottle into main
lab.

5\. Prepare the growth factor, Species ID, mycoplasma and genetic drift
samples in the following manner:

  1. Growth factors: Transfer 100 mL of the cell suspension into 2x 50 mL falcon tubes and centrifuge at 1000 rcf for 5 mins to pellet the cells. Decant the supernatant and leave the pellet intact. Store at -80'C
  2. Species ID: Transfer 100 mL of the cell suspension into 2x 50 mL falcon tubes and centrifuge at 1000 rcf for 5 mins to pellet the cells. Decant the supernatant and leave the pellet intact. Store at -80'C
  3. Mycoplasma: Transfer 3 mL of the cell suspension into 2x 1.5mL eppendorf tubes and centrifuge at 450 rcf for 5 mins to pellet the cells. Decant the supernantant into another 1.5 mL tubes careful not to aspirate the cell pellet. Store the tubes at -80'C
  4. Genetic drift: Transfer 100 mL of the cell suspension into 2x 50 mL falcon tubes and centrifuge at 1000 rcf for 5 mins to pellet the cells. Decant the supernatant and leave the pellet intact. Store at -80'C

  

6\. Fill in the following spreadsheet with information on storage and sample
ID




Fill: AK/SM

Filling started at: 12:00

Filling finished at: 17:30

Media being pumped in: MIX-12968

Media Type: 1:1 RPMI/CHO-in-1

Media was pumped into the STR200 at a rate of 1.2 LPM as this kept the input
temp below 41'C and the recorded temp above 36'C.

rpm was slowly ramped up as the volume in the STR200 got larger. At 108L it
was increased to 2 LPM

media filled back up to 180L in the STR200
