50% Feed on 27x10CS and 13x5CS


# Procedure - Feed

# Note: Fibroblasts do NOT require Gelatin coated Flasks, and do NOT require
p38i.  

  1. Turn on the water bath and set to 37'C.
  2. Aliquot  required growth media into a sterile container/s and place into the water bath. 
  3. Place in the water bath and heat for at least 20 minutes.
  4. Observe the cell flasks for confluence under the microscope using 4 x magnification and take images as required. Note: The confluence of cells must be <50% to perform cell feeding in P1-P3 and <80% in P4 prior to the cell differentiation stage. 
  5. Transfer flasks to the BSC and remove required volume of media from each flask (according to the Table below).
  6. Replace the same volume into each flask with the prepared growth media.
  7. Return the flasks to the incubators

20/12 Observations:

Group 1 5CS:

  * Minimal peeling. Slightly peeling from the corners but no aggregations
  * layers look thick

Group 2 5CS:

  * 1x5CS has 2 layers almost completely peeled/aggregated but the other three only have the slightest bit of noticeable peeling in the very corner.
  * 1x5CS has one completely peeled layer (the aggregate is detatched and floating in the media). The other layers are very much attached and only have the slightest peeling in the corner.

Group 3 5CS:

  * Both flasks have only the smallest amount of peeling in the corner of the flask, no aggregate formation. However the sheets look thinner than the 20% FBS conditions.

Group 4 5CS:

  * No aggregate formation and almost no visible peeling. Only the slightest amount of peeling is visible in the corners of the flask for only some layers.

Group 5 5CS:

  * Most visible peeling of all groups.
  * 1x5CS began to peel mid-last week. 3 layers are now completely peeled and floating in the media, 1 other layer is still noticeably partially peeled but has no formed any aggregate yet. 
  * 1x5CS has lots of visible peeling starting from the corners of the flask and extending a few cm in toward the centre, however no sizable aggregate formation is visible yet.
  * Both flasks have had one peeled layer removed at a previous feed (13/12)

Group 6 5CS:

  * 1x5CS has no aggregate formation and very minimal peeling from the corner of the flask
  * 1x5CS has one completely peeled layer and the rest are similar to the other flask

  

Group 1 10CS:

  * partial peeling starting from the corners of the flask with minimal aggregation (1 layer in some flasks)
