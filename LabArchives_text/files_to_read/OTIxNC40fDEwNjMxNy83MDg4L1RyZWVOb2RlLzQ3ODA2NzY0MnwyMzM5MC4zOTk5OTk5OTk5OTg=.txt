Performed by: LL EC
Process
  
  
  1. Set up OT2 deck with working stock dilutions, control media, basal medium (RPMI/HyCellCHO), and ACA (see diagram below - note that basal medium is not shown in this layout) 
  2. Performed OT2 protocol for media mixing (protocol attached below)
    1. Protocol started: 12:55:59 PM
    2. Run time: 00:41:32
  3. While protocol was running, prepared 5 x control media conditions (6 mL of each): 
    1. Control 1: 75/25 RPMI/HyCell + 1:100 ACA 
    2. Control 2: 75/25 RPMI/HyCell + Nuvonis ingredients 
    3. Control 3: 50/50 RPMI/HyCell + Nuvonis ingredients 
    4. Control 4: Freestyle 293 + Nuvonis ingredients 
    5. Control 5: 75/25 RPMI/HyCell + 1:100 ACA + all factors at mid point (note: this mix went very yellow, assumed to be quite acidic)
