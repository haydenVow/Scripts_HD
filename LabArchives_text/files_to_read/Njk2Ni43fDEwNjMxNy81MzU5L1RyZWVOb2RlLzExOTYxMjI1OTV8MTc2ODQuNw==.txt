  1. Prior to imaging, leave the plate open in the BSC ~10 minutes before imaging to evaporate condensation on the lid of the plate, which may affect imaging. Alternatively, wipe the condensation away with ethanol.
  2. Scan 4 x 384-well plates on Zaber imaging platform on Phase, 5x Magnification
    * Exposure: 35ms
    * Imaging sites: 2 rows 1 column per well

  * Note: remember to add '-SCC' to the end of the ID (in the entry box labelled 'directory root') to ensure these images are sent to the ML Model.
  * Follow Zaber image user guide

Observation:

  * I am not sure whether leaving the plates open inside the BSC prior to imaging is helping improve imaging quality as I have noticed the condensation return quickly to the plate lid during the image acquisition inside the Zaber.
