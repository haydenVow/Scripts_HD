Media/Reagents used:

NameDetails  
Growth/Proliferation Media A7448  
  
  
  




Growth Media:

  * [x]  DMEM/F12 + 10% FBS + 1X P/S




Reagent preparation

1\. Aliquoted   5mL   of  Growth Media . Placed in water bath   12:30




Observations

All cultures were examined under the microscope. When adherent cells were
observed, images were taken. See mia links below.

Cells were concerntrated at the centre of the wells in each culture, with the
periphery of the wells being fairly sparse. Culutre 8716 was terminated today
due to sparse population of the well.

Culture  
Observations  
  
8717-F_WALLE02-Bennets Wallaby P1-1of1  
Estimated confluence 50-60% in the centre of the well, but only 10-20% at the
periphery  
  
8716-F_WALLE04-Bennets Wallaby P2-1of1  
Very sparsely populated, even at the periphery of the well. Cells do not have
a healthy fibroblast-like appearance. Terminated this culture today.  
  
8532-F_WALLE02-Bennets Wallaby P1-1of1  
Estimated confluence 40% in the centre of the well, but <10 at the periphery  
  
  
  




Process

  1.  Imaged cultures on 10x magnification
  2. Removed  50 % of supernatant from the seeded wells of the 6-well plates. 12:55

3\. Replaced with   ~~~~0.25 mL of   growth  media.

5\. Returned vessel to incubate at: 12:58
