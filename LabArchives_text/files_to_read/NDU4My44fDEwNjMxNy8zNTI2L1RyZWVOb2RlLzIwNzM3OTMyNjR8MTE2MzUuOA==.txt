## Performed by: Lily Logan and Tom Tarento




Process:

  1. Developed the protocol in protocol designer and attached below
  2. Turned on the OT and setup the deck to perform a water run
    1. Tips for single-channel P1000
    2. Tips for 8-channel P300
    3. 15 mL tube rack for tube of replacement medium
    4. 12 channel reservoir for stain buffer
    5. 50 mL tube rack for bioreactor tubes
    6. Waste reservoir
  3. Prepared a fresh fibroblast cell suspension at ~100k cells/mL
    1. Aliquotted and pre-warmed medium for cell suspension 15:30
    2. Aliquotted medium for medium change 15:30
    3. Thawed vial 15:38 - 15:43
    4. Resuspended cells from vial in the pre-warmed medium
  4. Prepared the stain buffer
    1. Added 15 drops of NucBlue (Hoechst 33342 ReadyProbes reagent) and 15 drops of NucGreen (Sytox Green ReadyProbes reagent) to 3 mL of dPBS in a 15 mL tube
    2. Mixed well by vortexing for 5 seconds
  5. Setup the deck to perform a real run
