NOTE: If cells haven't adhered onto the flask, the flask may be faulty. You
may need to lift cells and re-seed cells into a new T175 flask.

Reference images.

Noticed free floating, whispy strands in the media of the flask, accompanied
with poor adherence. This prompted investigation of culture under the 20x
objective.

Flask was inspected and free floating, wispy mycelium like clusters were
spotted under the 20x objective. Clusters drifted though media as if they were
connected by threads that were not visible. The decision was made to discard
the culture and deep clean the BSC.
