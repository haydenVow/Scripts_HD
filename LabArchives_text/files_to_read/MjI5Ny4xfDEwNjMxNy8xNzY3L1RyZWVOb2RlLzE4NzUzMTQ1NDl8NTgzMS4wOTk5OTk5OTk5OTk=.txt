Growth Media:

  * [ ]  DMEM + 20% FBS + 1X P/S




### Process:

1\. Took image of vessel with microscope on phase setting.

2\. Aliquotted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then
placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath for a minimum of 20 minutes
prior to use:

  1. TrypLE:    15     mL in      1   tubes
  2.  dPBS (for washing and neutralising):   15      mL in   1     tubes
  3. Growth media (for pellet resuspension):   1mL of each media      in    3     tubes
  4. Growth media (for seeding):     12mL of each media    mL in       3  tubes (combined with resuspension media)  

Time that all aliquots were placed in the water bath the warm before use
16:00

Note: if aliquots were placed in water bath at different time, record the time
stamp for each individual solution.




4\. Removed vessel(s) from the incubator   16:28  

5\. Washed the vessel(s) with dPBS (warmed).

6\. Added     5    mL tryple to each vessel/well and incubated at 37˚C.

  1. Start/Finish for TrypLE was   16:35-16:53   

7\. Neutralised with   5ml/Vessel  dPBS and combined cell suspension into a
3x 15mL   tube.

8\. Centrifuged at 650 x g for 5 min.

  1. Start/Finish time for centrifugation was     17:00-17:05 




9\. Aspirated the supernatant(s).

10\. Resuspended pellet(s) in  1       mL      respective    media    17:10

11\. Aliquoted     30     of resuspended cells into a microcentrifuge tube for
cell count.

12\. Performed a cell count using the haemocytometer and recorded the cell
count data in the Google Doc spreadsheet called 'Cell Count Spreadsheet' (see
link below):

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1DPzKubYxfHmWogVPihC-
SSIBtIylyrBQE5kRX5Z8NtI/edit#gid=0

  1.  Total cell number was:     4.950M serum, 2.784M E8 + Goodies and 5.074M Fibrolife        
  
  
  
  

  2. Volume of cell suspension required for subculture was:       106uL (serum), 150uL (E8 +Goodies), 93uL (fibrolife)      

  3. Cell density per vessel:      7K/cm      




13\. Transferred of cell suspension to the pre-warmed      12 resepctive
mL Growth media:    17:40

14\. Transferred cell suspension into the         17:43   vessel.

16\. Transferred vessel(s) to incubate at: 17:50

  * [ x]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells))

Added timepoint at step 4 for when vessel is removed from incubator  
Include at step 11 to aliquot cell resuspension into microcentrifuge tube  
Included at step 10 and 13 time point for when cell pellet is resuspended and
when resuspended cells is moved into growth media.  
Included p38i in table of regent used  
Combined two dPBS entries in 'Media/reagents' table Added 'cell density per
vessel'
