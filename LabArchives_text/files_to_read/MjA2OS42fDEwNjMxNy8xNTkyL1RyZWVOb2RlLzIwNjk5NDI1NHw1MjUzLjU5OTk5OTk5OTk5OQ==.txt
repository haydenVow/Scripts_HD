## Performed by: LL  




Process:

Continuous agitation to facilitate adhesion

  1. Removed the E125 flasks and 50 mL tube spins from the top sanyo incubator in the main lab. 
  2. Added 5 uL of P38i to the 50 mL tube spins and 15 uL to each of the E125 flasks. (final conc 10 uM)  
  3. Transferred cells from the following passage event (attach passage entry here) to each vessel containing equilibrated microcarrier suspensions.  
    1. 682,500 cells into each 50 mL tube spin. (546uL of counted cell suspension from the passage above)
    2. 2,047,500 cells into each of the E125 flasks. (1638uL of counted cell suspension from the passage above)
    3. Each vessel seeded at 68250 cells/mL (3.5 cells per carrier)

  1. Transferred the E125 vessels to incubate at 37 degrees, 5% CO2, incubator (top sanyo), shaking at 120 rpm
  2. Transferred the 50 mL vessels to incubate at 37 degrees, 5% CO2, incubator (bottom sanyo), shaking at 250 rpm
  3. All vessels were left to shake overnight (~0.06W/kg energy dissipation rate for each vessel) [  16:20  ]  
  
Note: E-flasks were mistakenly also put on 250rmp shaker for the first 5 min
of shaking, then moved to 120 rpm shaker. They had fallen off the shaking
platform.
