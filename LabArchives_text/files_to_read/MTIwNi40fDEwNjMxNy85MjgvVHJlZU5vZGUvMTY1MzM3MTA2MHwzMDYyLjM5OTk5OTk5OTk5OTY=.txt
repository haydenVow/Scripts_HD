NOTE: Cell laden scaffolds were transferred to 48 well plates with inserts.
1ml of media was added to each of 32 wells in 2 plates.




Perform feed using below volumes:




Growth Media:

  * [x]  E6

Total media required:   mL

Process:

1\. Added   mL/well of  E6 Media to 64 wells of  2 x 48-well plates . Placed
in incubator for at least 20 minutes  15 :30-16:00

2\. Retrieved 96 well culture plate (ID: 6771) and pre-warmed media plates
from incubator.

3\. inserted 48 well cups and trays into 2x 48 well plates.

4\. Using sterile tweezers, transferred each scaffold to the new 48 well
plates. Created new culture IDs for the new plates 6814 and 6815

5\. Returned vessel to incubate at:

  * [x]  37ÂºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  *   

  * Incubator (thermo), Lab [Main]

NOTE: Cell free scaffolds were not moved to the 48 well plates. Instead, they
remain in the 96 well plate: ID: 6770, and were give a 100% media change with
200ul of fresh E6.
