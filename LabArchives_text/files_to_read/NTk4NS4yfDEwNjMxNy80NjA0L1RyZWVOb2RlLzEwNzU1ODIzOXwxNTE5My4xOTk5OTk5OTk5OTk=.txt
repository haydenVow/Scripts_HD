Prepare materials for harvest and transport to UTS:

1\. Aliquotted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then
brought all aliquots to room temperature prior to use:

  * dPBS, 2 x 400 mL  

  * TrypLE, 2 x 200 mL  

  * CO2 free medium, 150 mL   

2\. Prepared shipping materials:  

  * CO2 growth medium, 2 x 50 mL    

  * Ziploc bag  

  * Old 50 mL tube rack  

  * Bubble wrap (or similar padded packaging material)  

  * Styrofoam box  

  * Identifying label - material contents, hazard warning (if any), date of preparation, person who prepared, sender, receiver, culture conditions  

  

  




# Harvest cells

  1. Discarded spent growth medium from each 4CF
  2. Washed each 4 CF with Add 200 mL of dPBS
  3. Discarded dPBS wash
  4. Added 200 mL of TrypLE to each 4CF
  5. Incubated for at least 15 minutes at 37 deg C: 10:25
  6. Gently agitated each 4CF to dislodged cells
  7. Added 200 mL dPBS to each 4CF to neutralize TrypLE
  8. Repeatedly tapped the side of each 4CF to dislodge cells
  9. Transferred the ~400 mL of cell suspension to centrifuge tubes
  10. Centrifuged at 650 RCF for 5 minutes 10:54
  11. Aspirated supernatants, leaving 1 mL in each centrifuge tube
  12. Resuspended pellets in 1 mL of supernatant
  13. Combined supernatants from F_DOLLY12 into a single 50 mL tube and F_CROC09 into another 50 mL tube
  14. Diluted suspensions to a total volume of 20 mL with growth medium for CO2-free incubation (L15 base)
  15. Took 200 uL sample from each to perform cell count
  16. Performed live/dead cell count of each sample by Trypan blue exclusion using an improve Neubauer hemocytometer and recorded results here: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1DPzKubYxfHmWogVPihC-SSIBtIylyrBQE5kRX5Z8NtI/edit?usp=sharing
    1. F_DOLLY12 total live cell count: 61,520,000
    2. F_CHOMP09 total live cell count: 33,680,000

## Prepared cell suspension for transport

  1. Prepared 50 mL of F_DOLLY12 suspension (transferred 16mL), and 50 mL of F_CHOMP09 suspension (transferred full 20mL), each at ~1.1 million cells/mL in a 50 mL tube, by diluting the samples in the remaining growth medium for CO2-free incubation (L15 base). 
  2. Aliquotted the medium for 5% CO2 incubation into 2x 50 mL tubes
  3. Screwed on the lids of each tube
  4. Wrapped the lids in parafilm
  5. Placed the tubes, along with the tubes for 5% CO2 incubation, into the ziploc bag
  6. Wrapped the ziploc bag in bubble wrap and stood upright in the Styrofoam box
  7. Closed the Styrofoam box and taped down the lid
  8. Stuck the label onto the lid of the Styrofoam box
  9. Placed the Styrofoam box in the lobby area to await collection
  10. Handed over the box to Sajad at 12:07
