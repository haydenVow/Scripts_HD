Process for feed

  1. Growth media pre-warmed to 37C, by placing in the water bath for >15min.
  2. Imaged 1x flask from each condition, and noted observations in the table below.
  3. Cultures removed from the incubator and placed in the BSC
  4. 50% of the growth media removed from each vessel (15mL)
  5. Media replaced with 15mL of each cultures growth medium
  6. Returned to the cell culture incubator, Library Lab #160, 37C and 5% CO2.
