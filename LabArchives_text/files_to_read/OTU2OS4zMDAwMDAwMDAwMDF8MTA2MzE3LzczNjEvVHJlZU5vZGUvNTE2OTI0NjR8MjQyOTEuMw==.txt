## Performed by: Bonnie  




Note

Hoechst/Nuc green staining and counting was performed in addition to duplicate
trypan blue counts, in order to demonstrate discrepancies between the methods.

Since 8/3/22 EGF 10ug/L, IGF,50ug/L is being added to all cultures in this
experiment.

Process:  

  1. Place media in water bath >15min prior to use
  2. Collected E125s from shaker, wiped with ethanol-sprayed Rediwipe, and brought into BSC 
  3. Using a 25 mL serological pipette, gently pipette-mixed culture for 1 minute to break up cell clumps
  4. Transfer suspension into 50 mL tubes.
  5. Centrifuged 50 mL tubes at 300 x g for 5 mins 
  6. Aspirated  75% (15 mL) of supernatant, taking extra care to not disrupt or aspirate pellet.
  7. Resuspended each pellet in the remaining 5mL of media, and took 2x 10ul samples from each culture for hemocytometer counts 
  8. Performed  hemocytometer counts (see below for counts).
  9. Topped up each 50 mL centrifuge tube with 15 mL of fresh pre-warmed media and resuspended cell pellet. 
  10. Pipette-mixed cultures, and transfer all cultures to E250 flask
  11. Took 1x 100 uL sample loaded onto a 96 well plate according to the plate map - note that only cultures intended for continued culture were sampled for Hoechst/ Nuc green staining and counting. 
  12. Returned E250 to incubator

Staining

Prepared Hoechst stain (50 ug/mL) solution in amber/black centrifuge tube:  
\- 9500uL MilliQ  
\- 500uL Hoechst Trihydrochloride trihydrate (1mg/mL)  
\- Vortex for 5 seconds to mix. Solution can be stored at 4Â°C for up to 6
months

Prepared Nuc Green dead stain - 1 drop in 1mL MilliQ.

  1. Took 100 uL samples from each culture flask
  2. Added 20 uL of Hoechst diluted stain directly to cells.
  3. Added 80ul Nuc green solution
  4. Incubated for 30 minutes in the dark at room temperature 
  5. Made 2x, 4x and 8x and dilutions of the sample in dPBS 
  6. Centrifuged plates at 300 g for 1 minute 
  7. Prepared plate map and imaged on the Zaber, then sent for to Mia for cell count analysis, then reimaged 1hr later. Results here:
