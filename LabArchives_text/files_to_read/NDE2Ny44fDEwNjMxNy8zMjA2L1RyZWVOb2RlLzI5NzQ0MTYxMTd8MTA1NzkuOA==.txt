Process:

  1.  Inspected all plates under phase microscopy, 4x objective and recorded observations. 
  2. Aliquotted   2x30mL  mL of  growth Media into separate 50mL tubes
  3. Added  p53 inhibitor to a final concentration of 100uM to one of the 30mL aliquots of growth media. 
  4. Placed in water bath   : a/pm 
  5. Removed  50  % of supernatant from all plates (G1-G4)  
  6. G1 and G3: Replaced with  5 mL of   growth  media. 
  7. G2 and G4: Replaced with 5mL of growth media containing p53 inhibitor. 
  8. Returned vessels to incubate at:

  * [ ]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (aviary cells)

  

  * Incubator (#  ), Lab [Main/Library/Production]
