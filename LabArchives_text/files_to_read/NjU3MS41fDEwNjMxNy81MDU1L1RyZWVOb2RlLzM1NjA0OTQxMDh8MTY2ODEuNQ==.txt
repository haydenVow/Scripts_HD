Reagent preparation:

1\. Centrifuged the secondary antibody stock using the benchtop
microcentrifuge for 10 seconds.

2\. Prepared Secondary Antibody mix (pipette from the top/supernatant of
antibody solution):

   µL   Secondary #1   (1:  ) +   µL   Secondary #2   (1:  ) +    mL Blocking
Buffer (PBST (0.1% Triton X + dPBS) + 3% BSA)  

If using AlexaFluor secondary antibodies then the max concentration should be
1:500 (typically used at 1:1000)

Pipette-mixed antibody mix and stored refrigerated away from light until
needed.

3\. Prepared DAPI mix:

   mL  PBS +    uL  of DAPI (1:1000)

Vortexed DAPI mix and stored refrigerated away from light until needed.

Process:

1\. Removed plate from fridge (incubated in primary antibodies overnight).

2\. Washed 3 times for 5 min with PBS at RT.

3\. Incubated the cells with secondary antibody mixture in the dark at RT for
1 hour.  : - : a/pm

NOTE: from this step onwards protect from the light by wrapping plates in foil
and perform experiment in the dark.




Counter staining

1\.  Removed 2nd antibody solution.  : a/pm

2\.  Washed with DAPI (1:1000) in PBS for 5 min at RT in the dark.
