1\. Weigh out RPMI:CHO-in-1 (50:50) powder according to this spreadsheet.

2\. Store at 4'C until required for hydration.

Hydrating the growth medium:

1\. Cleaned the mixing tank first by pumping in 30L of ID water and 2% m(w/v)
of adcip.

2\. Turn on the recirc pump and leave it running for a minimum of 10 mins.
Pump the waste into the waste drain.

3\. Add 700L worth of ID water into the tank.

4\. Add all the powders directly into the tank with the stirrer on.

5\. Switch on the recirc pump to circulate the medium for at least 20 mins.

6\. Periodically sample the media from the sample port for any undissolved
reagents. Continue recirculating until all the powders are dissolved.

7\. Once dissolved switch off the recirc pump and leave the stirrer running.

8\. The media can now be added to the bag or palletank bag.




Filtering the growth media

1\. Prepare a length of advantaflex tubing (1/2" \- 3/4") with a hose barb TC
connector on one end and capped on the other with either a NPC connector + cap
or biosealed. Separately prepare an o-ring gasket and TC clamp in another
autoclave bag

2\. Autoclave both at 121'C for 20 mins

3\. Once autoclaved transfer both bags into a BSC

4\. Transfer the filter unit into the BSC as well

Sartopore 2 XLM (0.2/0.1 um) 20 inch Catalogue number: 5448358M2G-SS

5\. Aseptically connect the hose barb ending of the advantaflex tubing to the
hose barb ending on the sterile end of the filter unit with an O-ring gasket
in between the two parts.

6\. Secure the configuration together with the TC clamp

7\. Remove the setup from the BSC and weld the advantaflex to the dip tube on
the STR 2000L bag (1/2" \- 3/4")

8\. Connect a portion of silicone tubing from the mixing tank to the non
sterile end of the filter unit.

9\. Connect the tubing to a peristaltic pump and begin pumping media through
the filter into the STR 2000L bag at 265 RPM.

10\. Wait until the media finishes filtering (this particular filter unit
could pump 230L of media an hour)

11\. Once finished add 30L of water and 2% adcip.

12. Turn on the recirc pump and leave it running for a minimum of 10 mins. Pump the waste into the waste drain.

13\. Add another 30L of water and 2-5% sanitiser

14\. Turn on the recirc pump and leave it running for a minimum of 10 mins.
Pump the waste into the waste drain.

15\. Wash the tank with a final 30L of water.
