  1. Retrieve a 10 mL aliquot of Hycell and Freestyle spent media for pH testing
  2. Calibrate the pH probe and obtain a recording of the pH for both the Hycell and Freestyle waste media
    1. Hycell - 6.9 pH
    2. Freestyle - 6.8 pH
  3. Prepare a 1 g/mol solution of sodium bicarbonate in 50 mL of MilliQ water
    1. 4.20035 g in 50 mL
  4. Add small quantities (100 uL - can increase if the media requires more sodium bicarbonate) of the sodium bicarbonate solution to the Hycell and Freestyle aliquots and monitor the pH recordings until the pH reaches 7.4
    1. Hycell - 1400 uL (final pH: 7.4) (final volume: 11.4 mL)
    2. Freestyle - 900 uL (final pH: 7.4) (final volume 10.9 mL)
  5. Discard samples and wash pH probe with MilliQ and return to storage.
