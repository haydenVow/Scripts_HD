Perform thaw using below volumes:

  




## Performed by: Bonnie Tangey  




Note  
  
Due to the poor attachment of cells post thaw, I am concerned that the cell
density is too low for the cells to proliferate well, and that it will take a
long time to grow the number of cells needed for the experiment. I am
therefore repeating the thaw, and seeding at a higher density. Any cells which
are not used for the experiment can be frozen as a WCB. Due the thawing into a
low volume of media, cells will be re-suspended in 10mL media per via vial to
wash, and then centrifuged to remove residual Cryostor prior to plating.

Prepare materials for thaw and seed:

  * Growth media (for washing):    15mL  OPTI media, 5mL KSR media  

  * Pre-filled 2x T75 and 1 xT175 with OptiPro Media, + 1xT75 with KSR media and placed in the incubator to warm and equilibrium. 
  * Time that aliquot/ flasks were placed in the water/incubator bath to warm before use:  16:50

  




## Thaw and seed vial:

3\. Collected the cryovial from Liquid Nitrogen storage & place in foam
floater in water bath for 3 min

`4. Ethanol sprayed & transferred the vial(s) to the BSC.`

`5.  Added  500µL of Growth Media (to generate a total volume of 1mL in the
cryovial) to the cryovial, resuspended the cell suspension gently to reduce
osmotic shock. `

`6. Collected the entire cell suspension & transfer into 50mL centrifuge tubes
containing 10mL prewarmed media`

`7. Centrifuge for 10min at 500g`

`8. Removed 9mL supernatant and re-ssupended cells in the remaining 1ml.`

`9. ``Transverred into`` T75 flasks, 1 flask for KHAKIO, DUCKEYE and MUSCK +
t175 FOR MUSCO```

`10. Transfered flask/plate(s) to incubate at: 18:10`

  * [ x ]  37ºC, 5% CO2, Incubator #77 Library lab.
