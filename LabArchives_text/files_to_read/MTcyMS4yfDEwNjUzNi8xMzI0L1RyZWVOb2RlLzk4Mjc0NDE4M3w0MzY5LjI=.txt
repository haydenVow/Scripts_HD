50% Feed on 28x10CS and 1x5CS


# Procedure - Feed

# Note: Fibroblasts do NOT require Gelatin coated Flasks, and do NOT require
p38i.  

  1. Turn on the water bath and set to 32'C.
  2. Aliquot  required growth media into a sterile container/s and place into the water bath. 
  3. Place in the water bath and heat for at least 20 minutes.
  4. Observe the cell flasks for confluence under the microscope using 4 x magnification and take images as required. Note: The confluence of cells must be <90% to perform cell feeding.
  5. Transfer flasks to the BSC and remove required volume of media from each flask (according to the Table below).
  6. Replace the same volume into each flask with the prepared growth media.
  7. Return the flasks to the incubators

Extra sterility measures taken:

  * All flasks coming out of the big thermo were wiped down with F10 and then ethanol before going into the BSC. The shelves/walls of this section of the incubator was also wiped down
  * On each flask the media ID, date and initial of the person doing the feed were written
  * The BSC bench was wiped down with Ethanol in between feeding flasks from different incubators
  * The lids of each flask were also inspected for fungal contamination
