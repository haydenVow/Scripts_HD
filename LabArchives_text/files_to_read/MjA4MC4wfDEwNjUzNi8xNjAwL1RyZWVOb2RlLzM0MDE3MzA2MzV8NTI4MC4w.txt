Due to a faulty weld with the Biowelder the new base bottle could not be
attached to the STR200 therefore the reactor was left overnight (14/06)
without a base bottle. The pH was seemingly maintained but the cells were not
healthy the next day (15/06).

These cells were originally meant for seeding into the STR2000 however due to
the low viability (44%) the remaining volume in the bag was completed
harvested using continuous centrifuge and pellets frozen down instead.
