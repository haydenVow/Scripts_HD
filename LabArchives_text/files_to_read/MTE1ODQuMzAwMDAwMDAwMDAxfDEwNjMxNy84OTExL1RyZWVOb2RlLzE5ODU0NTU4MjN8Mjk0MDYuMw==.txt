Aim/Purpose


To determine whether supplementing cells in culture with glucose and ala-gln
will increase maximum cell density in 50/50 RPMI/CHO Nunvonis suspension
medium


Hypothesis


That one of the five feeding schedules will result in a higher maximum density
than we have previously observed in culture with 50/50 RPMI/CHO Nunvonis
suspension medium


Technical Gap


We have seen improved maximum density through increasing the concentration of
glucose and ala-gln/L-glutamine (EPIC31429). We have yet to see if topping up
glucose and ala-gln levels as they are depleted by growing cells can further
improve maximum density.


Method/Procedure


Brief research summary (from background section)

  * L-Glutamine and glucose tend to decrease in a similar fashion
  * L-Glutamine and Ala-Gln typically fall by 1 mM per day in batch culture in bioreactors
  * Cell growth appears to be negatively impacted when L-glutamine reaches ~1-2 mM
  * The rate of glucose depletion seems to be a lot more varied than L-glutamine/Ala-Gln 
  * MFG have observed a general glucose depletion rate of 1 g/L 
  * We know from the day 0 supplementation results that higher levels of Ala-Gln (>4mM) do not appear to be detrimental to cell growth, however higher levels of glucose can be harmful (> 8g/L). 
  * HiMedia top up their glucose & L-glutamine when glucose levels fall to 3 g/L, and they start adding their "feed" supplement from day 3 and then every 48 hours after that 

Overview of feeding schedule conditions

  * Starting concentration of ala-gln is 4 mM (from the day 0 supplementation results)
  * Starting concentration of glucose is 7.4 g/L (from the day 0 supplementation results)  
  

  * Condition 1: feed every 48h (starting day 3)  
    * Supplement with 2 mM Ala-Gln 
    * Supplement with 2 g/L glucose 
  * Condition 2: feed every 72h (starting day 3)  
    * Supplement with 3 mM Ala-Gln 
    * Supplement with 3 g/L glucose
  * Condition 3: feed every 72h (starting day 3)  
    * Supplement with 3 mM Ala-Gln 
    * Supplement with 2 g/L glucose 
  * Condition 4: base feeding schedule off glucose readings on urine test kit and assume glucose levels are at higher end of scale (testing from day 1)  
    * Test glucose levels daily 
    * When glucose falls into 2.5-5 g/L range, supplement with 2 g/L glucose 
    * Supplement with the appropriate amount of Ala-Gln based on 1 mM per day consumption rate 
  * Condition 5: base feeding schedule off glucose readings on urine test kit and assume glucose levels are at lower end of scale (testing from day 1)     
    * We will test glucose levels daily 
    * When glucose falls into 2.5-5 g/L range, supplement with 4 g/L
    * Supplement with the appropriate amount of Ala-Gln based on 1 mM per day consumption rate 
  * Control 1: No feeding
    * Growth medium = 50/50 RPMI/CHO Nuvonis growth medium (with glucose, ala-gln, & HT) 
  * Control 2: No feeding
    * Growth medium = 50/50 RPMI/CHO Nuvonis growth medium (with glucose, ala-gln, without HT)
