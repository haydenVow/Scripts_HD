### Process:

1\. Took image of vessel with microscope on phase setting.

3\. Removed the required reagents from fridge 104 (blue test tube rack) in
library lab and placed in water bath at 30C  for 20 minutes prior to use:

For feeds:

1. 3mL DMEM + 20% FBS + 1 x PS (for culture 7936)15:16pm  
2\. 3mLM199+ 20% FBS + 1 x PS (For cultures 7925 and 7935) 15:16pm  

For Passage

  1. TrypLE:     3   mL in      1   tubes
  2.  dPBS (for neutralising):     3   mL
  3.  dPBS (for washing):       3  mL
  4. DMEM + 20% FBS + 1 x PS (for culture 7971 pellet resuspension):     1    mL
  5. DMEM + 20% FBS + 1 x PS (for culture 7971 seeding)::     30    mL

Time that all aliquots were placed in the water bath the warmed to 30C before
use   time 13:25  

Note: if aliquots were placed in water bath at different time, record the time
stamp for each individual solution.




Passage

  1.  Removed vessel(s) ~~  7724 and 7722 ~~7871from the incubator   time 15:09    

  2. Washed the vessel(s) with dPBS (warmed).
  3. Added   3 mL tryple to each vessel/well and incubated at 30ËšC.
  4. Start/Finish for TrypLE was   time  15:11 - 15:24  

  5. Neutralised each well with   3 mL   dPBS and transferred to   15 mL    tube.
  6. Centrifuged at 650 x g for 5 min.
  7. Start/Finish time for centrifugation was   time 15:27 - 15:32  

  8. Aspirated the supernatant(s).
  9. Resuspended pellet(s) in   1  mL   growth   media
  10.  Aliquoted   10uL  of resuspended cells into a microcentrifuge tube for cell count.
  11. Performed a cell count using the haemocytometer and recorded the cell count data in the Google Doc spreadsheet called 'Cell Count Spreadsheet' (see link below):

SSIBtIylyrBQE5kRX5Z8NtI/edit#gid=0

    1. Total cell number was:     1,752,000   

    2. Volume of cell suspension required for subculture was:  
      1. 0.700 mL to seed T175 with ~7K cells/cm2 (30 mL GROWTH MEDIA)  

      2. 0.300mL to seed T75 with ~7kcells/cm2 (12 mL GROWTH MEDIA)  

    3. Cell density per vessel:    ~7K/cm   
    4. Seeded 1xT175 and 1xT75 with approx 7K cells/cm2  

    5. 13\. Incubate at 30C and 5% CO2. time 16:00

Observations

After 11 minuites in tryple, you can see aggregates of cells in the flask.
Upon observation under the microscope you can see clusters of cells (>100).
