Harvest Process:

Aliquoted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then
placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath > 30 minutes prior to use

  1. Observed cultures under the microscope and recorded confluence in the table above. 
  2. Imaged cultures on 10x magnification (captured in Mia)
  3. TrypLE:   50   mL 
  4. dPBS (for washing & neutralising)   100 mL
  5. Growth media (for pellet resuspension and seeding):   30 mL
  6. Washed the flask(s) with dPBS.
  7. Added   10 mL  tryple to each vessel/well and incubated at 37ËšC for    10 mins 
  8. Neutralised with   10 mL dPBS (warmed) and combined cell suspension into a   50 tube.
  9. Centrifuged at 650 x g for 5 min.
  10. Aspirated+ discarded supernatant
  11. Resuspended pellet(s) in     20mL media.  
Performed cell count triplicates using the hemocytometer and recorded the cell
count data in widget or the Google Doc spreadsheet called 'Cell Count
Spreadsheet' (see link below):

  12. Total cell number was: 49,900,000 




Cell Plating Process:

  1. Calculated the total number of cells needed for this assay + margin of error.
  2. Calculated volume of resuspension for column 2 + margin of error. See attached calculations as an example: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1LJ8o3Vk9UI4z1t0zFdHdsyM1I83PEtl0xqi00w4_Yw/edit#gid=1244524761 
  3. Centrifuged required cells at 650 g x 5 mins: 
  4. Aspirated + discarded supernatant. 
  5. Resuspended pellet in required volume: 1920 ul 
  6. Dispensed 200 ul of cells per well to column 2.
  7. Added 100 ul of media per well to each dilution columns and blank columns: columns 1 & 3-10
  8. Aspirated 100 ul of cells per well from column 2 and mixed into column 3 with media. 
  9. Repeated step 8 into each subsequent column for serial dilution until column 9. 
  10. Aspirated and discarded 100 ul per well from column 9. 

  




Assay Process:

  1. Added 10 ul of WST-8 Solution per wells. 
  2. Measured the absorbance increase at 460nm at time points below:
