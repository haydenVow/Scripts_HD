Perform feed using below volumes:




Growth Media:

  * E6 (1X P/S)
  * DMEM/F12 + 20% FBS + 1X P/S (with or without 50ug/mL L-ascorbic acid)

Process:

1\. Prepare E6 media (150 mL total) according to the google spreadsheet
calculator below:  
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/124elwh67VrPyq7zPMqVI_g3-NUiVigjjaF64dVxeZa0/edit#gid=1366115577

2\. Aliquotted  30  mL of  E6 (1X P/S) into  wells from row 3-6 (2 mL each),
4mL of DMEM/F12 mixture without L-ascorbic acid for wells A2 and C2 and 4 mL
of DMEM/F12 mixture with L-ascorbic acid for wells B2 and D2   . Placed in
incubator for at least 30 minutes prior to transferring inserts   11:10

3\. Carefully remove inserts from original plate containing proliferation
media and transfer into new plate containing pre-warmed E6 differentiation
media.

4\. Returned vessel to incubate at:

  * [x]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (aviary cells)

  

  * [x]  Thermo Incubator (ID #13)
  * [ ]  Top Sanyo Incubator (ID #25)
  * [ ]  Bottom Sanyo Incubator
  * [ ]  Top Binder Incubator
  * [ ]  Bottom Binder Incubator
