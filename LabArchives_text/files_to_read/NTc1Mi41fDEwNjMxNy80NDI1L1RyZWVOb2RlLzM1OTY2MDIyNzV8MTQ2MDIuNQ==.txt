Process:

  1. Aliquotted  40 mL  mL of  DMEM/F12 + 20% FBS + 1X P/S + 10uM p38i Media (For both Addy and my experiment)
  2. Added   20 uL  mL of p38i. 
  3. Placed in water bath 2:03 - 3:45  pm 
  4. Removed  50  % of supernatant from vessel. 
  5. Replaced with  100 uL (per well/per vessel) of  Growth   media. 
  6. Returned vessel to incubate at:

  * [X]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (aviary cells)

  

  * Incubator (# 52), Lab [Main]

*Note: These are the flasks we originally wanted to use on Friday to seed into our 4 x 96 wp however, they had not grown enough. We left them over the weekend and this is what they look like today. We should further investigate the reason for the observed cell death.
