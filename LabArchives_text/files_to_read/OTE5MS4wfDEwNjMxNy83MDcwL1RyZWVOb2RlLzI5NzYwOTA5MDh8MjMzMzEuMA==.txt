See entry here for media preparation.  




Passage

Not required and not performed  

  1.  ~~Calculated required media for new E125 flask with required media for 50 000 cells/mL in 30mL final volume (made up of old cell suspension and new media). Used seeder widget to calculate required volume of cell suspension~~
    *  ~~Required cell suspension:          
~~

    *  ~~Required new medium:          
~~

  2. ~~Added required growth factors to media, calculated fromMedia Calculator~~
    *  ~~+EGF:         ~~
    *  ~~+IGF:         ~~
  3.  ~~Incubated media at    37   째C for       minutes~~
  4.  ~~Removed vessel from incubator and performed media change/passage: <indicate which here by strikeout>~~
    *  ~~added newly prepared media and added cell suspension drop-wise~~
    *  ~~Returned vessel to shaking incubation at 37 째C~~

Media Change

  * Prepared 20mL new media with growth factors added
  * Added 20mL media to flask
  * Incubated media in bead bath for 30 mins; 17:30-18:00
  * Added media to cells and returned vessel to shaking incubation
  * new cell density = 324 000 cells/mL

pH measurement

  1. Collected 100uL sample from cell counting and used pipette to add drop-wise to pH colour indicator strip on bench
  2. Allowed colour change reaction to proceed over ~30 seconds
  3. Imaged indicator strip next to colour change indicator chart

pH reading: ~7
