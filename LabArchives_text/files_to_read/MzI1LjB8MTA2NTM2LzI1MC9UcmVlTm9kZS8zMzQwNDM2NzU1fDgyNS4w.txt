In House: Set 6 - 24hr E-flask 6x(2xE250) Harvest


Experiment Plan:




Procedure - E125 Harvest

  1. Pre-weigh 50mL centrifuge tubes recording the weights on the tubes and clearly label with the condition name (one for each flask in each experimental condition = 9)
  2. Pour the contents of each E-flask into their corresponding pre-weighed centrifuge tube. 
  3. Using a serological pipette dispense 20mL dPBS into each flask as a final wash. Add this dPBS to the pre-weighed centrifuge tube with corresponding condition.
  4. Once all aggregates and dPBS has been added to the centrifuge tubes, Centrifuge at 700 x g for 5 minutes.````
  5. Gently remove centrifuge tubes from the machine, ensuring not to disturb the cell pellets. Aspirate as much supernatant as possible from the tubes. Discard supernatant. Remove as much remaining supernatant with a 1mL pipette.
  6. Spin these tubes once more at 700 x g for 5 minutes
  7. Remove any supernatant present with a 1mL pipette
  8. Weigh the cell pellets

  


No treatment
VitC 50ug/mL ONLY
VitC 50ug/mL + TGFb 10ng/mL


Observations after 24 hrs:

Cells had all settled to the bottom for ALL flasks. No visible differences
between treatment groups. After some swirling of the flask, all cells went
back into suspension for all conditions. No visible aggregates for any
conditions.

  

Viability Check:

3ul of each flask was combined for each condition, and then diluted with
Trypan blue to check under the microscope. By visual estimate, ~40% of cells
were dead for all conditions.

Control



Vit C ONLY  

  
  

Vit C + TGF-b
