Media/Reagents used:

  

NameDetails (reagent ID)  
0.1% gelatin solution  
  
Tryple  
  
dPBS (for washing & neutralising)  
  
Growth Media  
  
p38i (20mM stock)  
  
Freeze media  
  
  
  

  




Process:

 1\. Aliquotted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and
then placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath for a minimum of 20 minutes
prior to use:

  1.  TrypLE: 200 mL in | 1 | tubes
  2.  dPBS (for neutralising)  200 mL in | 1 | tubes 
  3.  Growth media (for pellet resuspension):  40 mL in | 1 | tubes 
  4.  Time that all aliquots were placed in the water bath to warm before use:  10:10 am 

Note: if aliquots were placed in water bath at different times, record the
time stamp for each individual solution.




2\. Washed the flask(s) with dPBS.

3\. Added | 200 |mL tryple to each vessel/well and incubated at 37ºC for |
10-15 | mins:   10:34 - 10:55 am

4\. Neutralised with | 200 mL | dPBS (warmed) and combined cell suspension
into a | 2 x 200mL | tubes.

5\. Centrifuged at 650 x g for 5 min

  1.  Start/Finish time for centrifugation was:   11:01 - 11:06 am   




6\. Aspirated the supernatant(s).

7\. Resuspend pellet(s) in | 40 |mL | Growth | media.

8\. Performed a cell count using the haemocytometer and recorded the cell
count data in the Google Doc spreadsheet called 'Cell Count Spreadsheet' (see
link below):

SSIBtIylyrBQE5kRX5Z8NtI/edit#gid=0

9\. Total cell number was: | 96M |

10\. Calculate the required volume cell suspension & freeze medium to generate
a concentration of ~2M cells/mL.




11\. Aliquotted  43 mL Freeze Medium: (CryoStor10). ID # Stock 5336  

Stored at 4ºC until use to keep chilled.

12\. Centrifuged cells at 650 x g for 5 min.  12:02  \- 12:07 pm

Whilst centrifuge is spinning, prepared & printed vial labels, labelled
cryovials. (Note that passage number will be the same as the culture you
harvest from. The passage number will increase by 1 during the revive of a
vial.)




1\. Transferred 435uL (1M cells) into 6 x 15mL tubes. Fill with dPBS

2\. Centrifuge at 650 x g for 5 min at RT.

3\. Aspirate supernatant.

4\. Place tubes in -80C freezer (main lab, top section)




13\. Aspirated supernatant carefully, taking care not to disturb the pellet.

14\. Resuspended the pellet in | 43 |mL freeze media (chilled, to reduce DMSO
toxicity).

15\. Aliquotted | 1000 |µL into | 43 | x cryovials (already labelled).

16\. Tightened the lids & transfer the cryovials to a Mr. Frosty immediately
into the -80ºC freezer.   12:25 pm

  * [ ]  Without foam
  * [ ]  1st Freeze
  * [ ]  2nd Freeze
  * [ ]  3rd Freeze
  * [ ]  4th Freeze
  * [ X]  5th Freeze

17\. Allow the cells to freeze for at least 18-24 hours before transferring to
Liquid Nitrogen storage.
