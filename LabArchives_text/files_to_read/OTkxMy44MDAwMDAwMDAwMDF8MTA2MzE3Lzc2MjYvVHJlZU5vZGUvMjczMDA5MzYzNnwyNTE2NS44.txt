### Process:

1\. Took image of vessel with microscope on phase setting. Include link in
image section

2\. Gelatin coated          x          vessel  with sterile filtered 0.1%
gelatin solution and then incubated all coated flasks at 37˚C.

  1. Time when all vessels(s) placed into the incubator       :   a/pm 

3\. Aliquotted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then
placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath for a minimum of 20 minutes
prior to use:

  1. TrypLE:         mL in 
  2.  dPBS (At 37 degrees for washing):         mL 
  3.  dPBS (at RT neutralising):         mL 
  4. Growth media (for pellet resuspension):         mL 
  5. Growth media (for seeding):         mL

Time that all aliquots were placed in the water bath the warm before use     :
a/pm

Note: if aliquots were placed in water bath at different time, record the time
stamp for each individual solution.




4\. Removed vessel(s) from the incubator     :   a/pm

5\. Washed the vessel(s) with dPBS (warmed).

6\. Added     10    mL tryple to each vessel/well and incubated at 37˚C.

  1. Start/Finish for TrypLE was     :   a/pm 

7\. Neutralised with     10     dPBS and combined cell suspension into a
tube.

8\. Centrifuged at 650 x g for 5 min.

  1. Start/Finish time for centrifugation was     :   a/pm 




9\. Aspirated the supernatant(s).

10\. Resuspended pellet(s) in         mL          media     :   a/pm

11\. Aliquoted          of resuspended cells into a microcentrifuge tube for
cell count.

12\. Performed a cell count using the haemocytometer and recorded counts in
"Seed Calculator" widget (see below):




13\. Transferred           µl of cell suspension to the pre-warmed
mL Growth media:      :    a/pm

14\. Transferred cell suspension into the             pre-gelatin coated
vessel.

15\. Left at RT in the BSC for 30 min to allow cells to settle      :  \-  :
a/pm  

16\. Transferred vessel(s) to incubate at:

  * [x]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)  Incubator:           
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (avian cells)
