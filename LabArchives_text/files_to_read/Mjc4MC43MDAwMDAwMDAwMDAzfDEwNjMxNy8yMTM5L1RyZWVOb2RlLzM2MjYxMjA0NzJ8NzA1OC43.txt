Perform passage using below volumes:  




## Performed by: LL  




Observations/Summary:

\- Cells not passaged as all cells in ACF-media are no longer adhered and are
therefore presumed dead

\- Flasks discarded




Relevant Images/Figures (if applicable):

Culture 7240 (serum-control)  



  

Culture 7241

### Process:

1\. Took image of vessel with microscope on phase setting.

2\. Gelatin coated     3 or 4      x     T25     vessel with sterile filtered
0.1% gelatin solution and then incubated all coated flasks at 37˚C.

  1. Time when all vessels(s) placed into the incubator       :   a/pm 

3\. Aliquotted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then
placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath for a minimum of 20 minutes
prior to use:

  1. TrypLE:     10-13    mL in     1    tubes
  2.  dPBS (for washing and neutralising):     20-26    mL in   1     tubes
  3. Growth media (for pellet resuspension):     1    mL of each media in     3    tubes
  4. Growth media (for seeding):     5    mL of each media in     3    tubes

Time that all aliquots were placed in the water bath the warm before use     :
a/pm

Note: if aliquots were placed in water bath at different time, record the time
stamp for each individual solution.




4\. Removed vessel(s) from the incubator     :   a/pm

5\. Washed the vessel(s) with dPBS (warmed).

6\. Added     3    mL tryple to each vessel/well and incubated at 37˚C.

  1. Start/Finish for TrypLE was     :   a/pm 

7\. Neutralised with    3      dPBS and combined cell suspension into a
tube.

8\. Centrifuged at 650 x g for 5 min.

  1. Start/Finish time for centrifugation was     :   a/pm 




9\. Aspirated the supernatant(s).

10\. Resuspended pellet(s) in     0.5    mL   of respective growth   media
:   a/pm

11\. Aliquoted      10 uL    of resuspended cells into a microcentrifuge tube
for cell count.

12\. Performed a cell count using the haemocytometer and recorded the cell
count data in the Google Doc spreadsheet called 'Cell Count Spreadsheet' (see
link below):

SSIBtIylyrBQE5kRX5Z8NtI/edit#gid=0

  1.  Total cell number was:  
    1. serum:         
    2. 10C(Reprokine):          
    3. 10C(PeproTech):         
    4. 10C(no FGF): optional         
  2. Volume of cell suspension required for subculture was equivalent to 25 000 cells:   
    1. serum:         
    2. 10C(Reprokine):          
    3. 10C(PeproTech):         
    4. 10C(no FGF): optional         
  3. Cell density per vessel:      1000 cell/cm^2     




13\. Transferred           µl of cell suspension to the pre-warmed      5
mL Growth media for each condition:      :    a/pm

14\. Transferred cell suspension into the pre-gelatin coated      T25
vessel.

15\. Left at RT in the BSC for 30 min to allow cells to settle      :  \-  :
a/pm  

16\. Transferred vessel(s) to incubate at:

  * [X]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (avian cells)

### Results:

  * Results were;
    * [ ]  As Usual (this is a repetitive task)
    * [x]  Unexpected because...all cells in ACF-media are dead (see images below - cultures 7241, 7243, 7244) 
    * [ ]  Need to be further analysed
    * [ ]  Other (.......)
