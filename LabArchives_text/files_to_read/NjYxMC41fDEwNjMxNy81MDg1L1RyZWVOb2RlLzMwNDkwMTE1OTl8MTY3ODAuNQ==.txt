## Remove the Stimulation Lead Wire

1\. Removed the hook test clips from the electrode connection pins on the
culture dish lid  
  
The test hook can be released from the pin by squeezing the spring loaded test
hook handle. It is best not to touch the metal electrode pins while doing
this. Hold the plastic culture dish lid for stability. If any wires become
dislodged and the operator is unsure about reattachment, contact experiment
owner for assistance   Jared - 0420881185




## Imaging (optional)

1\. Imaged BOTH PLATES, taking whole well images of every well using the zaber
time

For information on how to use the zaber, refer to:

Tips for imaging the 12WP are to use 8x8 imaging sites in the HSC site
generator, remembering to change the spacing rule to field of view with 60 um
spacing. Remember to build the MM List in the HSC site generator and confirm
the number of images expected (usually >700) in the Mult-D Acq.




Media Change

Aliquot (48mL) in biomaterials fridge in shared Gains&Chains 120mL tub
labelled 'SAT' on lid with 'E6 M6787 GAINS/CHAINS'.  
  
1\. Retrieved  36 mL  of  E6 Media from a 90 mL shared gains and chains
aliquot in   1x 50 mL  tube from the biomaterials fridge.  
  
2\. Aliquots placed in water bath   11:40 am

3\. Removed  100% of supernatant from vessel.

4\. Replaced with  1.5 mL (per well/per vessel) of   E6 diff media.

5\. Returned vessels to incubate and connected the test hooks back up to the
electrode pins on the culture dish lid so that each set of hooks connects to
the corresponding wire colour and so that the black hooks are aligned on the
left side of each well and the red hooks on the right (see wiring setup
reference image below)   12:15
