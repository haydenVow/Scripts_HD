# Procedure - Feed

# Note: Fibroblasts do NOT require Gelatin coated Flasks, and do NOT require
p38i.  

  1. Turn on the water bath and set to 37'C.
  2. Aliquot  required growth media into a sterile container/s and place into the water bath. 
  3. Place in the water bath and heat for at least 20 minutes.
  4. Observe the cell flasks for confluence under the microscope using 4 x magnification and take images as required. Note: The confluence of cells must be <50% to perform cell feeding in P1-P3 and <80% in P4 prior to the cell differentiation stage. 
  5. Transfer flasks to the BSC and remove required volume of media from each flask (according to the Table below).
  6. Replace the same volume into each flask with the prepared growth media.
  7. Return the flasks to the incubators

Feed 2 - VitC Treatment (50ug/mL)


Flasks are at 100% confluence:  


Feed 2 - VitC Treatment (5mg/mL)


Flasks are at 98-100% confluence (looks very similar to that of 50ug/mL vit C
treated flasks). There also appeared to be more floating dead cells than in
the 50ug/mL vit C flasks.  
  


Feed 2 - Normal Feed


Control flasks were only at 85-90% confluence:  

  

Gelatin flasks were at 100% confluence. The cells also appeared more compact
together, and more 'aligned' with each other in comparison to non-coated
flasks:

  

Collagen Coated flasks were 100% confluent. with a few odd areas of lack of
cells (or stranger morphology) which is probably due to the coating. These
cells also appeared more compact and aligned together than non-coated flasks.






Observation on 11/08/21:  
Flask 7606 (Vit C 50ug/mL) had a circular aggregate of cells in the middle of
the flasks. The other 2 flasks of this condition had no aggregates.

Under the microscope it was observed that very few cells were on the outside
of the aggregate ring (middle image), but inside the cells were still
completely adhered and fully confluent (last image).
