Responses to contamination events

  * Cleaning with F10 \- For most contamination events occuring for batchs 34-36, flasks that were housed in the same incubator as an infected flask were wiped with F10 and the shelves of the incubator also wiped with F10.
  * Refiltering TGF-b and Vit C aliquots before use \- After the mass contamination of batch 36, it was hypothesised this was introduced through an aliquot of TGF-b or Vit C that may have been contaminated, or during a point of the passage where all cells were combined and contamination introduced at this point. 

Added measures for reducing contamination risks and increasing traceability

  * wiping all flasks with ethanol before transferring into the BSC
  * changing gloves when entering Production Lab and more frequently between work
  * spraying gloves with F10 as well as ethanol 
  * During feeds, writing initials of person handling flask, media ID, and date
  * adding F10 to metal waterbath 
  * For batches 39 & 40:
    * planning weekly F10 deep cleans of all incubators
    * Weekly F10 deep cleans of BSCs 
    * new Vit C and TGF stock solutions
