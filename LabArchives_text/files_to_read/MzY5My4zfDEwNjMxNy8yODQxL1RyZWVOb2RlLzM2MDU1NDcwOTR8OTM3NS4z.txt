Growth Media:

  * [x ]  DMEM/F12 + 10% FBS + 1X P/S 




### Process:

1\. Took 2x image of vessel with microscope on phase setting.  

3\. Aliquotted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then
placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath for a minimum of 20 minutes
prior to use: time

  1. TrypLE:    3    mL in       1 tube
  2.  dPBS (for washing and neutralising):    3   mL 
  3. dPBS (for neutralising):    3    mL
  4. Growth media (for pellet resuspension):   3  mL 
  5. Growth media (for seeding):   L in  

Time that all aliquots were placed in the water bath the warm before use
10:10  

Note: if aliquots were placed in water bath at different time, record the time
stamp for each individual solution.




4\. Removed vessel(s) from the incubator     10:21

5\. Washed the vessel(s) with dPBS (warmed).

6\. Added    3   mL tryple to each vessel/well and incubated at 37˚C.

  1. Start/Finish for TrypLE was    10:29 - 10:45    

7\. Neutralised with    3   dPBS and combined cell suspension.

8\. Centrifuged at 650 x g for 5 min.

  1. Start/Finish time for centrifugation was     10:54 - 10:59    




9\. Aspirated the supernatant(s).

10\. Resuspended pellet(s) in   2  mL   growth   media    time

11\. Aliquoted   10 uL  of resuspended cells into a microcentrifuge tube for
cell count.

12\. Performed a cell count using the haemocytometer and recorded the cell
count data in the Google Doc spreadsheet called 'Cell Count Spreadsheet' (see
link below):

SSIBtIylyrBQE5kRX5Z8NtI/edit#gid=0

  1. Total cell number was:     464,000      

  2. Volume of cell suspension required for subculture was:    total aka 1 mL      

  3. Cell density per vessel:    7,000/cm2     




13\. Transferred    1000 µl of cell suspension to the pre-warmed     12  mL
Growth media:  11:23  

14\. Transferred cell suspension into     T75   vessel.

15\. Left at RT in the BSC for 30 min to allow cells to settle     time  

16\. Transferred vessel(s) to incubate at: time  

  * [ x]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (avian cells)
