### Process:

1\. Took image of vessel with microscope on phase setting.

2\. Aliquotted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then
placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath for a minimum of 20 minutes
prior to use:

  1. TrypLE:     200    mL
  2.  dPBS (for neutralising):     200  mL
  3.  dPBS (for washing):     200  mL
  4. Growth media (for pellet resuspension):    10 mL

Time that all aliquots were placed in the water bath the warm before use
14:08  

Note: if aliquots were placed in water bath at different time, record the time
stamp for each individual solution.




4\. Removed vessel(s) from the incubator    14:20

5\. Washed the vessel(s) with dPBS (warmed).

6\. Added     200    mL tryple to each vessel/well and incubated at 30˚C.

  1. Start/Finish for TrypLE was     14:33-14:43   

7\. Neutralised with     200 mL     dPBS and combined cell suspension into a
12x 200 mL    tubes.

8\. Centrifuged at 650 x g for 5 min.

  1. Start/Finish time for centrifugation was   14:51   




9\. Aspirated the supernatant(s).

10\. Resuspended pellet(s) in     1   mL     Growth     media  

11\. Pooled resuspended cells into 1 50 mL centrifuge tube and topped up to 10
mL with media.

11\. Aliquoted    100 uL    of resuspended cells into a microcentrifuge tube
for cell count.

12\. Performed a cell count using the haemocytometer and recorded the cell
count data in the Google Doc spreadsheet: Cell Count Spreadsheet or cell count
widget below

  1. Total cell number was:      72,618,000       

  2. Volume of cell suspension required for banking was (7 cryovials with 10M cells each):           




Freezing cells:

1\. Prepared  10 mL freeze media (FBS + 10% DMSO)

Stored at 4ºC until use to keep chilled.

2\. Aliquot       mL of cell suspension (for total of 100M cells for 10x
cryovials)

3\. Centrifuged cells at 300 x g for 5 min.  15:30

Whilst centrifuge is spinning, prepared & printed vial labels, labelled
cryovials. (Note that passage number will be the same as the culture you
harvest from. The passage number will increase by 1 during the revive of a
vial.)




4\. Aspirate the supernantant

5\. Resuspended the pellet in 7.2 mL cryostor (chilled, to reduce DMSO
toxicity).

6\. Aliquotted | 1000 |µL into | 7 | x cryovials (already labelled).

7\. Tightened the lids & transfer the cryovials to a Mr. Frosty immediately
into the -80ºC freezer. 16:01

8\. Allow the cells to freeze for at least 18-24 hours before transferring to
Liquid Nitrogen storage.
