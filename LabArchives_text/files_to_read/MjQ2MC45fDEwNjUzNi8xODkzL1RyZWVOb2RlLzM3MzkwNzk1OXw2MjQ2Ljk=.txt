Media Top up In STR2000

Performed by: AK/SR/CB

Media Mix ID: 13146

  
Water added to tank at: 13:30  
Powder added to tank at: 14:17  
Sodium Bicarb added to tank at: 14:56  
Media started pumping into STR2000 at: 16:30 **  
Media finished pumping in at: 20:30

  * Mixing tank rinsed with 30L of water which was then discarded
  * Filled with 600L of water and put heat jacket on (55'C) to get temp as close to 37 as possible so it could be pumped into the STR2000 at a faster pace
  * Then powder added (without sodium bicarb) and mixed/recirculated for approx. 20min
  * After powder seemed to be dissolved well, sodium bicarb was added
  * Mixed/recirculated for another approx. 20-30min until all dissolved
  * Pumped into the STR2000 using a 20inch filter with the pump on 150rpm to begin with and then slowly increasing this as the media filled up. The media temperature was at 25'C when it first started to be pumped in.
    * The input temperature rose to about 41'C - 42'C initially. The pump was not increased until this dropped to below 40'C.

** We had a lot of issues trying to get the media to flow through the tubing
up to the STR2000. In the end the only configuration that worked was using the
big grey pump and positioning it very close to the mixing tank. Having the
line primed a bit also helped.
