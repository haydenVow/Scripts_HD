1\. DMEM/F12 + 20% FBS + 1X P/S

\- 850 ml/week (this does not consider the flasks that will be seeded after
harvesting the second lot of 4 x T175 flasks on Tuesdays as we do not know how
many spare cells we will have).

* Check concentration of P/S (I believe the way to calculate the amount needed is to have both volumes in the same units and then divide by 100).

3\. Hycell Cho media

  1. Gather the reagents that need to be weighed and weigh the required amount into different urine pots (don't forget to write down the ID of these to make the label once you have finished preparing the media).
    1.  Hycell Cho powder (25.40 g/L of prepared media. This needs to be dissolved in MilliQ water)
    2.  Sodium bicarbonate (2.2 g/L of the total amount of media (including KSR and other GFs that will be added fresh every time the media is used))
    3.  Poloxamer 188 (1.0 g/L of the total amount of media (including KSR and other GFs that will be added fresh every time the media is used))
  2. Put all the weighed ingredients in the BSC after wiping them down with ethanol, as well as 1% of ACA, 1% of glutamax and 1% of P/S (this percentage refers to the total volume of media including KSR and other GFs that will be added fresh every time the media is used).
  3. In a sterile filter unit, add the Hycell Cho solution. With a serological pipette take up some of this Hycell cho solution and dissolve the sodium bicarbonate before dispensing it into the sterile filter unit.
  4. Repeat the step for the poloxamer 188. It does not dissolve easily, so add a magnetic stirrer into the urine pot, remove it from the BSC, and leave it on the stirring plate for about 10 minutes. DO NOT TRY TO DISSOLVE IT IN MEDIA BY PIPETTING UP AND DOWN AS THE POWDER WILL GET STUCK INSIDE THE PIPETTE TIP.
  5. In the meantime, add the ACA, glutamax and P/S into the sterile filter unit in the BSC.
  6. Once the poloxamer is completely dissolved, wipe down the urine pot containing it and introduce it into the BSC. Add it to the sterile filter unit.
  7. Connect the pump to the sterile filter unit. This preparation will make up 80% of the total volume of media that is required. The remaining 20% (KSR and GFs will be added every time the media is used).
  8. Finish off the media preparation by printing off the label.
