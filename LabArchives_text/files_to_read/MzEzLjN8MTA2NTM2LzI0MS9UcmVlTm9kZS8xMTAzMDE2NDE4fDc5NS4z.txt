Static Observations (VitC 50ug/mL):  

24hrs after TGFb 10ng/mL + VitC 50ug/mL 48hrs after TGFb 10ng/mL + VitC
50ug/mL  
  

  * After only about 15 hrs the cells have formed sheets at the bottom of the flask , but not entirely lifted off yet.
  * After 20hrs static formed a sheet that completely lifted off flask and media looks very clear.
  * Some flasks had small fragments that did not quite pellet down. Some were lost when removing the supernatant with a 1000 uL pipette (even when doing this extremely slowly/carefully). This may have been because the spin was not fast enough to force the cell aggregate/sheet into a solid pellet. 
  * The pellets were moving slightly after bulk supernatant removal with a 50 mL serological pipette and all had a slightly textured top surface, not a flattened or smooth one. 
  * Small sections of the former shape could be seen and several folds of the layers could be made out in the top section of each pellet indicating a retention of the structure/shape from the E flask. 

  
  
  
  
  

  * Aggregates appear to be breaking up (not into smaller fragments, but almost like dissolving)
  * After spinning they produced one solid powdery looking pellet present - but the top was very runny (can see cells lifting off the top of pellet as removing supernatant)

  
  
  
  
  
Intermittent Shake Observations (VitC 50ug/mL):

24hrs after TGFb 10ng/mL + VitC 50ug/mL 48hrs after TGFb 10ng/mL + VitC
50ug/mL  
  

  * Mixture of small and large aggregates, kind of an in-between appearance between the static and continuous conditions.  

  
  
  
  

  * The larger aggregates present at 24Hrs appear to be breaking up and becoming smaller fragments
  * After spinning: multiple fragments of varying size were present in the pellet. Hard to extract supernatant without sucking up the smaller fragments.

  
  
  
Shaking (Continuous) Observations (VitC 50ug/mL):

24hrs after TGFb 10ng/mL + VitC 50ug/mL 48hrs after TGFb 10ng/mL + VitC
50ug/mL  
  

  * Constant shaking have formed tiny little balls that have strung together. Media still very cloudy though. 

  
  
  

  * Still cloudy with small aggregates
  * The supernatant looked cloudy after the spin (cell debris?) and like the static formed one solidy powdery looking pellet - but top was very running. The bottom of the pellet shows some appearance of the little aggregates formed in the E-flask.

  


  
  
Static Observations (VitC 5mg/mL):

24hrs after TGFb 10ng/mL + VitC 5mg/mL 48hrs after TGFb 10ng/mL + VitC 5mg/mL  
  
  * After 15hrs: The 5mg vit C static have formed sheets that are mostly lifted off.
  * After 20hrs: 5mg vit C static also formed sheet that completely lifted up.
  * Some flasks had small fragments that did not quite pellet down. Some were lost when removing the supernatant with a 1000 uL pipette (even when doing this extremely slowly/carefully). This may have been because the spin was not fast enough to force the cell aggregate/sheet into a solid pellet.

  * Constant shaking have also formed tiny balls that have NOT clumped together, and media is still very cloudy. The cells appear to aggregate from the top of the cell suspension on the side of the flasks.

  

  * Still cloudy with small aggregates
  * The supernatant looked cloudy after the spin (cell debris?) and like the static formed one solidy powdery looking pellet - but top was very running. The bottom of the pellet shows some appearance of the little aggregates formed in the E-flask.
