Passage 1 - Thaw XX vials into XX


# Procedure \- Thaw and Seed

### Note: Fibroblasts do NOT require Gelatin coated Flasks, and do NOT require
p38i.

1\. Place new seeding flasks into the 30'C incubator to pre-warm.

1\. Extract required growth media into aliquots as listed in the table below
and place into a heated 30'C water bath for at least 30 minutes or until
temperature is reached.

3\. Select the vial/s for thawing. Note the location of the vial in Liquid
Nitrogen(LN) Dewer.  
Path: Stockyard v1 > Frozen Cultures > Select Vial/s (Use highest number
first, ie 62of62)

4\. Obtain selected number of cryovial/s from LN Dewar and thaw in the 30'C
water bath on a foam floater for a maximum of 5 minutes.  
*NOTE: Ensure to wear PPE and work swiftly whilst performing this this task. Ensure to wear cryogloves and face shield when handling the liquid nitrogen dewar. Ask a Vowzer for help if required.

5\. Spray and wipe the cryovial and growth media thoroughly with 70% EtOH and
transfer into the Biohazard Safety Cabinet (BSC).

6\. Slowly add 500uL of growth media into the/each vial. This will produce a
total of 1mL cell suspension per vial.

7\. Resuspend the cells gently and transfer all contents from the vial to the
bottom of a 50mL falcon tube. *NOTE: Dispensing suspension of cells on the
sides of the tube will risk loss of cells in Step 11.

8\. Add an additional 500uL of growth media to each vial to collect remaining
cells and add into the centrifuge tube. A total of 1.5mL will be in each vial.

9\. Resuspend cells thoroughly and immediately extract 50uL into a
microcentrifuge tube.

10\. Perform cell count (Refer to VSOP-007) from collected sample and use the
Cell Counting Widget (below) to enter data.

11\. Place 2 mL of pre-warmed media into each of the selected wells of a 6
well plate.

12\. Determine amount of cell suspension volume required per well and pipette
directly into media in well. When completed gently agitate plate in a cross
wise fashion to evenly distribute cells around wells.  
12\. Transfer the pre-warmed flasks from the 30C incubator into the BSC.  
``

14\. Transfer and incubate overnight at 30C.
