progressing towards

AIM/PURPOSE: Cells did not adhere in a previous experiment due to lack of
attachment sites. In this study we aim to identify a suitable matrix for cells
to adhere and differentiate inside alginate hydrogels.

HYPOTHESIS: A combination of gel stiffness and ECM binding sites can provide
encapsulated cells with a suitable environment to promote adhesion and
differentiation.

RESULTS SUMMARY:

CONCLUSIONS:

The Hypothesis was not supported and no changes in protein expression were
achieved, cell adhesion still has to be improved before significant changes in
maturation can be expected.

  * The addition of ECM proteins to the alginate matrix does not enable cells to adhere and differentiate regardless of gel stiffness (1% vs 2%). 
  * Microscopy analysis after viability stain did not indicate cell adhesion and gels were hard to image due to lack of transparency and overwhelming cell numbers
  * The alginate sphere format allowed for direct comparison for protein values of different conditions due to the reproducible size of the samples. The included ECM did not majorly contribute to background total protein absorbance in a Bradford assay, but only a baseline myoblast protein content was measured in this study. 

NEXT STEPS:

  * To improve adhesion and subsequently maturation, we will need to include as an additional component to the alginate matrix: 
    * RGD peptides 
    * growth factors 
    * fibroblasts
