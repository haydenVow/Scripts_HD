Add supplements to media

  1. Aliquot 'basal media' mixes that were prepared on 15/11/21 (containing P/S, ACA, P188) into containers. This involves aliquotting the amount needed to make 65 mL total (for EPIC27984) or 47 mL (for EPIC28374) by using the sheet titled 'EPIC27984' on this spreadsheet: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/124elwh67VrPyq7zPMqVI_g3-NUiVigjjaF64dVxeZa0/edit?skip_itp2_check=true#gid=1517203146 (screenshots below).
  2. Add KSR and other supplement to create the appropriate media formulations.
  3. For EPIC27984, after supplements have been added, take an aliquot of 17.5 mL from each media into 50 mL tubes. The 17.5 mL aliquots will be used to perform feeds on OT2 for 50 mL shake tubes and 24 dwp.
  4. For EPIC27984 also aliquot 47 mL and 17.5 mL of D/F + 20% FBS + 1x P/S.




Media for EPIC28374




Warm media

Warm media at 37 degrees C ~12:30 - ~13:15  




Media change and sampling

  1. Using a serological pipette, aspirated media down to 5 mL for each tube.
  2. Added 15 mL of warm media to each tube.
  3. Resuspended cells and transferred cell suspensions from 50 mL tubes to their corresponding E125 flasks.
  4. Swirled flasks and took 100uL of sample from E125 flask to 96 well plate.




Staining

Prepared dead stain solution in amber/black centrifuge tube:  
\- 4 mL dPBS  
\- 4 drops Nucgreen AF488 dead stain  
\- Vortex for 5 seconds to mix

Prepared Hoechst stain (50 ug/mL) solution in amber/black centrifuge tube:  
\- 9500 uL MilliQ  
\- 500 uL Hoechst Trihydrochloride trihydrate (1mg/mL)  
\- Vortex for 5 seconds to mix. Solution can be stored at 4Â°C for up to 6
months

  1. Added 20 uL of Hoechst stain directly to cells
  2.  Added 80 uL of dead stain solution (dPBS+Nucgreen) to cells
  3. Incubated for 30 minutes in the dark at room temperature  ~14:55 - 15:25
  4. Made 4x, 8x and 16x dilutions of the sample in dPBS 
  5. Centrifuged plates at 650 RCF for 1 minute  15:30  
  

  6. Prepared plate map:  
\- Created a new "MIA output" data workbook by copying the template at the
following link:
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Lf5u2kRGQLab1QzT75ve2nrPrSJiAoWFonpeS58bS4s/edit?usp=sharing  
\- Filled in each of the sheets according to how the samples were arranged  
\- Pasted the link to the "MIA output" workbook here:

Sytox: s3626

PBS: a7969

Hoechst: m8157 that was diluted to 50ug/mL was used




## Imaging

  1. Configure the Zaber session to image the entirety of each well; for 96 well plates this requires a 3 x 3 stitched image.
  2. Take images of each well on the blue fluroescence ("DAPI") and green fluorescence ("AF488") channels.

EPIC28374 imaging: 15:52, culture ID 9346

EPIC27984 imaging: culture ID 9345, time not recorded




## Analysis

  1. Analyzed the blue- and green-channel images using the DAPI and AF488 MIA macros respectively.
  2. Downloaded and extracted the data then pasted it into the "MIA output" data workbook created in the "Staining" section.
  3. Copied the data from the "Final output" sheet of the "MIA output" data workbook to the "Master Cell Counting Sheet" of the "Suspension culture counting spreadsheet": https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1YuTvXJXQQMIMwRZGeqNjdi20WeURg5FpM-1TJ-zrb1c/edit?usp=sharing




Observations/Summary:

on 22/11/21 all 24 dwp and 50 mL shake tube were moved to 30 degree incubators
to make space on shakers and incubators for other experiments. This means that
DOLLY cells in these vessels were also at 30 degrees even though they are
normally grown at 37 degrees C.

  

125 shake flask feed observations:

\- the 8G treatment causes clumping and nugget formation, compared to the 6G
and 106 treatments which didn't have any macroscopic clumping

\- 5.2 (the second hycell cho replicate) had significant clumping and worm
formation, and only ~15mL of media.  The other replicates exhibited no
macroscopic clumping and contained ~22mL of media.
