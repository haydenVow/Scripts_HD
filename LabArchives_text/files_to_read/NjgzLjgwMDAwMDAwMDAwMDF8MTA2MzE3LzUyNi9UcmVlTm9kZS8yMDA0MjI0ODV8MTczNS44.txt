## 1\. Background

Sodium selenite is commonly used as a source of selenium in biological
research, where selenium is an essential trace element that is normally
provided by serum.

  2. Sodium Selenite stock powder 
  3. Sterile falcon tubes 
  4. 1 x syringe filter unit 
  5. Steile microtubes 




## 6\. Method/Procedure (suitable for Sigma/Merck CAS# 10102-18-8)

Note: Please perform this procedure with the BSC light turned off. Growth
factors are often sensitive to light exposure.  

  1. Calculate the volume of dPBS buffer required to create a 0.1 mg/mL stock solution of Sodium Selenite.  
  2. Retrieve stock powder from storage location (Sodium Selenite powder is kept at -20 degrees C).
  3. Using a microfuge, centrifuge the vial containing Insulin powder for 30 seconds and then transfer the vial to the BSC.
  4. Using a micropipette, transfer dPBS from the falcon tube to the stock vial to reconstitute the powder to a concentration of 1.0 mg/mL. Pipette mix thoroughly and smoothly to dissolve the stock powder, taking care not to spill any of the solution. 
  5. Transfer the entire aliquot back to the falcon tube containing dPBS. Repeat steps 5 - 6 twice more to ensure that the entire amount of powder is dissolved in the dPBS. 
  6. Check the vial to ensure there is no powder left. If any powder remains, repeat step 8 until the vial is clean.
  7. Using a serological pipette, carefully mix the solution to ensure a homogenous mix.
  8. Pour or pipette solution into a syringe filter unit and filter into a new sterile falcon tube.
  9. Transfer the solution into sterile microtubes. Remember to add at least 5 uL to your desired aliquot volume to account for loss of liquid from pipetting. 
  10. Enter details in Stockyard V2 under "Create Mix".
  11. Place aliquots into an appropriately sized container (e.g. cryobox, 500 mL sterile pot) and stick Stockyard label on the container. Add a note of the volume per aliquot for future users. 
  12. Store in - 20 degrees C freezer.
