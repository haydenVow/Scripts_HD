Took samples

  1. Sprayed down the sample line end with 70% ethanol.
  2. Connected a 5 mL sterile syringe.
  3. Withdrew 1 mL (first-draw)
  4. Disconnected sample syringe and transferred 1 mL of sample each to 1.5 mL Eppendorf tubes for cell count
  5. Connected a fresh sterile syringe and withdrew 1 mL of sample (second-draw).
  6. Disconnected sample syringe and transferred 1 mL of sample each to 1.5 mL Eppendorf tubes for cell count
  7. Sprayed sample line with 70% ethanol.
  8. Performed cell count:
    * 1st draw: discarded
    * 2nd draw: 984 000 cells/mL (2 558 400 000 total)

### Observations/Summary:

  * Navigated to https://192.168.0.250/ from a web browser window
  * Logged into the Biostat web app using the details in the operating manual (see reference).
    1. Username: "admin" (all lower case)
    2. Password: "709aA0"

  

  * stirring speed: 119
  * pH: 7.40
  * dissolved oxygen: 2.4%
  * temperature: 37

Approximate cell count after seeding 50L RM bag:

~400 mL (left) / 2400 mL (original) * 2.2848B = 380.8M

Change in cell count:

380.8M -> 739.2M -> 1.651B -> 2.56B

  

Absorbance / Optical Density / Turbidity:

Volume used = 100 uL per well  

  * 3 reps of a blank (milliQ / dPBS)
  * 3 rep of draw 1
  * 3 reps of draw 2

Draw & Fill

  1. Harvested 2.0L from Mobius
    * 25mL + 175 newly prepared media into E500 for Tom (analyses)
    * remainder centrifuged and harvested. 225mL bottles centrifuged 10min at 310xg
  2. For harvest, rinsed 225mL bottles with 5mL PBS each and moved cell suspension into single bottle
  3. Counted cells from PBS cell suspension recorded in cell counting spreadsheet (7/3/22)
    * ~2.3B cells in 78mL
  4. Weighed pellet
    * weighed empty bottle to tare
    * difference in weight = 9.66g total harvest wet weight
  5. Stored pellet at -20degC
  6. Filled Mobius with newly prepared media +1600mL final volume ~2L
  7. New cell density = 196 800 cells/mL
