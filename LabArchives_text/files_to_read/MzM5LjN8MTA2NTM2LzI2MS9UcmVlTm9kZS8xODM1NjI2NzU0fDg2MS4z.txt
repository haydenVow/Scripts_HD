    2. Does this influence the final biomass/cm2?
  2. Does gelatin coating help cells stick down for longer?
    1. Does this coating increase the final biomass weight?

Reasons for Investigating these Questions:

All were done with the purpose of improve cell attachment and cell yield.

Experimental Timeline/Overview:

  

Experimental Deviations: (Original Plan Above)

Amended Plan  
  
Change of end point: (D1-D13) Don't harvest all flasks/groups at once, only
harvest each experimental group (3xT175) when 2/3 of the flasks in the group
begin to peel.  
50% Feed performed every 72hrs  
Change in experimental condition: (D13- D16) After 13 days of no peeling,
2xT175 flasks in the gelatin coated, collagen coated and control groups were
treated with VitC (50ug/mL) and harvest once peeling occurred (For collagen
coated VitC treated & control, and the 2 remaining controls (gelatin coated &
no treatment control) peeling never occurred and it was decided to terminate
the experiment at D16. On this day all remaining flasks were harvested)

Experimental Outcomes:

Seeding with VitC (50ug/mL):

  * 1/3 flasks began to peel @ D8 
  * 2/3 flasks began to peel @ D9, so were harvested of this day
    * Both peeled off from the edged and rolled into the centre. The cells in the centre of the circle were still adhered and 100% confluent. These aggregates were released from the flask with TrypLE and stayed together.
    * Although flask 3 did not peel, it still formed a cell sheet that came off in one piece after TrypLE treatment 
  * Observation: It tends to be the flask on the bottom, touching the shelving that begins to peel first for this condition. Maybe the direct heat makes a difference?

Collagen Coating:

  * After still no peeling had occurred @D14, 2xT175 flasks were treated with VitC (50ug/mL) the third T175 flask was left untreated
  * @D17 no peeling had occured in both the VitC treated (2xT175) and control (1xT175) flasks. Regardless these flasks were harvest at this time point because of a lack of benefit to keep them going. 
  * TrypLE was ineffective at lifting off cells from flasks coated in collagen. 
    * The untreated flask had some cells lift off. Upon collection of these cells, the mechanical force using a strippette to wash the surface was enough to 'blast' of the cells from the surface. 
    * However, the Vit C treated collagen flasks did not lift at all using TrypLE. Hence, the TrypLE was collect into the pre-weight falcon tube, 10mL of dPBS added to these flasks and then a scrapper used to take off the cells. It was very clear to see when the cells were scrapped off as they stuck together in a gelatinous (snotty) form. There was also areas that were unreachable with the scraper (the curved corners at the top of the flask) and was very clear to see the cells still adhered to those areas (pictures below).

Overall Results and Answers to Experimental Questions:

Average pellet weights from all conditions:

  

  * Seeded with VitC 50ug/mL and 5mg/mL groups both display an average of n=3 pellet weights
  * Gelatin coated, collagen coated, and control groups that were treated with VitC @D14 display an average of n=2 pellet weights per group
  * Gelatin coated, collagen coated, and control groups (no treatment/control) display one pellet weight each (n=1).
  * Error bars display SD

  

Amount of time in incubation before peeling was observed:  

  * Graph displays the number of days cells were incubated before peeling/aggregate formation occurred. This is the day the FIRST sign of peeling were observed, not the day these flasks were harvested. 
  * All remaining groups were harvested at D17, therefore, any groups that reach D17 can be considered to last for 16+ days as there were still no signs of peeling in these conditions at the time of harvest.

  

Experimental Questions:

  

1\. Does seeding with VitC allow cells to stick down for longer?

T175 flasks seeded with VitC (50ug/mL) began to peel at D8. This is a very
similar timeline to that seen previously (Batch 14) where 10CS flasks were
treated with VitC (50ug/mL) after 7 days of proliferation which began to peel
2 days after treatment (Total number of days = 9 days). So seeding with VitC
in this case did not make cells stick down for longer.

                        1\. Is 50ug/mL or 5mg/mL VitC better? 

                            Whilst seeding with 5mg/mL VitC allowed the cells to stick down for longer (12 days) compared to 50ug/mL VitC (8 days) the final weight of the cell pellets were very similar (50ug/mL average pellet weight = 0.222g, 5mg/mL                                             average pellet weight = 0.225g). As an increase in final pellet weight is of the greatest importance to production currently, 5mg/mL VitC shows no benefit over 50ug/mL, therefore, 50ug/mL VitC should be the                                                                      concentration used in all future treatments.

                        2\. Does this influence the final biomass/cm2?

                            As stated above there is no difference in the final biomass weight between VitC concentrations, however, the weight produced by both concentrations is more than all other conditions which were grown for a longer amount of                                          time. The weight cannot be compared to experiments in the previous batch (Batch 14) due to the large variation in vessel size (10CS compared to T175). Smaller vessels like T175s historically give inflated pellet weights                                                   that cannot be extrapolated to a 10CS. This is likely due to the very small pellets produced by T175s and influence residual liquid would have on this result (Liquid caught in a small pellet from a T175 would have a                                                              much bigger effect on weight, compared to a much larger pellet from a 10CS).

2\. Does gelatin coating help cells stick down for longer?

Compared to controls, no. However cells did stick down for longer when
compared to VitC Seeded conditions. At D13 Gelatin coated flasks were also
treated with VitC (50ug/mL) and they peeled after 24hrs of treatment.
Therefore gelatin does not help cells stick down for longer once VitC is added

                        1\. Does this coating increase the final biomass weight?

                           Cell pellets from Gelatin coated flasks (both control and VitC treated) were very different from controls 

3\. Does Collagen coating help cells stick down for longer?

Compared to controls, no. However cells did stick down for longer when
compared to VitC Seeded conditions. At D13 Collagen coated flasks were also
treated with VitC (50ug/mL) and they peeled after 24hrs of treatment.
Therefore collagen does not help cells stick down for longer once VitC is
added

                        1\. Does this coating increase the final biomass weight?  

                             Whilst the untreated Collagen coated flask was similar to control flasks, the VitC treated flasks produced larger pellets, however, it is unclear is this is due to cell/bio mass or added weight from the collagen coating itself as the                                       cells could not be dissociated from this coating. 

  

Overall Key Findings & Achievements:

  * 5mg/mL VitC shows no benefit compared to 50ug/mL VitC. Although 5mg/mL stuck down for longer, this did not result in a high yeild. Therefore 50ug/mL VitC should be the concentration of choice in future batches
  * VitC peeling seems to be at least partially dependent on cell confluence (High confluence = peeling/aggregate formation with VitC treatment).
    * Flasks seeded with 50ug/mL VitC peeled/aggregated at 8 days, this exact timeline was also seen in a roller bottle seeded with 50ug/mL VitC in Batch 15. 
    * When gelatin coated, collagen coated, and control flasks were treated with VitC, peeling/aggregation occurred only 24hrs after treatment (much faster than usual), again likely due to the very high cell confluence in these flasks which had already been growing for 13 days. Previously when treating 10CS with VitC a few days after reaching confluence peeling/aggregation occurs 2-4 days after treatment. These T175 flasks were treated 8 days after reaching 100% confluence.  
  * Extended time stuck down in culture, after reaching 100% confluence, without some kind of treatment does not equal more cell growth. See Gelatin coated and control (no treatment) data compared to VitC treated flasks in these conditions. 
  * Seeding in VitC does not effect cell adhesion or growth and can increase pellet weight relative to no treatment.

  

Future Directions:

  * Investigate the weight of collagen coating alone, to see how much of the pellet weight it due to the collagen coating and how much is due to cell mass/biomass.
