Experiment Plan

We will seed four moulds with 9 tissues each at a cell density of 40 million
cells per mL (finding of current max density with "well-formed" tissues from
experiment 4). Tissues will be cultured for 5 days in Pen/Strep, changed to
P/S free media for 2 days and harvested after 7 days. Tissues will be used for
immunoanalysis, flow cytometry, molecular analysis and product testing.

Scaffold mounting, sterilisation and coating

  1. Autoclaved moulds should be placed into the hood with: 15cm dishes, molten agar, mould weights, forceps (DONE)
  2.  ~~Place mould into 15cm dish and put sterile weight on top (DONE)  ~~
  3.  ~~Surround outer edge with 2% agar and leave to set and seal the mould in place.  ~~ ~~PDMS spin coat the mould to the plate.  ~~Do not need to be spin coated with PDMS as these scaffolds have a base. 
  4. Place the moulds in a bath of EtOH overnight (day before experiment) (DONE)
  5. Dry the plates upside-down along the bevel of the BSC to allow aeration, (morning of experiment) for 30-60 minutes   09 :15

  7. Pre-coat with 0.25% Pluronic solution for 1 hour (to prevent adhesion), start     11: 45 


Cell Supply Harvest and Matrix Formation for Seeding


## Preparation for Harvest

    1. Completed calculations can be found here
  2. Media preparation for harvest and seeding: 1100mL of PRF DMEM/F12 + P/S + Glutamax (1:100) + 1:1000 IGF1 (1mL/L) and 1:5000 EGF (200uL/L) +  1.5:1000  LAA2P/Vit C (150ug/mL)

## Cell Harvest for Mould seeding - Nuvonis suspension protocol

  1. Harvest cells with Cell Supply passaging protocol
  2. Count cells with haemocytometer/Vicell for total yields:
  3.   
Ranger Culture ID#13015  (VICELL COUNT)#13016 (when harvesting from multiple
vessels)  
Flask TypeE5000E5000  
Total Flask Yield 4,980 M4,965 M  
Total Volume taken1500259  
Cell Concentration (cells/mL) 3.32 M 3.31 M  
  4. Aliquot required cell suspension volume into 1x falcon tube: 
    1. 1500 mL  # 13015  

    2. 250 mL  # 13016
  5. Centrifuge at 500g for 5 minutes: start  12:40 
  6. Resuspend in 150mL across 3x  50mL Falcon tubes. Centrifuge at 300g for 5 minutes: start  13:05 
  7. Resuspend in 150mL across 3x  50mL Falcon tubes. Centrifuge at 500g for 5 minutes: start  
  8. Resuspend pellets in the growth media in the following volumes. 
    1. 40 M/mL = 1.44 Bn cells (for 9x tissues exactly), and 5.76 Bn for (9 tissues x 4 scaffolds = 36 tissues) = 69.696mL and resuspend really well. 
    2. Then aliquot 17.424 mL into 4x Falcon Tubes. 
  9. Bring out matrix additives from the fridge and proceed to matrix additions below.  
    1.  ~~Bring out ice box from the -80 freezer.  ~~

  

## Matrix formation for scaffold seeding -

N.B. Repeat this gel formation for each falcon tube at the same time - i.e.
Add Collagen to all, then add DMEM to all etc. - BUT be sure to move quickly!
Refer to Figure 2 to visualise the workflow.

1. Remove pluronic from the wells.

Condition: 40M cells/mL (n=9) per condition (mL)  
Step 1. Aliquot cells+media for 1 condition  
(n=9 tissues)17.424  
 Step 2. Add total Collagen (mL)14.616  
Step 3. Add total 10xDMEM/F12  
  
(mL)1.764  
Step 4. Add total 0.2M NaOH  
(mL)2.196  
Step 5. Pipette matrix into each well  
(mL)4  
  
2\. Add Collagen I (Devro: final concentration 2.6mg/ml) and mix well with
stripette (not resuspending!):

3\. Add 10xDMEM/F12 and mix with stripette.

4\. Add 0.2M Sodium Hydroxide and mix with stripette:

5\. Seed    4mL    gel/matrix gently into scaffold ensuring good distribution
around pillars in the well. Repeat for each treatment condition plate.

6. Leave for    60-90    minutes to gel at 37°C - start time

  * Plate 1: 14:45
  * Plate 2: 14:56
  * Plate 3: 15:11
  * Plate 4: 15:25

7\. Add   ~150-200mL   50-50 Media, ensuring entire mould is covered.

8. Culture at 37°C overnight before checking.

# Tips and Tricks for this Protocol:

  * When pelleting cells, make sure they are completely dry
  * Flick pellet to dislodge before adding medium
  * Add Medium first to pellet to prevent clumping and cell death
  * Col1 is very viscous, pipette carefully - when adding 10x DMEM, it turns yellow
  * As soon as you add the NaOH, be quick as the Col starts to gel
  * Everything has to be exact, don't be tempted to add more cells than the volume stated if there are some left
  * Add cells slowly!




Notes

  * Volumetrically, 6Bn cells centrifuged at 500g for 5min, then recentrifuged at 300g for 5mins takes up 40mL 
  * 25mL after centrifuging at 500g for 5min (3rd centrifuge)
