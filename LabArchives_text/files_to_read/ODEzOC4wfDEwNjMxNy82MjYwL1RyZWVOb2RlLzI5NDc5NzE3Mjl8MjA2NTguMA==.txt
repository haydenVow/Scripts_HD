AIM/PURPOSE  
The overarching goal of all new biopsies is to expand the Vows existing cell
library to include a broader range of species and cell types. Here, we will
isolate cells derived from Bob-White and Japanese Quail embryonic tissue and
expand them in planar culture to form master cell banks for each species. We
will also attempt to expand these cells in animal component free (ACF) medias.  

Note: Additional arms of this project will involve trialling the direct
adaption of quail embryonic cells to suspension culture, as well as adaption
to suspension following prior expansion in ACF planar culture.

See lab books here.

HYPOTHESIS

1\. Immediately post isolation, populations of cells derived from Day 9
Japanese Quail and/or Bob-White Quail embryonic tissue will survive and
proliferate in adherent culture in one or more of the following culture
medias.

  * DMEM/F12 + 10% FBS
  * DMEM/F12 + 5% FBS
  * DMEM/F12 + 10% KSR
  * OptiPRO + 4mM Glutamax

2\. After a 7 day period of culture in DMEM/F12 + 10% FBS, cells derived from
Day 9 Japanese Quail and/or Bob-White Quail will be able to survive and
proliferate in one or more of the following medias, when they are gradually
weened from DMEM/F12 + 10% FBS over 5-7 passages.

  * DMEM/F12 + 5% FBS
  * DMEM/F12 + 10% KSR
  * OptiPRO + 4mM Glutamax
