Aim/Purpose: To achieve adaptation of adherent cells to suspension
Hypothesis: Using media with low calcium and magnesium will help facilitate adaptation to suspension.
Technical Gap: We have not yet trialed using D/F without calcium and magnesium to adapt cells to suspension. We have also not really considered the effects of osmolarity on our cells within suspension medias.
Method/Procedure


D0: Seed cells to suspension culture in 50mL bioreactor tubes.  
F_DOLLY12 cells should be seeded into culture vessels at 1M cells/mL, directly
from WCB vials.  
  
50mL tubes - 5 conditions  
5ml of each of the basal medias below supplemented with 2% FBS + 10% Knockout
serum replacement + 1:100 anti-clumping agent + 0.1% pluronic + 100ng/mL each
FGF, IGF1, PDGF.

1\. DMEM/F12  
2\. DMEM/F12 without calcium and magnesium  
3\. RPMI

4\. D/F BOOST

5\. DMEM/F12 without calcium and magnesium BOOST

6\. RPMI BOOST

RPMI or D/F boost media:  
Basal media with the following additives:

  1. 1:100 Trace Elements B
  2. 1:100 Trace Elements C
  3. 1:100 RPMI Vitamin mix
  4. 1:50 MEM essential amino acids mix
  5. 1:50 MEM non-essential amino acids mix

  
  
D4, D8, D12, D16, D20, D24, D28  
Perform 100% media changes every 4 days by centrifuging the cell suspensions
at 300xg for 5 minutes, discarding the supernatant and resuspending cells in
their respective growth medias.

D14, D16, D18, D20, D22, D24, D26, D28, D30  
After cells have been in suspension for 2 weeks, begin sampling every 2 days
for live/dead staining and counting. Cell counts are performed by centrifuging
suspensions at 300xg for 5 min and then resuspending in 500ul. 20ul samples
are then taken for counting using a Hoechst/Propidium iodine staining
protocol. On non-feed days, medium can be retained and returned to cells after
the count. Ideally, this process will be completed using the newly developed
OT2 protocol.
