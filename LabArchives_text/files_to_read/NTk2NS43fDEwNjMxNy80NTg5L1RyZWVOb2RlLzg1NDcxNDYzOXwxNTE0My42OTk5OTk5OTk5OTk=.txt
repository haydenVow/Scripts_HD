## Turbocharging fast suspension adaptation is important for achieving KR1 and
KR4. It will enable us to test more conditions when performing fast adaptation
of cells to suspension. Furthermore, the same platform could be used for media
optimisation experiments once we have a suspension adapted cell line.

## KR1: Develop a QMS-compliant serum-free media that supports 20+ doublings
of our chosen species in suspension

KR4: Establish and run a suspension pipeline at a rate of 10,000 clones per
month.
