Process
  
  
  1. Aliquoted 60 mL of 50/50 medium and 60 mL of 75/25 medium. Placed in waterbath. 
    * Note: Please use M12650 and M12638 first because GFs were added to these earlier than the other mixes. 
  2. Took 1 x 510 uL sample from flask 
  3. Performed count using ViCell and recorded in table below 
  4. Added 2M cells from culture to 6 x 50 mL tubes (6 x 2M cell aliquots)
    * Note: this culture was seeded at 4M cells on Mon to account for the number of cells required today. If there are not 12M cells in the culture, seed at the max possible cell number per flask and record new cell seeding number
  5. Centrifuged at 500 x g for 5 min 
  6. Re-suspended in 20 mL of warmed 50/50 or 75/25 medium (3 cultures per condition)
  7. Transferred cell suspensions to new E-125s
  8. Returned cultures to incubate
