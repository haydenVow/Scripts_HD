Process


  1. Removed flasks from incubator 
  2. Took 1 x 550 uL samples from each E-flask
  3. Performed cell counts and averaged for each flask and each condition (recorded in table below)
  4. Aliquoted following volumes of media with growth factors and warmed in water bath.
    1. 40 mL RPMI suspension medium + 0.0005 mg/mL IGF \+ 0.0001 mg/mL EGF
  5. Transferred cultures to 2 x 50 mL tubes
  6. Centrifuged at 500 x g for 5 min
  7. Aspirated 100% of supernatant, resuspended cells in 40 mL of pre-prepared RPMI suspension medium 
  8. Split into 2 x 20 mL aliquots in 2 x E-125s (strained through 40 uL cell strainers)
  9. Added 266 uL of glucose (300 g/L) to 12184 ~~  
~~

  10. Returned cultures to incubate at 37 'C, 5% CO2, 120 RPM
