Process:

  1. Placed both DSD deep well media reservoirs in incubator for 15 minutes   10:40 am 
  2. Using a multichannel pipette, media was aspirated from each plate (changing tips for each column) and media was transferred from the corresponding columns of the respective deep well reservior to the respective plate. Block 1 media is for plate 1 and block 2 media is for plate 2. Each column of the media reservior corresponds to the destination column on the plate.
  3. Removed  100  % of supernatant from vessel. 
  4. Replaced with  140uL  (per well/per vessel) of  DSD   media. 
  5. Returned vessel to incubate at:

  * [X]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (aviary cells)

  

  * Incubator (Thermo), Lab [Main]
