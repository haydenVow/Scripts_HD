RELATED TO MILESTONE:  Milestone 1

AIM/PURPOSE: To construct an assembly with a culture surface area of >100 cm2
that is capable of keeping cells alive (on scaffolds) while also minimizing
manual maintenance (media changes)

HYPOTHESIS: Cells will experience a microenvironment similar to the currently
used 6-well plate sized vessels in a larger a container. Areas of concern are
gas diffusion in the larger media volume, sterility and unknown factors when
scaling the culture vessel.

RESULTS SUMMARY:

CONCLUSIONS: The investigated "big pot of media" style bioreactor is a
suitable vessel to incubate a large number of cell-laden scaffolds for
multiple days while minimizing operator interaction and freeing up technician
time.

NEXT STEPS: Hand off to production and start work on perfusion-based reactors
to further automate the maturation part of the production pipeline. Start
investigating effects of scale on cell maturation.
