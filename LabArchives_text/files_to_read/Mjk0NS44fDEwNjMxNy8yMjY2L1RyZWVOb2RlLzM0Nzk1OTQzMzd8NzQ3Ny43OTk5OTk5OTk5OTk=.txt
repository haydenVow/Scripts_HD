Process:

7268-DOLLY12-Sheep P9-3of3 is in Thermo incubator.

1 mL of each of these media is in the mini-fridge under bioreactor in 70mL
pots:

  1. commercial DMEM/F12 + 10% FBS
  2. in-house DMEM/F12 + 10% FBS (1/2)
  3. in-house DMEM/F12 + 10% FBS (2/2)

  

  1. Warm up the pre-aliquotted media by Placing it in the incubator. Time: 14:35
  2. Aspirate 50% (70uL/well) of the media from column 2, 3, and 4. Change tips between columns.
    1. Note: only 6 wells per column need a feed. Edge wells contain PBS only.
  3. Add 70uL/well of media as follows:
    1. column 2: commercial DMEM/F12 + 10% FBS
    2. column 3: in-house DMEM/F12 + 10% FBS (1/2)
    3. column 4: in-house DMEM/F12 + 10% FBS (2/2)
  4. Return plate to Thermo incubator.
