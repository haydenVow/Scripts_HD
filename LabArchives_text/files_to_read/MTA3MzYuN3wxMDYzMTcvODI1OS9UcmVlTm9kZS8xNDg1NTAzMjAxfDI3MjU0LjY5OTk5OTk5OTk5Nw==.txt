Cost per L of RPMI/CHO-in-1 media (before negotiations/scale cost reduction)

  * 0/100: US$16.50
  * 50/50: 8.25 + 1.36 = US$9.61
  * 75/25: 4.125 + 2.04 = US$6.165
  * 90/10: 1.65 + 2.448 = US$4.098




We have tested the maximum density we can achieve with Nuvonis cells in both
100% Freestyle and 100% HyCell Nuvonis suspension media. It was found that
"cells grown in Hycell CHO exhibited...a max concentration of 11.5M cells/mL.
The freestyle treatment displayed...a max concentration of 8.07M cells/mL."
(see EPIC report here).

Given cost and supply constraints, we have had to move out of Freestyle and
HyCell media for manufacturing and scale-up. The substitute high-density
medium we have chosen to replace these (until we can create our own) is CHO-
in-1 from HiMedia (see HD-media screening EPIC). This will then be diluted
with RPMI to further reduce costs (see cost breakdown in entry above).

The maximum cell density (cells/mL) that CHO-in-1 medium can support has thus
far not been tested. Given our goal is to maximise output (cell yield) per
cost of inputs (primarily growth media), we want to determine the maximum
density that different RPMI/CHO-in-1 ratios can achieve. This will inform the
optimal media formulation for maximising cells per $ which we will take
forward to manufacturing.
