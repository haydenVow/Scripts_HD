Dear [Speaker name]  

We have just started a monthly seminar series at Vow, where we invite external
speakers to come in talk about their research, scientific journey and what
they are passionate about.

The audience is mostly made up of the Vow science team, but we may also invite
attendees from nearby biotech companies to join us for the seminar.

We have no set dates at this stage, but are gauging interest. If you would be
happy to come and share your work we could figure out a time and date to suit
you.

  

Kind regards

[Vow organizer]

# Speaker Introduction Notes

Welcome to today's Vow Invited Speaker Series Talk by Dr. Karina Wright.

Dr. Wright is a Senior Lecturer in Orthopaedics

at the Robert Jones & Agnes Hunt Orthopaedic Hospital

at Oswestry/Keele University, UK

and she is joining us today to talk about her research using

"Large-Scale QuantumÂ® Expansion of cells for orthopedic therapies"

  

Dr Wright's research interests in Regenerative Medicine are in understanding
the biology of cartilage and bone injury and osteoarthritis. She is also
developing clinical diagnostic and predictive tests for the assignment of
cartilage bone and spinal cord injury treatments. Finally, Dr. Wright is using
bioreactors to develop novel cell based therapies for the treatment of
musculoskeletal injury and diseases.

Dr Wright kindly agreed for this talk to be recorded so Vowzers who have kids
to pick up or conflicting meetings can revisit the slides at a later time. Dr
Wright had a great chat with Soroush earlier in the year and gave a wonderful
reference for our soon-to-join Senior Scientist Dr James Henstock, also on the
call from the UK.

Please feel free to stick around after the talk to have a chat with either.

About 5 min from the 30 minute mark, I`ll raise my hand to indicate timing and
with that being said, let`s jump right into the science...
