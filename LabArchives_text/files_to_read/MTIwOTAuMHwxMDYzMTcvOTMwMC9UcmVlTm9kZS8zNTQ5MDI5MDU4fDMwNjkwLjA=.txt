AIM/PURPOSE:

To achieve:

  1. 1-tonne of cultured meat harvested by the end of 2022, and
  2. in-house manufacturing first product 'Morsel' as a saleable product

we have identified that we must be able to routinely achieve a 30g/L wet-
weight harvest of Nuvonis cells in bioreactors by 30 September 2022. We aim to
do this by modifying our current in-house medium formulation to support high-
density growth. Based on previous data, we assume that 7.5M cells/mL will
yield 30g/L.

to quantify metabolites glucose, L-glutamine, ammonia, and lactate in spent
media using absorbance-based commercial kits. We will measure Nuvonis cell
culture metabolite profiles over time from initial seeding to
stationary/death-phase, and compare how these profiles differ between
different medium formulations.  

HYPOTHESIS: we propose that metabolite profiles will differ between mediums
where:

  1. 1) some metabolites will be consumed and thus depleted in spent media, and 
  2. 2) some metabolites will accumulate as a waste byproduct and thus increase in spent media

From these data, we aim to:

  1. 1) resolve favourable metabolite profiles in positive controls
  2. 2) resolve metabolite profiles for our current in-house media formulation
  3. 3) determine how to modulate our current in-house media formulation to generate a favourable metabolite profile by adjusting metabolites in either media starting formulation or through scheduled feeding
