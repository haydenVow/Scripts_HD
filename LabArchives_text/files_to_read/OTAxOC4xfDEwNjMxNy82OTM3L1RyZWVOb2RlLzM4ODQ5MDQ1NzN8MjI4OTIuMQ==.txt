Process:

  1. Aliquotted  6 mL of  DMEM-ITS-Chir-Ldn media and 6 mL E6 
  2. Placed in water bath  at 37C  
  3. Removed   100 % of supernatant (500 uL) from vessel
  4. Replaced with   500 uL mL (per well/per vessel) of  differentiation  media. 
  5. Imaged plates at 10x using phase microscopy
  6. Returned vessel to incubate at: 13:24
