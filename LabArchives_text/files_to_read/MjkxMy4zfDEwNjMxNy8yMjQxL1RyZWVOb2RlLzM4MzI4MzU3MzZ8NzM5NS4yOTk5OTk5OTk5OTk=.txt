RELATED TO MILESTONE:  KR2- Generate >1500 clones per month starting Sept 1st

AIM/PURPOSE: To determine the effect of Hoechst in FACS sorting on cell
selection, to determine the effect of conditioned media on cells in 384-well
plate and to determine the required length of time before expansion into
96-well plates.

HYPOTHESIS: That staining the cells with Hoechst either has a positive or
negative effect on cell selection during FACS (for favourable cells), and that
conditioned media will allow more cell colonies to proliferate from the
starting point of 1 cell. We also hypothesise that this clonnig run will
provide iinvaluable information about the confluence that can be reached in a
384-well plate, and indicate the most effective time to expand cells beyond
384-well stage.

RESULTS SUMMARY: See report

CONCLUSIONS: Our findings around our hypothesis were inconclusive due to cell
counting discrepencies with our ML model.  However, 2 x clonal cell lines from
the F_DOLLY12 cell line were able to achieve >40 total cell doublings (from
initial biopsy isolation). This surpassed the natural hayflick limit and
suggests the cells may be immortal or may demonstrate greater longevity than
most mammalian cell lines.

NEXT STEPS:

\- increase ML model cell counting accuracy

\- repeat experiment using optimized ML model or staining method for accurate
cell counts

see report for more detailed future directions
