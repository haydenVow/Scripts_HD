  1. Magnesium
    * "Magnesium is indispensable to life, as this micronutrient is involved in many important biological processes. Magnesium has multiple functions in all cellular processes, including DNA replication and protein synthesis, and also serves as a cofactor for DNA-repair proteins and in the maintenance of a cell's redox status, cell-cycle regulation, and apoptosis [29]. Magnesium deficiency or the displacement of Mg2+ by other toxic, divalent metal ions leads to increased genomic instability, which has been implicated in many diseases [115] and may result in inhibited DNA repair, oxidative stress, accelerated ageing, and increased cancer risk [29, 116]."
