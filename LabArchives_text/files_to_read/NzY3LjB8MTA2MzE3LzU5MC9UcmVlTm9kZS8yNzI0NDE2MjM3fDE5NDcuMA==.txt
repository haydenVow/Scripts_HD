AIM/PURPOSE: To develop a reliable method for the assessment of Muscle
maturation, e.g. by measuring protein content increase and type

HYPOTHESIS: We can reliably measure protein content of cells adhered to
scaffolds and achieve a measurable increase by using maturation factors to
increase protein content from the baseline. Scaffold materials do not
contribute to the protein level measurement (otherwise any cell-derived
maturation would be obscured in the noise)

RESULTS SUMMARY:

CONCLUSIONS:

NEXT STEPS:

  







can we use Derek`s macro to also count cells and validate JG stain results?
