Process
  
  
*Note: Flasks have been labelled with numbers 1-36 in order to make the labelling of ViCell and 15mL tubes quicker.  
  
         Outside the BSC

  1. Took 2 x 0.5mL aliquot from each of the 36 x E125 using a 1mL micropipette and deposited 0.5mL in 1 x ViCell tube and 0.5 mL in 1 x 1.5mL eppendorf tube each.  

  2. Performed counts on ViCell and recorded counts in media results G-sheet.
  3. While counts are being performed, performed pH reading on the remaining volume in the flask, and recorded measurements in the media results G-sheet.
  4. Centrifuged 36 x 1.5 mL tube at 1000xg for 1 minute.
  5. Aspirated 250uL of supernatant and deposited in new tube containing 250 uL milli-q, having a total of 36 x 1.5mL tubes.  

  6. Placed in the -20'C freezer in Main Lab (#184) in a plastic box labeled "Biochem analyses for BIF'.
  7. Enter the details of your samples in this G-sheet. Please try to ensure the order of the samples in the box match the order in the spreadsheet.
