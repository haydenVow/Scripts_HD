## Performed by: LL  




Reagent preparation:

1\. Prepared   2 mL  PBST (0.2% Triton-X)

2\. Prepared   2 mL  blocking buffer: PBST (0.1% Triton-X + PBS) + 3% bovine
serum albumin (BSA). (Kept in the fridge until needed in blocking step)

3\. Prepared Primary Antibody Mix: :   10 µL   Primary #1 MyoG (Santa Cruz)
(1:200) +   40 µL   Primary #2 MF20 (DSHB) (1:50) +   1950 uL  Blocking Buffer

Pipette-mixed antibody mix and stored refrigerated away from light until
needed.

Process:

Permeabilise

  1. Aspirated dPBS. Added 200 uL/well of PBST and incubated for 15 min. Timestamp: 9:34 - 9:52




Blocking

1\. Added  200 µL of blocking buffer (3% BSA in PBST [0.1% Triton-X]) and
incubate for 45 minutes:   9:54 - 10:39  




Single/Simultaneous Primary Antibody staining

1\. Removed blocking buffer from each well.

2\. Incubated cells with primary antibody for 90min at RT:  10:41 - 12:13  

After this step, all further task should be performed in a dark room. The
vessel should also be wrapped foil when not used.
