### Process:

3\. Aliquotted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then
placed all aliquots to bead bath at 37 degrees  

  1. Growth media (for seeding):     60    mL 




  

5\. Washed the vessel(s) with 5mL dPBS (room temp)

6\. Discarded washes then added    5     mL tryple to each vessel/well and
incubated at 30˚C, 5% CO2 for 10 minutes.  

7\. Neutralised with     5     dPBS and combined cell suspension into a
50mL    tube.

  




  

11\. Aliquoted     20uL     of resuspended cells into a microcentrifuge tube
for cell count.

12\. Performed a cell count using the haemocytometer and recorded the cell
count data in the Google Doc spreadsheet: Cell Count Spreadsheet or cell count
widget below

SSIBtIylyrBQE5kRX5Z8NtI/edit#gid=0&range=3731:3731

  1. Total cell number was:     19,200,000      (3,840,000 cells/T75flask)   

  2. Volume of cell suspension required for subculture was:      5.208mL (2million cells)       

  3. Cell density per vessel:    5714 cells/cm^2        




13\. Transferred      5.208     mL of cell suspension to the pre-warmed
60     mL Growth media:  

14\. Transferred cell suspension into 2xT175 flasks (30mL each)  

16\. Transferred vessel(s) to incubate at:

  * [x]  30ºC, 5% CO2 (CHOMP cells)




Observations/Summary:

flasks were 100% confluent when inspected down the microscope prior to passage
(under 10x objective, PHASE)
