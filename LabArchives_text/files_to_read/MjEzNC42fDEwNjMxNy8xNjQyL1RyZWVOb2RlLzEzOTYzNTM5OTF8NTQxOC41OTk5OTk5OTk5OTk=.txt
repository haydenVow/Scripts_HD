## Performed by: LL  




Growth Media:

  * [x]  DMEM + 10% FBS + 1X P/S
  * [x]  DMEM/F12 + 20% FBS + 1X P/S + P38i (10uM)

Total DMEM + 10% FBS + 1X P/S required: 1.5 mL

Total DMEM/F12 + 20% FBS + 1X P/S + P38i (10uM) required: 600 uL

Process:

1\. Aliquotted  1.5 mL  mL of  C2C12 Growth Media and   600 uL  mL of  DOLLY12
Growth Media into  2 x 15 mL    tube(s). Placed in water bath   : a/pm

2\. Removed  100 % of supernatant from 96-well plate.

3\. Replaced with  150  uL per well for planar culture wells and  230  uL per
scaffold

4\. Returned vessel to incubate at:

  * [x]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (aviary cells)

  

  * Incubator (#  ), Lab [Main/Library/Production]
