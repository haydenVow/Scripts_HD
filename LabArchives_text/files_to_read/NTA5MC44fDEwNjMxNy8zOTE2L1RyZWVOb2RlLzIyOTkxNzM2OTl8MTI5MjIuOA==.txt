Sample processing details  
Moved for processing by: Michael Medynskyj  
Time tissue was moved from 2-8C storage for extraction of biopsy piece: 10:51
am  
Process location: Vow (6 Ralph St) Cafe area (the culinary centre was being
used by Product team at the time and therefore was unavailable).  
Area prepared and cleaned prior to processing of the tissue by Michael
Medynskyj using 70% ethanol (x2 wipe-downs of all bench areas).

Number of tissue samples to be processed for biopsy pieces: 1 (weight of
tissue on vacuum sealed package = 0.824g)

Number of biopsies to be taken (total): 1

Purpose of biopsy pieces taken:

  1. Processing to see if we can still obtain viable cells (fibroblasts and/or myoblasts) from tissue that has been frozen (4-6 grams of the sample required for this purpose)
  2. Storage of whole tissue samples for OCT, genomics, proteomics, metabolomics etc. One piece for each analysis type listed here with an estimated size of 3mm x 3mm x 5mm (HWD)

NOTE: sample was still partially frozen upone extraction from the fridge, but
I was able to press in the tissue with my gloved hands through the vacuum
sealed packaging. I made the judgement that the tissue was probably soft
enough to attempt extraction of a sample.




  

Biopsies to be collected from the vaticus heads.






Process:

  1. Prepared for biopsy:

    1. Surgical drapes

    2. Iodine spray/solution
    3. 70% ethanol bottle

    4. Lab coats

    5. Gloves

    6. Sterile guaze 

    7. Sterile forceps

    8. Sterile scalpels 
    9. Sterile scissors 
    10. Hair clippers 
    11. Rediwipes 
    12. Permanent markers
    13. 50mL tubes stored in the fridge until use:
      1.  DMEM/F12 + 1% v/v P/S

      2. PBS + 1% v/v P/S

Details of animal biopsy harvest & transportation:

  1. Biopsies collected from the whole tissue sample at: 10:55 am

  2. Sprayed the surface of the leg with 70% ethanol, gently dab with sterile gauze.
  3. Poured iodine solution into sterile gauze and dabbed it over the surface of the leg. Left this on for 5 min  start = 11:10 am  Finish =11:15 am

  4. Gently dabbed away excess with sterile gauze

Process for collecting muscle biopsies:

  1. `First cut a square (not too deep) to remove the skin`

  2. Changed scalpels and tweezers (as the outer layer may be contaminated). Cut another square into the tissue (not too deep). Removed this - It will not be used as it may be contaminated.

  3. Changed scalpels and tweezers and take biopsies 

Process for collecting dermal biopsies:

  1. Using scalpels and tweezers, pull and cut away the thin outer white layer from the surface of the sample

  2. Placed each biopsy in a tube containing dPBS + 1x P/S. 

  3. Once all biopsies have been taken. Transferred biopsies to tubes containing DMEM/F12 + 1x P/S. Time this was performed: 11:42 am

  4. Transfer tubes containing biopsies to the lab 11:51 am (after clean-up of the sample taking area).

  5. Sample was placed into Library lab fridge ID# 104 at 11:59 am until the isolation process could begin.

  

NOTES:

The muscle group selected (highlighted in blue shading in the muscle diagrams
above) was significantly smaller than expected in the tissue sample. I took as
much of the selected muscle group, or what I estimated to be the correct
muscle, as possible while also taking care to avoid potentially contaminated
sections of the tissue near the knife-cut sections of the piece where it was
cut from the carcass at the time of slaughter.
