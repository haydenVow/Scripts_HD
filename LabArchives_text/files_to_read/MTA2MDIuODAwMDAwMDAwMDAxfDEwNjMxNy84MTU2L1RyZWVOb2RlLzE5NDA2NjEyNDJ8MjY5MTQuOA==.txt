NOTE: AMBR lab archives template has since been prepared and can be utilised
for next run.  




Sampling and offline measurements

  1. Labelled x4 50mL falcon tubes 1-4
  2. Followed on-screen prompt to sample bioreactors and recorded in run
  3. Sprayed sample line with EtOH and removed cap
  4. Unclipped clamp on sample line
  5. Opened disposable 5mL syringe with luer-lock and drew 1mL, deposited into 50mL tube. Discarded syringe
  6. Opened disposable 5mL syringe with luer-lock and drew 1mL, deposited 0.5mL into 1.5mL tube (for cell count) and deposited remainder into corresponding 50mL tube. Discarded syringe
  7. Clipped sample line and screwed on cap
  8. Repeated for each AMBR bioreactor vessel
  9. Counted cells using Nucleocounter as per manufacturer's instruction. Used 200uL sample volume per read. 
  10. Deposited remaining cell suspension from 1.5mL tube into corresponding 50mL falcon tube and used offline pH probe (Matteo Toledo) as per manufacturer's instruction and recorded
