Moved the sterile bioreactor vessel and bottles from the autoclave to near a
BSC

  1. Waited for the autoclaving chamber to cool to 60-70 deg C
  2. Opened the chamber and checked connections to make sure that all vessels remained sealed. In the event that any tubing popped off, rinsed the connections with 70% ethanol and reconnected; or, re-autoclaved the entire assembly.
  3. Placed the vessel and bottles on a trolley and moved the trolley next to a BSC.

NotesO rings on autoclaved schott bottles may be sticky, When fixing the
autoclaved bioreactor lids to the schott bottle ensure lid detaches easily.
otherwise transfer the contents of your innoculum to the autoclaved schott
bottle.  
  
  
  




Connected the liquid addition bottles to the bioreactor vessel

  1. Thoroughly wiped down the female STT connectors attached to the tubes that are attached to the bioreactor vessel.
  2. Placed the female STT connectors in the BSC.
  3. Removed the cap from a female STT connector with two hands
  4. While still holding the female STT connector in one hand, removed the cap from the male STT connector with one hand and connected the male and female parts together.
  5. Ensured that the correct male and female parts were connected.
  6. Unclamped all of the lines after everything was connected.
  7. Repeated the previous steps for all female/male STT connector pairs EXCEPT for the seed bottle.
  8. Removed the bottles from the BSC and placed on the trolley with the bioreactor vessel.
  9. Transferred the bottles and vessel to the bench next to the control tower.

NotesGenerally, bottles containing liquids going into the culture should be
connected to the multiport on the top of the reactor. Don't connect
microcarrier containing innoculum to the multiport, it will block the tube.
Instead, fill via the harvest tube  
  
  
  




Added the culture medium & microcarriers

  1. Fitted pump A to pump OUT of the line connected to the harvest dip tube.
  2. Clamped the harvest bottle line and unclamped the waste bottle line.
  3. Pumped out the waste liquid until bubbles emerged from the dip tube inside the waste bottle.
  4. Clamped the waste bottle line and unclamped the microcarrier/harvest bottle line.
  5. Reversed the pump direction to pump IN to the line connected to the harvest dip tube.
  6. Pumped in the fresh growth medium until bubble emerged from the harvest pipe inside the bioreactor vessel.
  7. Ensured that there was enough growth medium to completely submerge the impeller, sparger and probes, and enough to reach the bottom of the sample dip tube.
  8. Clamped the microcarrier/harvest bottle line
  9. Reversed pump A again to pump OUT of the line connected to the harvest dip tube.

    Fitted the liquid addition/removal lines into the peristaltic pumps

  1. Opened the peristaltic pump heads.
  2. Placed the tubing from each bottle in the respective persitaltic pump head.
  3. Ensured that the tubing was the correct way round as the pumps turn only in one direction.
  4. Closed the pump heads.
  5. Placed the feed bottle in the bar fridge under the bioreactor bench.

NotesAnti-foam and base lines should always go to anti-foam and base pump
respectively because they are automatically controlled.  
  
  
  




Primed the feed tubes

  1. Ran each persitaltic pump from the Biostat control software to fill the liquid addition tubes.
  2. Set the totaliser to 0 after priming all tubes.
    1. Priming the tubes and the setting the totalizer to 0 ensures that the control unit will record the correct volume of liquid during the run.

Fitted and connected the heating blanket

  1. Fitted the heating blanket around the lower portion of the glass vessel (tough side touching the glass and soft spongy side facing out).
  2. Ensured that the heating blanket was connected to the control tower.

out. Try not to cover the volume measurements on the side of the glass.  
  
  
  




Fitted and connected the exhaust heater

  1. Stretched the flaps of the heater over the exhaust filter (so that the filter is "sandwiched" between the tough flaps).
  2. Ensured that the heater was connected to the control tower.
