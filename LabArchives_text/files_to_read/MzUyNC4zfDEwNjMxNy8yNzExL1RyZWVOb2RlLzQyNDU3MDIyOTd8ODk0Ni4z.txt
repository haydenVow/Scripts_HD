Process:

1\. Aliquotted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then
placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath for a minimum of 20 minutes
prior to use:

  1. TrypLE:   200  mL 
  2. dPBS (for neutralising & washing)    400   mL 
  3. Growth media (for count):   5  mL 
  4. Growth media (for seeding): 10 mL for culture 1, 10 mL for culture 2
  5. Times that all aliquots were placed in the water bath to warm before use    10:01  am 

Note: if aliquots were placed in water bath at different times, record the
time stamp for each individual solution.




2\. Washed the flask(s) with dPBS.

3\. Added   100  mL tryple to each vessel/well and incubated at 37˚C for   13
min.

Note: Fibroblasts typically require 15-18 minutes of incubation with tryple,
slightly longer than MuSCs.

  1. Start/Finish time for centrifugation was    10:28    \-   10:41  am

4\. Neutralised with   100 mL   dPBS (warmed) and combined cell suspension

5\. Centrifuged at 650 x g for 5 min

  1. Start/Finish time for centrifugation was    10:50    \-    10:55    




6\. Aspirated the supernatant(s)

7\. Resuspended pellet(s) in   5 mL   growth   media.

8\. Performed a cell count using the haemocytometer and recorded the cell
count data in the Google Doc spreadsheet called 'Cell Count Spreadsheet' (see
link below):

SSIBtIylyrBQE5kRX5Z8NtI/edit#gid=0

9\. Total cell number was:     107,235,200  




10\. Seeded ~7k cells per cm2 of the flasks/plates. Note that fibroblasts
prefer to be subcultured closely together.

11\. Volume of cell suspension required for subculture was:   578 uL per 50 mL
shaker tube (10,000,000 cells per tube)  

12\. Transfer   578 µL of cell suspension to the pre-warmed  2 x 10 mL Growth
Media.

13\. Transfer cell suspension into    2 x 50 mL shaker tubes  

14\. Transfer flask/plate(s) to incubate at:

  * [x ]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (aviary cells)




Observations/Summary:

Passaged adherent NANDO_F (chicken fibroblasts) into suspension culture at 1
million cells per mL
