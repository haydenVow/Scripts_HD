1) Moved E-flask cultures to 2 x 50 mL tubes

2) Took 1 x 100 uL samples from each E-flask culture for staining wash test

3) Centrifuged 4 x 50 mL tubes at 300 x g for 5 minutes 12:10 - 12:15

4) Aspirated 100% of supernatant from all cultures (kept supernatants separate
and sterile to resuspend cultures in after count - not performing feed)

5) Re-suspended pellets in 400 uL (E125s) and 200 uL (50 mL tubes) of
respective growth media

6) Took 1 x 10 uL sample from each culture and performed cell count using
haemocytometer

7) Re-suspended cultures in original supernatant, moved E-flask cultures back
to E-125s, and returned flasks to incubator

Culture ID / Medium base / vessel  
Observations  
Cell count (if applicable/able to obtain)  
  
7697-NANDO3F-Chicken P3-1of1 / CD CHO / 50 mL tube  
Very few cells, all appear dead  
NA  
  
7695-NANDO3F-Chicken P3-1of1 / DMEM/F12 / 50 mL tube  
Unable to find any live cells, just scattered debris  
NA  
  
7700-NANDO3F-Chicken P3-1of1 / CDM4 Avian / E125  
Far fewer cells than 7694, most appear dead, however some could be live -
difficult to tell  
14,000  
  
7694-F_DOLLY12-Sheep P11-1of1 / CD CHO / E125  
Lots of cells but all cells appear dead (fully penetrated by trypan blue).
Cells are, however, mostly round with nice morphology, and there is almost no
debris. Counted cells with good morphology despite blue stain.  
362,240
