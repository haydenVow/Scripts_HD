Process:

  1. Obtain a tissue culture treated 100 mm petri dish and a tissue culture treated 6-well plate.
  2. Transfer one of each into a sterile BSC.
  3. Remove both items from their respective packaging
  4. Add 3 mL of dPBS to any 2 wells of the 6-well plate.
  5. Parafilm both items.
  6. Transfer both items into the -80 freezer for 30 minutes. Start/Finish time: 12:05 - 12:35
  7. Remove from the -80 freezer and leave at room temperature for 5 minutes. Observe for any cracks. No obvious deformation or cracks were seen in both the petri dish and 6-well plate. Both culture vessels held their shape under moderate squeezing and pressing.
  8. Return both items to the -80 freezer for another 30 minutes. Start/Finish time: 12:44 - 13:14
  9. Remove from the -80 freezer and leave at room temperature for 5 minutes. Observe for any cracks. Same observation as step 7.
  10. Return both items to the -80 freezer for the final 30 minutes. Start/Finish time: 13:20 - 13:50
  11. Perform a final check on the integrity of the two culture vessels. Both vessels did not display any visible signs that they had cracked or that the sterility would be compromised during the freeze-thaw cycle. 




Observations/Summary:

\- Neither the petri dish nor the 6-well plate displayed any physical signs of
cracking or deformation and held their shape even under the influence of
moderate squeezing and pressing.

\- The use of parafilm to critical to ensure that the culture sterility is
maintained as the vessels do slightly expand when allowed to warm up to room
temperature after being taken out of the -80'C freezer.
