RELATED TO MILESTONE:  Milestone 1C: Identify any proliferation media
ingredients that inhibit differentiation and start a 16 factor differentiation
experiment #2

AIM/PURPOSE: To screen for media ingredients known to promote serum-free
differentiation as identified in literature. Specifically, this experiment
aims to look at the impact of adding these factors to our E6 media after cells
have been proliferated in ACF media (E89C).

HYPOTHESIS: From the 16 factors tested, we will be to identify at least 3
factors that can be added to E6 differentiation media to promote
differentiation.

RESULTS SUMMARY: See report.

CONCLUSIONS: Adding B27 supplement in E6 media promoted muscle
differentiation. BMP2, EGF, and LIF were found to inhibit muscle
differentiation. Poloxamer 188 had no effect on the differentiation of
myoblasts.

Note: The TGFb used in this experiment was not reconstituted according to the
manufacturer's instructions which may have impacted results.

NEXT STEPS: EPIC16782 incorporates findings from this experiment by testing an
ACF proliferation media that does not contain EGF and LIF. Cells proliferated
in this media may be able to differentiate better than cells grown in our
standard E810C media.
