Assay Dev Methods

  1.  Filtered 1mL PBS with 0.22um syringe filter to remove any possible debris
  2. added 5uL PI and 20uL Hoechst to 1mL PBS to create staining mix
  3. added 100uL of staining mix to each well in a 96wp (8 wells total)

4\. Collected 20uL (or 10uL if testing ability to see accurate change in
counts) of cell sample (cells in growth media) to 96wp  

5\. incubated at room temp in the dark for 10-20 min

6\. Imaged whole wells on the Zaber, DAPI exposure=70, PI exposure=250

7\. Analyzed DAPI cell counts with MIA using DAPI count macro -- need to
develop PI counting macro!!!

8\. Performed hemocytometer count on sample to determine actual cell count and
viability

                 total cell count: 1,072,000/mL   

                 dead cells: 172,000

                 viability: ~84%
