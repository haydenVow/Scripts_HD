Observations/Summary:

  * Loaded plate onto Zaber and wasnt able to focus on cells for some reason
  * Checked on both main lab and library lab Zabers
  * Checked on Axio at 5X and 10X
  * Realised that there are no cells in the wells.
  * Last date where plates were checked under the microscope was the 3rd of Aug (Day 6 of differentiation) and there were cells.
  * No floating dead cells either which likely means that the cells either died from Day 6 to Day 14 of culture or during the fixing process. If cells died during staining process, we would likely see remnants some cells still adhered to plates as the whole process was only four hours long.
  * Unlikely during the fixing process as it was only one day ago and there should still be some cell matter in the wells.
  * Most likely scenario is cell death in the culture period from Day 6 - 14. Cultures were kept in the Thermo incubator at all times.
  * It's worth noting that on 28th July, plate 7440 was imaged and some cell death can be seen in the wells that contain controls.
