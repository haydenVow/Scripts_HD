Process:

 1\. Aliquotted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and
then placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath for a minimum of 20 minutes
prior to use:

  1.  TrypLE:  100 mL in | 1 | tubes
  2. dPBS (for washing)   100 mL in | 1 | tubes 
  3.  dPBS (for neutralising)   100 mL in | 1 | tubes 
  4.  Growth media (for pellet resuspension):  20 mL in | 1 | tubes 
  5.  Time that all aliquots were placed in the water bath to warm before use:   12:55 

Note: if aliquots were placed in water bath at different times, record the
time stamp for each individual solution.




2\. Washed the flask(s) with dPBS.

3\. Added | 100 mL | tryple to each vessel/well and incubated at 37ºC for | 13
| min

  1.  Timestamp: 13:22 - 13:35   

4\. Neutralised with | 100 mL | dPBS (warmed) and combined cell suspension
into | 4 x 50 mL | tubes.

5\. Centrifuged at 650 x g for 5 min

  1.  Start/Finish time for centrifugation was:   13:44 - 13:49   




6\. Aspirated the supernatant(s).

7\. Resuspend pellet(s) in | 5 |mL | growth | media.

8\. Performed a cell count using the haemocytometer and recorded the cell
count data in the Google Doc spreadsheet called 'Cell Count Spreadsheet' (see
link below):

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1DPzKubYxfHmWogVPihC-
SSIBtIylyrBQE5kRX5Z8NtI/edit#gid=0

9\. Total cell number was: | 17,940,000 |

10\. Calculate the required volume cell suspension & freeze medium to generate
a concentration of ~1M cells/mL.




11\. Prepared  28 mL Freeze Medium: (FBS + 10% DMSO). ID #6438  

Stored at 4ºC until use to keep chilled.

12\. Centrifuged cells at 650 x g for 5 min.  14:45  \-  14:50  

Whilst centrifuge is spinning, prepared & printed vial labels, labelled
cryovials. (Note that passage number will be the same as the culture you
harvest from. The passage number will increase by 1 during the revive of a
vial.)




13\. Aspirated supernatant carefully, taking care not to disturb the pellet.

14\. Resuspended the pellet in | 17 |mL freeze media (chilled, to reduce DMSO
toxicity).

15\. Aliquotted | 944 |µL into | 18 | x cryovials (already labelled).

16\. Tightened the lids & transfer the cryovials to a Mr. Frosty immediately
into the -80ºC freezer.   15:11

  * [ ]  Without foam
  * [ ]  1st Freeze
  * [x]  2nd Freeze

  * [ ]  4th Freeze
  * [ ]  5th Freeze

17\. Allow the cells to freeze for at least 18-24 hours before transferring to
Liquid Nitrogen storage.
