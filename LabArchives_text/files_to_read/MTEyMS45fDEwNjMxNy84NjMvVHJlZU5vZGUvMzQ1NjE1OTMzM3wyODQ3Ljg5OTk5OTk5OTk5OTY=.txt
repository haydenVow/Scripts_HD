### Process:

1\. Took image of vessel with microscope on phase setting.

2\. Gelatin coated     4     x     T175     vessel with sterile filtered 0.1%
gelatin solution and then incubated all coated flasks at 37˚C.

  1. Time when all vessels(s) placed into the incubator       14:16   a/pm 

3\. Aliquotted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then
placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath for a minimum of 20 minutes
prior to use:

  1. TrypLE:     30    mL in     1 x 50 mL Centrifuge    tubes
  2.  dPBS (for washing and neutralising):     30    mL in   1 x 50mL Centrifuge     tubes
  3. Growth media (for pellet resuspension):     5    mL in     120mL Urine Container    tubes
  4. Growth media (for seeding):     90    mL in     120mL Urine Container    tubes

Time that all aliquots were placed in the water bath the warm before use
15:15 (GM) 14:25 (Tryple, dPBS)

Note: if aliquots were placed in water bath at different time, record the time
stamp for each individual solution.




4\. Removed vessel(s) from the incubator     14:38   a/pm

5\. Washed the vessel(s) with 10mL dPBS (warmed).

6\. Added     10    mL tryple to each vessel/well and incubated at 37˚C.

Flasks were checked every 10 mins until <90% detachment was observed.

  1. Start/Finish for TrypLE was     14:52 - 15:18   a/pm 

7\. Neutralised with     10mL     dPBS and combined cell suspension into a
2 x 50mL    tube.

8\. Centrifuged at 650 x g for 5 min.

  1. Start/Finish time for centrifugation was     15:26 (Start Time)   a/pm 




9\. Aspirated the supernatant(s).

10\. Resuspended pellet(s) in     3    mL    Growth Media      media

11\. Aliquoted      20uL    of resuspended cells into a microcentrifuge tube
for cell count.

12\. Performed a cell count using the haemocytometer and recorded the cell
count data in the Google Doc spreadsheet called 'Cell Count Spreadsheet' (see
link below):

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1DPzKubYxfHmWogVPihC-
SSIBtIylyrBQE5kRX5Z8NtI/edit#gid=0

  1.  Total cell number was:     1,036,800       

  2. Volume of cell suspension required for subculture was:      2.7mL       

  3. Cell density per vessel:     345600 Cells      




13\. Transferred      27000     µl of cell suspension to the pre-warmed
90    mL Growth media:      15:58    a/pm

14\. Transferred cell suspension into the pre-gelatin coated       3 x T175
vessel.

15\. Left at RT in the BSC for 30 min to allow cells to settle      16:00  -
16:35 a/pm  

16\. Transferred vessel(s) to incubate at:

  * [x]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (avian cells)

Observations/Summary:

When incubator was opened to look for #6630 this culture could not be found.
Remembering that there was a labelling error, the inside of each T Flask was
examined to reveal that "DAISY" had been written on the culture #6640 flask.
It was suspected that this was the 3rd flask that needed to be passaged and
was confirmed by observing morphology which strongly resembeled existing DAISY
clone irregular morphologies. Hence this flask was passaged along with #6642
and #6643.

  

90mL of GM was mistakenly aliquotted for seeding instead of 120mL, hence 3
T175s were seeded instead of 4. Has been slightly overseeded, however it is
unlikely that these cells will acheive confluency in a quick fashion.
Regardless, flasks will be monitored just in the off chance that growth rate
is accelerated due to passage and fresh medium.

Cell morphologies look as irregular as before with uneven sizes, long large
black ECM structures when adhered, under 10X magnification you can see cells
appear to be undergoing a form of stress or possibly senecence as has been
discussed beforehand.

Cell harvest followed a normal protocol however cell numbers were quite low in
comparison to other MuSCs used regularly.

    * [ ]  As Usual (this is a repetitive task)
    * [X]  Unexpected because of irregular morphologies and growth rates of DAISY clones
    * [ ]  Need to be further analysed
    * [ ]  Other (.......)
