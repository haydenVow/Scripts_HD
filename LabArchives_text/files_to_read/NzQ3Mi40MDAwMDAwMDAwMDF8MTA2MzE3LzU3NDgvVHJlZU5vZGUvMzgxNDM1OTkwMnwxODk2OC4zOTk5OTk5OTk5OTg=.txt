## Remove the Stimulation Lead Wire

1\. Removed the hook test clips from the electrode connection pins on the
culture dish lid  
  
The test hook can be released from the pin by squeezing the spring loaded test
hook handle. It is best not to touch the metal electrode pins while doing
this. Hold the plastic culture dish lid for stability. If any wires become
dislodged and the operator is unsure about reattachment, contact experiment
owner for assistance   Addy - 0432715545




Media Change  
  
1\. Retrieved  40 mL  of  E6 Media from a   1 x 50 mL  tube from Fridge #117
next to biostat (brown falcon tubes with green top).  
  
2\. Aliquots placed in water bath for 20 mins 10:50 am

3\. Carefully lifted the lid off the plate and placed it on the BSC surface
such that the electrodes in contact with the cells do not touch anything. This
can be achieved by flipping the plate upside down.

4\. Removed 100% of supernatant (per well/per vessel) and replaced with 1.5 mL
of E6 Diff media, ensuring to do so one well at a time. Changed tips between
plates (can keep the same tip for all wells in a plate).

5\. Returned vessels to incubate and connected the test hooks back up to the
electrode pins on the culture dish lid so that each set of hooks connects to
the corresponding wire colour and so that the black hooks are aligned on the
left side of each well and the red hooks on the right (see wiring setup
reference image below)   11:47 a/pm

6\. Ensured that the oscilloscope displayed a curved waveform for both the
purple and yellow channels (you may need to wake up the oscilloscope by
pressing on the knob directly underneath the word 'Horizontal').
