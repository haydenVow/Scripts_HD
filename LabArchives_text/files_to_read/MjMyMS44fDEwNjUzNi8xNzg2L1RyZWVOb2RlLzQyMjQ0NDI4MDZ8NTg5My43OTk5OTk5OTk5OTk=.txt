Topped up media from 70L to 180L (added 110L)  

Performed by: CB/AK

  * In-tubing from palletank bag was welded to the same sized in-tubing on the STR200L (Not the dip tube)
  * We decided not to use the dip tube because of the amount of handling it experienced when the STR200 was initially filled up. Therefore as a contamination risk we decided not to use this tube again with this bag.
