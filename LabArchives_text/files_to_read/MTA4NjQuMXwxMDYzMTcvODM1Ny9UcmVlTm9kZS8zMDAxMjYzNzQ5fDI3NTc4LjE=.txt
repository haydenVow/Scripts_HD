Protocol

  1. Check gas pressure at regulator for all gases in use. Ensure pressure is the same, and is between 1-3 bar.
  2. Check alarms in warnings and alerts screen. Dismiss any non-applicable alarms. 
  3. Inspect each physical bioreactor and ensure all clamps are sealed. Check the colour and consistency of the broth (e.g. if milky - contamination, or foamy - cell death)
  4. Inspect the bioreactor specs in the software and note if any parameter is out of spec. 

  
  
Deviations & notes

  * Air: 150 kPa, CO2: 1.5 bar, O2: 1.5 bar
  * Some foaming present in BR 1, 3 and 4, with very minor foaming present in BR 2.
  * Aggregates are still present in all bioreactors.
  * Regarding pH, the offline values for BR 1, 2 and 4 were within 0.08 units of the online values (and as such were not changed). BR 3's offline value was almost 0.2 units off (7.36 offline vs 7.18 online) and so the offset was adjusted.

Protocol

  1. Follow on-screen prompts to draw sample from the sampling line: 
    * take 1mL draw and discard
    * take 1mL draw and place in 50mL falcon tube
  2. Cell count 0.2mL in 1.5mL tube and record in G-sheet (below)
  3. Return remaining cell suspension from 1.5mL tube to 50mL falcon tube for pH reading
  4. Calibrate pH meter and read values for all samples. Record pH values below in G-sheet

*Note: temporarily using this sheet to record data (as AV doesn't have editing access)

Passage notes

  

Stock flask A counts = 864k live, 20k dead

Live: 41, 39, 51, 42, 43

Dead: 2, 0, 1, 2, 0

To seed an E500 flask (150 mL) with 200k cells, need ~35 mL of C/S and 115 mL
of media (+115 uL of IGF and 23 uL of EGF).

  

Stock flask B counts = 976k live, 60k dead

Live: 41, 47, 57, 54, 45

Dead: 1, 3, 3, 1, 7

To seed an E500 flask (150 mL) with 200k cells, need ~31 mL of C/S and 119 mL
of media (+119 uL of IGF and 23.8 uL of EGF).

  

Stock flask C (F/S) counts = 284k live, 72k dead

Live: 18, 15, 11, 15, 12

Dead: 1, 2, 5, 5, 5

Flask was left as is.
