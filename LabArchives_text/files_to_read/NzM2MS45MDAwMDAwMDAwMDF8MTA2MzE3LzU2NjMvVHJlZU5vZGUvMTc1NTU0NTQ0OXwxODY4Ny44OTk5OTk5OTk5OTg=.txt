With a view to expanding the diversity of our cell banks, Vow has sourced a a
Bennetts Wallaby (also known as a Red-necked Wallaby) sample from Lenah Game
Meats in Tasmania. This will be our 2nd attempt at isolating wallaby cells. In
our previous attempt, we were unsuccessful in establishing an adherent cell
population from the cultured isolated, which we believe to have been due to
the sample arriving frozen, rather than fresh, which would greatly affect cell
viablity. See lab book here: https://au-

Due to their hardiness and rapid rates of proliferation, Vow currently uses
fibroblasts for the majority of our R&D including in the key areas of
suspension cell adaption, as well as product development. In order to select
fibroblasts from crude homogenate,  the initial culture will focus on the
expansion of the plastic adherent population from the mixed population within
the isolate. Portions of the isolate will also be cryopreserved, so that if
desired, other cell types may also be selected for when culturing in the
future.  
  
We plan to follow the biopsy, isolation and culture protocols previously
developed by Vow for the isolation of primary cells from mammalian tissue as
we believe these techniques will be transferable to marsupial tissues and
cells.
