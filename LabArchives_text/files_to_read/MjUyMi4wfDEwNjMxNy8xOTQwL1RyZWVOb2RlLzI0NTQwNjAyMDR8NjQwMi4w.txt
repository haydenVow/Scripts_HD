Background


Suspension culture of fibroblasts is being attempted ini order to achieve a
higher cell density of our cell cultures (compared to adherent culture), in
order to produce food for billions of people.

Whilst there is limited published literature on adapting adherent cells to
suspension culture, there are indications of factors that may assist in the
process. Reported in Background #1 and Background #2, some key ingredients
were identified including:

\- ROCK inhibitors

\- Anti-clumping agent

\- Pluronic F-68 (Poloxamer 188)

\- RGD / YIGSR peptides

\- HDACs (histone dehydrogenases)

  

  

As of 21-June-2021, 1:100 Anti-clumping agent appears to maintain higher
viability than serum controls.

  

Anti-clumping agent and RevitaCell were used in Trial #2, and Pluronic was
included in trial #3 (when RevitaCell was replaced with ROCK-inhibitor
(Y-27632) ). Results are still preliminary and cannot be used to draw any
conclusions.

  

In this experiment (Trial #4), we will be trialling RGD, YIGSR peptides and
HDACs (histone dehydrogenases) in addition to 1:100 anti-clumping agent.

In this experiment, Anti-clumping agent will also be added fresh every time.
Since we are unaware of the ingredients in Anti-clumping agentâ„¢, we are
unaware of whether there are any components that may break down over time in
Growth Media.
