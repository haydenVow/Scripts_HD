Protocol run:

96 wp (to be passaged) was Zaber scanned (Phase, whole well, 5x) - time not
recorded

plate with growth media warmed in incubator: 13:16 - 13:38

Plate/s taken out from incubator: 13:38

Start run: 1:44:02 PM  

Run time: 1:07:58

Passaged wells imaged on Zaber: 14:57  

Plate/s returned to incubator: 15:00

Performed a 50% feed for wells that were not passaged from plate 7876 using
D/F + 10% FBS + 1x P/S/.  




Observations/Summary:

Some wells have many cells remaining in them (see images) - it seems like they
have not detached. The dead volume remaining in the 96 wp is ~15 uL.

All wells of the 24 well plate have cells visible.

well E3 after passage - probably has the least amount of cells remaining
