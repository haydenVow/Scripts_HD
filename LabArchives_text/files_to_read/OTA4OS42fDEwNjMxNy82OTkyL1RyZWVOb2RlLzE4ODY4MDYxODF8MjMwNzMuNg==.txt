Note

A precipitate has been observed in images of Hoechst stained cells. We are
concerned that this may be affecting the accuracy of counts. In addition,
exposure times when imaging are likely to affect counts. In order to assses
both these issues, different staining conditions were trialed today. No feed
was performed, with samples being collected directly from the E125 Flasks.

Process:  

  1. Place media in water bath >15min prior to use 
  2. Collected E125s from shaker, wiped with ethanol-sprayed Rediwipe, and brought into BSC
  3. Using a 5 mL serological pipette, mixed culture for 1 minute to break up cell clumps.
  4. Took 100 uL sample loaded onto a 96 well plate according to the plate map. 
  5. Returned E125s to incubator, 138, Library Lab. 37C and 5% CO2. 

  




Staining

Prepared Hoechst stain (50 ug/mL) solution in amber/black centrifuge tube:  
\- 9500uL MilliQ  
\- 500uL Hoechst Trihydrochloride trihydrate (1mg/mL)  
\- Vortex for 5 seconds to mix. Solution can be stored at 4Â°C for up to 6
months

  1. Took 100 uL samples from each culture flask
  2. Added 20 uL of Hoechst stain directly to cells
  3. Added 80 uL of MilliQ directly to cells 
  4. Incubated for 30 minutes in the dark at room temperature  
  5. Made 4x, 8x and dilutions of the sample in dPBS 
  6. Centrifuged plates at 300 g for 1 minute 
  7. Prepared plate maps

  8. Plate ID: 10544 Link: https://ranger.vow.tools/#/session/recrJlhivxGA9Xq7V/images
  9. Imaged on the Zaber, then sent for to Mia for cell count analysis. Results here: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1YuTvXJXQQMIMwRZGeqNjdi20WeURg5FpM-1TJ-zrb1c/edit#gid=2066571586




Observations/Summary:  
There was very little precipitate in the Nuvonis culture, or Nuvonis media on
its own.  
The OptiPro media was the worst affected by the precipitate.  
Cell counts varied dramatically with changes in imaging exposure times.
