### Process:

1\. Took image of vessel with microscope on phase setting.

2\. Aliquotted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then
placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath for a minimum of 15 minutes
prior to use:

  1. TrypLE:    5   mL in   1 x 15mL falcon  tube
  2.  dPBS (for neutralising):     5mL  
  3.  dPBS (for washing):    5mL   
  4. Growth media (for pellet resuspension):     1    mL
  5. Growth media (for seeding):    500uL per well x 24 = 12 + 1mL barrier = 13mL    mL 

Time that all aliquots were placed in the water bath the warm before use
11:04   a/pm

Note: if aliquots were placed in water bath at different time, record the time
stamp for each individual solution.




4\. Removed vessel(s) from the incubator     13:30 pm

5\. Washed the vessel(s) with dPBS (warmed).

6\. Added     5    mL tryple to each vessel/well and incubated at 37˚C.

  1. Start/Finish for TrypLE was  13:46 -  14:05 pm (20 mins)  

7\. Neutralised with     5     dPBS @ 14:07 and performed "waterfall"
technique 3 times.

Combined cell suspension into a   15mL or 50mL falcon tube.

8\. Centrifuged at 650 x g for 5 min.

  1. Start/Finish time for centrifugation was     14:11 - 14:16    




9\. Aspirated the supernatant(s).

10\. Resuspended pellet(s) in     1    mL     Growth    media   14:25 pm

11\. Aliquoted     20uL     of resuspended cells into a microcentrifuge tube
for cell count. Take the aliquot outside the BSC and add 20uL of Trypan Blue.
Mix well, then add 10uL of this 40uL suspension onto a haemocytometer slide
for cell counting.  

12\. Performed a cell count using the haemocytometer and recorded the cell
count data in the Google Doc spreadsheet: Cell Count Spreadsheet or cell count
widget below

  1. Total cell number harvested from T75:       219 200     

  2. Cells required per well of 24 well plate:    14,250      

  3. Cells in total required to seed all wells of a 24 well plate:   342,000      

  4. Hence, volume of the 1mL cell suspension required to seed    342,000     




13\. Transferred     156      µl of cell suspension to the pre-warmed     13
mL Growth media:      15:12 pm

14\. Transferred     500    µl of the 13mL cell suspension into each well of
the     24 well plate  

16\. Transferred vessel(s) to incubate at: 15:27

  * [X]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (avian cells)




Observations/Summary:

\- threw away remaining cells

Version Change Log

NameChange Details  
V1 (original)N/A  
V2Changed all sentences to past tense to better reflect a hand-written lab
book entry.  
Various formatting changes.  
Addition of more detail to step 2, removal of step 3. Replaced volume
requirements table with updated volumes @Sep 22, 2020  
Updated temperature selection for mammalian/aviary cells @Sep 23, 2020  
V3Included a section for 'vessel type' in passage ID table Replace
'flask/plate' with 'vessel' throughout lab book Include at step 1 to take
image of vessel on the microscope  
Mentioned that dPBS for washing should be warm - step 3(2) and 5.  
Added timepoint at step 4 for when vessel is removed from incubator  
Include at step 11 to aliquot cell resuspension into microcentrifuge tube  
Included at step 10 and 13 time point for when cell pellet is resuspended and
when resuspended cells is moved into growth media.  
Included p38i in table of regent used  
Combined two dPBS entries in 'Media/reagents' table Added 'cell density per
vessel'
