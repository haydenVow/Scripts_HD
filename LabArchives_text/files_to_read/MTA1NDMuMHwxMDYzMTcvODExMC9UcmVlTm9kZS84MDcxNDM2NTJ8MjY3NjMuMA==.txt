Passage 1 - Thaw vials


# Procedure \- Thaw and Seed

1\. Place media and media equilibrated carriers in water bath, warm to cell
incubation temperatures

2\. Calculate required amount of cells.

3\. Select the vial/s for thawing. Note the location of the vial in Liquid
Nitrogen(LN) Dewer.  
Path: Ranger > Frozen Cultures > Select Vial/s (Use highest number first, ie
62of62)

4\. Obtain selected number of cryovial/s from LN Dewar and thaw in the 30'C
water bath on a foam floater for a maximum of 5 minutes.  
*NOTE: Ensure to wear PPE and work swiftly whilst performing this this task. Ensure to wear cryogloves and face shield when handling the liquid nitrogen dewar. Ask a Vowzer for help if required.

5\. Spray and wipe the cryovial and growth media thoroughly with 70% EtOH and
transfer into the Biohazard Safety Cabinet (BSC).

6\. Slowly add 500uL of growth media into the/each vial. This will produce a
total of 1mL cell suspension per vial.

7\. Resuspend the cells gently and transfer all contents from the vial to the
bottom of a 50mL falcon tube. *NOTE: Dispensing suspension of cells on the
sides of the tube will risk loss of cells in Step 11.

8\. Add an additional 500uL of growth media to each vial to collect remaining
cells and add into the centrifuge tube. A total of 1.5mL will be in each vial.

9\. Resuspend cells thoroughly and immediately extract 50uL into a
microcentrifuge tube.

10\. Perform cell count (Refer to VSOP-007) from collected sample and use the
Cell Counting Widget (below) to enter data.

11\.  Extract all contents from the centrifuge tube and dispense into the
prepared media+carriers. Pippette solution up and down throughly, aliquot
required amount to wells.

12\. Transfer wells to a shaker platform inside of an incubator, incubate
while shaking for 5 mins followed by 25 mins of rest. Repeat 4 times.

13\. Static culture cells in incubator at appropriate cell culture
temperatures.

If seeding fromThen...  
VialIncubate overnight before a 50% change the day after seeding  
FlaskIncubate for 72 hrs before a 50% change (or passage) is required
