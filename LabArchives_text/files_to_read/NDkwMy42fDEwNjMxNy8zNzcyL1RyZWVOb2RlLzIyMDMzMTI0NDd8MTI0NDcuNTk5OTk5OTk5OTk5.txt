Prepare materials for thaw and seed:

1\. Make media for re-suspending the cells: 9.9mLs of DMEM/F12 + 10% FBS + 1x
PS + 100uL of anti-clumping agent. Place media to warm in the water bath for a
minimum of 20 minutes prior to use:

  *  Growth media (for seeding):   10 mL 
  * Growth media (for re-suspending pellet): 8 mL   

  * Time that aliquot was placed in the water bath to warm before use:  15:07  

  

2\. Prepare a chamber for the hanging droplets as per your learnings from
playing with the hanging drop culture method.




## Thaw and seed vial:

3\. Collected the cryovial from Liquid Nitrogen storage & place in foam
floater in water bath for 5 min  15:30 - 15:34

Location where cryovial was collected from:

Vial details: 1 x DOLLY12_F cryovial at 1M cells each for a total of 1M cells

Brew

Tower/Bucket # 2

Box/Cane # 2

Vial location: F2

Vial ID(s): 2332-Culture-6303-Vial-53of115

4\. Ethanol sprayed & transferred the vial(s) to the BSC.

5\. Add  0.5 mL of Growth Media (to generate a total volume of 1mL in the
cryovial) to the cryovial, then transfer to 15 mL tube containing 8 mL warmed
medium

6\. Centrifuged 15 mL tube for 5 minutes at 600 x g. 15:35 - 15:40

7\. Aspirated 100% of supernatent and resuspended in 10 mL Growth Medium (for
seeding)

8\. Using a 10mL serological pipette, resuspended & distributed the cells
evenly

9\. Hang 20 (+/-2) x 10 uL droplets per lid of 6 x 60 mm cell culture plates
(as per learning from playing with hanging droplets exploration)  
  
10\. Observe droplets under the microscope, image & record observations.

11\. Transfer plate(s) to incubate at:

  * [x]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells) THERMO
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (aviary cells)
