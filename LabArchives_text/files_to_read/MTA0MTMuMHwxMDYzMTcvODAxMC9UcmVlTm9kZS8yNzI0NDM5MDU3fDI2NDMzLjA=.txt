Process


  1. Removed flasks from incubator 
  2. Took 2 x 550 uL samples from each E-flask
  3. Performed cell counts and averaged for each flask and each condition (recorded in table below)
  4. Removed 5 mL from 12057 for ViCell optimisation 
  5. Aliquoted following volumes of media with growth factors and warmed in water bath to reduce density. Checked table below to see if any cultures require expansion into larger E-flask. 
    1. 90/10: 200 mL + IGF + EGF \+ 0.0005 mg/mL IGF + 0.0001 mg/mL EGF
    2. 100/0: 20 mL + 0.0005 mg/mL IGF + 0.0001 mg/mL EGF
    3. 100/0: 20 mL + 0.0005 mg/mL IGF + 0.0005 mg/mL FGF-B \+ 0.0001 mg/mL EGF
  6. Transferred 100/0 culture to 2 x 50 mL tube (15 mL, 5M cells per tube)
  7. Centrifuged at 500 x g for 5 min
  8. Aspirated 100% of supernatant and resuspended one tube in 20 mL medium with FGF and one tube in 20 mL medium without FGF
  9. Strained cultures through 40 um cell strainer into 2 x new E-flask
  10.  ~~Added 200 mL of 90/10 media to culture (bring up to 750 mL)~~ Accidentally added 350 mL of media so culture is at 900 mL 
  11.  ~~Strained 90/10 culture through 40 um cell strainer into new E-flask(s)  ~~Worried straining with small cell strainers is introducing contamination ~~  
~~

  12. Returned culture to incubate at 37 'C, 5% CO2, 110 RPM

Some clumping but not too bad, keeping in same flask for now and not straining
due to fear of contamination. Need larger strainers that fit in neck of E1000+
