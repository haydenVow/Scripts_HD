Batch 18 Overview

Batch Goals:

  * Optimisation: Improve upon previous experimental findings and continue to find new ways to increase batch yield in adherent cultures 

Experimental Questions:

  1. Does co-culture with Myoblasts and Fibroblasts result in a higher yield?
  2. Does VitC Only treatment or VitC + TGFb treatment produce the highest yield in Fibroblast ONLY roller bottles?

Treatment Used/Experimental Timeline:

TGFb (10ng/mL) and VitC (50ug/mL) applied at day 7 to all experimental groups
except the Fibro ONLY VitC treated group which received ONLY VitC treatment at
day 7 (See Experiment timeline diagram below).

Answers to Experimental Questions:

  1. Does co-culture with Myoblasts and Fibroblasts result in a higher yield?  
No. There was obvious difference between Fibroblasts and Myoblasts alone
compared to co-cultures. However in the co-cultures a lower seeding density
(5kcells/cm2) was seen to be more beneficial as the higher seeding density
resulted premature peeling.  
  

  2. Does VitC Only treatment or VitC + TGFb treatment produce the highest yield in Fibroblast ONLY roller bottles?   
Despite peeling (unlike the TGFb + VitC Bottle), treatment with VitC ONLY did
produce a higher yield. However this difference in yield is not great and more
experiments with a higher sample size would be required to confirm this
difference.

Deviations:

  * the Original Batch 18 Fibroblast Flasks seeded on the 10/SEPT (4xT175) appeared contaminated on Tuesday, 14th September. The following steps were taken:

  1. Aliquots of each flask were taken and dispensed into respective T25 flasks. 
  2. T25 flasks were placed in the incubator for a maximum of 5 days to observe for turbidity. 
  3. T175 flasks were parafilmed and discarded into the clinical waste bin. 
  4. A CAR was raised for the incident identified. 
  5. A new Fibroblast seeding was seeded on 17th September, 2021. More flasks were seeded in this re-seed (1x2CF and 4xT175) to allow for a simultaneous harvest with the optimal amount of cells alongside Batch 18 myoblasts. 

  * This was the first batch placed onto the RP80. Sadly overnight the apparatus stopped rolling and all bottles on the RP80 (16xR850) had to be discarded
    * One of each group including the 2x Fibroblast only bottles (6xR850) were placed on the small Thermo apparatus in the Top Left Binder Incubator, these were fine and the experiment was continued with only these bottles from this point on wards
