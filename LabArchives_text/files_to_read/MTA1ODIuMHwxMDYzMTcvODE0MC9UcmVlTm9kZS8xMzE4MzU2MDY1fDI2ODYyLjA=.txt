AMBR Inoculation Process

  1. Notes recorded here and transferred to Lab Archives

  2. Opened AMBR run time program and selected 'continue process' and used Vow 1 pre-programmed run

  3. Turned TCU on at 9:29 am

  4. Remove bioreactor vessels from the AMBR unit and clean the ports at 9:36 am

  5. Load the vessels and engage the bioreactors (ensure the pH probe is connected to the AMBR system) at 9:40am

  6. Select the 'Process' tab -> 'Vow 1' -> locate the 'Conditioning and Calibration' tab -> select 'Stir speed on' step / phase -> right click 'Edit' -> select the RPMs that are being tested

  7. Under the 'Set point' enter the following parameters: 200, 300, 400, 500 (RPM for the four bioreactors respectively) - EDIT: changed parameters to 150, 250, 350, 450 RPM after consulting with George from BIF

  8. Edit the volumes of the batch by selecting 'Vow 1' -> 'Volumes' -> 'Batch media' in the 'Components' table -> change the volume to 190 mL

  9. Set up the reservoirs:

    1. Select 'Process' -> 'Vow 1' -> 'Pumps A-E'

    2. Assign the role of 'Pump A' as the feed (consisting of 3:1 R:H + GFs + antifoam at 1:100 dilution to dose entire volume at 1:10 000 every time scheduled feed is pumped in)

    3. Assign the role of 'Pump B' as the base (1M sodium bicarbonate)

    4. Ensure the remainder of the pumps are marked as 'Not used'

  10. Select 'Process' and explore around the screen to locate the 'Steps on days within phase' table and change the sample volume to 2 mL (1 mL x 2; once to purge the line and another to take the sample)

  11. Delete any 'Calculated antifoam bolus' steps (as the AF was added to the feed media)

  12. Start bioreactors

  13. Enter spot calibration data using QR code and webcam -> Save data

  14. Go to 'Bioreactor 1' -> select 'Borrow' -> choose all bioreactors and press 'Disengage' (make sure to remove the headplate and pH probe)

  15. Fill Reservoirs A and B with feed media (+ GFs + antifoam) and base respectively inside a BSC - EDIT: added inoculum at this time as well with growth factors for entire media volume in each vessel  

  16. Return the vessels to the AMBR system and attach headplates and pH probe

  17. Select 'Bioreactor 1' -> press 'Return' -> select 'All bioreactors' -> press 'Engage'

    1. Let the system warm up the media inside the vessel (may need to wait 20-30 mins for the 'Wait until at temperature' step)

    2. If it fails, select 'Failed bioreactors' -> then press 'Retry' (this will add in a duplicate step to repeat the failed step)

    3. For any step that takes too long, the wait time can be changed by going to 'Process' -> selecting the relevant step in the 'Conditioning and calibration' table (e.g. 'Check for pH drift') -> 'Edit' -> 'Timing' -> select 'Maximum wait time' (e.g. 2m, 5m) -> 'oKaY'

  18. EDIT - left cells for 30 mins to incubate in reactor while media coming to 37degC from room temp. Returned and continued to follow prompts

  19. Followed on-screen prompts to set pH offset. Drew 2mL and read using pH probe. Followed prompts on-screen to record the offset value for each reactor. Used same volume to take time-0 cell counts for each reactor NOTE - pH was ~7.9 as per offline readings. Cell viability was ~30-45% across reactors  

  20. EDIT: pH and dead-band altered in consultation with George from BIF. George recommended 7.3 set point with 0.1 dead-band: To change the pH set point and dead band:

    1. Go to 'Process' -> 'Vow 1' -> 'Control loops' -> Edit 'pH lower' and 'pH upper'; from this menu, the CO2 gas flow rate can also be changed by editing the 'Maximum (mL / min)' - can be used to alter the rate at which the pH changes

    2. Go to 'Bioreactor 1' -> 'pH' -> 'Set' -> change set point

  21. EDIT: Deleted prompts for further sampling  
  
  
  
  
  
  

Troubleshooting & deviations:

  

  * Cells had poor viability when counted using the NucleoCounter (~50% or lower) - the density had also dropped by half and was around 50k cells / mL

  * The satellite flask had a density of 119k cells / mL and a viability of 99%

  * The pH was found to be too high (~7.9) and the pH set point was changed to 7.3 with a deadband of 0.1 (for both CO2 sparging and base addition) see above for notes on how this was done

  * The stirring rate was also reduced to 150, 200, 250, 300 RPM (dropped from 150, 250, 350, 450 RPM) 

  * It was suspected that the high stirring speed / aeration rate could have blown off too much CO2, increasing the pH of the media

  
  
  
  
  

  




Sampling and offline measurements

  1. Labelled x4 50mL falcon tubes 1-4
  2. Followed on-screen prompt to sample bioreactors and recorded in run
  3. Sprayed sample line with EtOH and removed cap
  4. Unclipped clamp on sample line
  5. Opened disposable 5mL syringe with luer-lock and drew 1mL, deposited into 50mL tube. Discarded syringe
  6. Opened disposable 5mL syringe with luer-lock and drew 1mL, deposited 0.5mL into 1.5mL tube (for cell count) and deposited remainder into corresponding 50mL tube. Discarded syringe
  7. Clipped sample line and screwed on cap
  8. Repeated for each AMBR bioreactor vessel
  9. Counted cells using Nucleocounter as per manufacturer's instruction. Used 200uL sample volume per read. 
  10. Deposited remaining cell suspension from 1.5mL tube into corresponding 50mL falcon tube and used offline pH probe (Matteo Toledo) as per manufacturer's instruction and recorded
