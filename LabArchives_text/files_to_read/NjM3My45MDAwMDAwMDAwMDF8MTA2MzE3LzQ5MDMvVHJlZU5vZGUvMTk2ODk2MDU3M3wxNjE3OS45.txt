Process:

  1. Using a P200 inside the BSC, extract 200uL of media from each well onto a pre-labelled 96-well plate. Place the filled 96-well plate onto the bench next to the microscope slide.
  2. Titurate 5 times in the first well using a P20. Then, extract 15uL of media dispense onto the pre-labelled glass slide with a cover slip placed on top. Note: Each glass slide provides enough space for 2 tests.
  3. Repeat step 2 for remaining samples.
  4. Observe for signs of microbial contamination at 20 x magnification.
  5. Capture photos of slides with any signs of contamination and record well location.
    1. It was difficult to determine whether there  was contamination using ethanol wiped slides because even without any growth media on the slide, there appeared to be small dots visible.
  6. Choose 4 random wells to sample into T25 flasks. For each of these, add 1 mL from the well and transfer them to a T25 flask containing 5 mL of CD-CHO + KSR (no P/S). Also add 1mL from the well into a T25 flask containing 5 mL of DMEM/F12 + 10% FBS (no P/S). 
    1. well locations that were chosen: negative control, B2, C4, D6
  7. Incubate T25 flasks in 5% CO2, 37 degrees C.




Observations/Summary:

It was difficult to determine whether there was contamination or just debris
in growth media using microscope slides. Added some samples into DMEM/F12 +
10% FBS in T25 flasks - pH change due to contamination should be more obvious
in this media.
