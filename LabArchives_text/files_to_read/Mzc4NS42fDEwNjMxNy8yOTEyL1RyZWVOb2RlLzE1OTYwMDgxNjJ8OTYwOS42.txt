### Process:

  1. Took images of vessel on phase on the Zaber.
  2. Aliquotted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath for a minimum of 20 minutes prior to use:

TrypLE:    1  mL

 dPBS (for washing):     1.5 mL    mL

Time that all aliquots were placed in the water bath the warm before use
14:36 pm

Note: if aliquots were placed in water bath at different time, record the time
stamp for each individual solution.

  

  1. Added 200uL/well of Growth Media to 20 well of  a 96-well plate and placed the plate in incubator 14:30 




4\. Removed vessel(s) from the incubator     15:03 pm

5\. Washed the vessel(s) with dPBS (warmed) (50uL/well).

6\. Added    25uL/well tryple and incubated at room temp. Start time for
TrypLE was  

Note: for wells in columns 20-23, warm PBS and tryple was used. For wells in
columns 16-19, room temperature pbs and tryple was used.

  1. wells B20-23: 15:19 ( 20 min)  

  2. wells C20-23: 15:20 (30 min)
  3. wells D20-23: 15:22 (60 min)
  4. wells E20-23: 15:23 (90 min)
  5. wells F20-23: 15:25 (120 min)
  6. wells B16-19: 16:12 (20 min)
  7. wells C16-19: 16:13 (20 min)
  8. wells D16-19: 16:14 (30 min)
  9. wells E16-19: 16:15 (60 min)
  10. wells F16-19: 16:16 (90 min)
  11. wells G16-19: 16:17 (120 min)

8\. Transferred cell suspension from each source well to the corresponding
destination well in 96-well plates.

Placed back in incubator at 37C, 5% CO2   17: 40. After this point, plate was
taken in and out of the incubator when cells needed to be seeded  




Observations/Summary:

tryplised 4 wells for each condition at room temp. Transferred cells after
incubation from 384 wp to 96 wp

  * warm tryple, 20 min incubation
  * warm tryple, 30 min incubation
  * warm tryple, 60 min incubation
  * warm tryple, 90 min incubation
  * warm tryple, 120 min incubation
  * room temp tryple, 20 min incubation
  * room temp tryple, 30 min incubation
  * room temp tryple, 60 min incubation
  * room temp tryple, 90 min incubation
  * room temp tryple, 120 min incubation

cells were able to detach with room temp tryple, and room temp incubation
after as little as 20 min. It's possible 15 min would have been enough too (as
cells looked round under the microscope) but no cells were seeded from 15 min
time point

results TBD - we may hoescht or dapi stain cells to count and compare growth
between different tryple timing and temperature
