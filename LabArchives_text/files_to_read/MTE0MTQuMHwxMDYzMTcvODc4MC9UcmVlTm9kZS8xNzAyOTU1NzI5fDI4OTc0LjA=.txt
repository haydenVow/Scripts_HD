# Protocol

  1. Calculate the required components need to make up your volume of Hycell + Nuvonis growth medium in the E8 calculator. Figure 1 provides an example of the volumes of components required to make up 1L of HyCell Cho Nuvonis Medium.
  2. Aliquot the amount of HyCell CHO media needed to make up HyCellCHO+Nuvonis growth medium into a sterile filter (0.22um)*. 
  3. Add your required volume of the following components, before switching on the vacuum pump:
    1.  Difco Yeast Extract UF
    2. L-Ornithine monohydrochloride
    3. Putrescine dihydrochloride
    4. Glutamax 
  4. Filter the growth medium. 
  5. Aliquot the required volume of the following growth factors only if you will be using the growth medium within 7 days of adding the growth medium. 
    1. EGF (Mesokine brand)
    2. IGF (Mesokine brand)
  6. Place in the fridge (4C) until use. 

  

*Note, sterile filter units can filter up to 3L.
