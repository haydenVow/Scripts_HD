Aim/Purpose
  
  
Background

On the 28th of Jul and 4th of Aug, Second Product's Cell Supply team has dealt
with a bacterial contamination with their cultures. To rule out media as a
reason for causing the contamination, we decided to test the media we
currently have in the storage.

Aim

To identify if any of the media we currently have in storage (174 - Fridge 4
degrees) have any contamination

Hypothesis

No flask will show contamination


Methods and Experiment layout


1\. Cell counts performed by Eva.

Media Types Tested:

  * ALQ 13231 - RPMI + Nuvonis
  * ALQ 13242 - Hycell + Nuvonis
  * ALQ 13041 - Hycell + Nuvonis (Suspicious)
  * ALQ 13243 - Hycell + Nuvonis
  * ALQ 13020 - RPMI Basal Media

  

  1. 30mL aliquot of each media type into a separate E125.
  2. Placed on a shaker platform (120 RPM) in ambient for 4 days.

  


Results - 8 Aug 22


For each Media type, there were no visible signs of bacterial or fungal
contamination. Thus, our current media stock is free of contaminants. For
future, we will re-filter the media and use penstrep.
