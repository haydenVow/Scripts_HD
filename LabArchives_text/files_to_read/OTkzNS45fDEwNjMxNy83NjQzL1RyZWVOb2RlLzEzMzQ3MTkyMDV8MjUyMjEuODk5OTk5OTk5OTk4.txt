Process
  
  
  1. Retrieved cultures from incubator
  2. Took 2 x 50 uL samples from each culture 
  3. Performed 6 cell counts (2 per culture). Average cell counts:
    * Freestyle (22.2 mL):
    * 50/50 RPMI/HyCell (3mg/mL yeast) (22.1 mL):
    * 75/25 RPMI/HyCell (3mg/mL yeast) (20.8 mL):
  4. Added averaged counts to spreadsheet (cell column titled "Nt Cell number at 't')") https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1G2Za0sUDijAQUpbmTaQbGTY74R04vCaQCKkvTalXIpE/edit#gid=0
  5. Took XM cells from Freestyle culture to seed CHO-T1-SF experiment 
  6. Reduced all cultures to 1M cells/mL 
  7. Topped media back up to ~20 mL per flask with fresh, warmed media + growth factors
    1. Freestyle: 4,173,600
    2. 50/50: 3,094,000
    3. 75/25: 4,742,400
  8. Returned flasks to incubator
