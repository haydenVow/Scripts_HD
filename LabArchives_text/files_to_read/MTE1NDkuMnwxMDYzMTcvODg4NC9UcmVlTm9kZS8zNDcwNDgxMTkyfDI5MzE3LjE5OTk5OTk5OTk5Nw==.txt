This task should be performed every 2nd or 3rd day, as well as both before AND
after harvesting

Took samples

  1. Unscrewed the "BENCHMARK" sample tube cover.
  2. Sprayed down the tube end with 70% ethanol.
  3. Connected a 5 mL sterile syringe.
  4. Withdrew slightly more than 3 mL (to purge the line).
  5. Discarded the 5 mL syringe.
  6. Connected a fresh sterile syringe and withdrew 3.5 - 4.0 mL of sample.
  7. Disconnected sample syringe and transferred 1 mL of sample each to 3 x 1.5 mL Eppendorf tubes for subsequent analysis:
    * Performed ViCell count: 50k cells/mL, 94% viability
    * Performed manual cell count: NA
    * Tested pH offline: 7.55 
    * Prepared sample for offline biochemistry analyses: NA 
      * 250uL taken from sample
      * diluted 1:2 with equal volume of dH2O (not PBS) 
      * Quick spin for 1 minute
      * Reserve supernatant in new 1.5mL tube and discarded pellet. Input sample info into datasheet here for later analysis offsite. Stored in sample box at -20degC
  8. Sprayed sample tube end and cap with 70% ethanol, re-attached cap.

### Observations/Summary: Seed was around 2000k cells/mL, seed fraction was
around 10%, therefore day 0 cell count expected to be 200k cells/mL - unknown
why this difference
