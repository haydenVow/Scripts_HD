### Process:

  1. Took image of vessel with microscope on phase setting.
  2. Aliquotted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath for a minimum of 20 minutes prior to use
  3. Removed vessel(s) from the incubator
  4. Washed the vessel(s) with dPBS (warmed).
  5. Added    10    mL tryple to each vessel/well and incubated at 37˚C for 12 min, checking every few min until >90% of cells were detatched.
  6. Neutralised with    10      dPBS and combined cell suspension into      50ml   tubes.
  7. Centrifuged at 500 x g for 5 min.
  8. Aspirated the supernatant(s).
  9. Resuspended pellet(s) in      5 mL       DMEM/F12 + 10% FBS  media
  10. Took 40ul sample from each line, and performed cell count

  16. Cell suspensions transferred to cryovials, 1mL/1M cells/vial
  17. Cryovials transferred to pre-chilled Mr. Frosty, and placed in -80 freezer.  
  




Observations/Summary:  
550,000 cells of each cell line seeded into T75s, the remaining cells banked
as an MCB
