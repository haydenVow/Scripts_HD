Passaged clones by hand from culture 12388. whole well images of clones were
imaged using the Zaber imaging system, exposure 14ms under PHASE.

Those that appeared 70-100% confluent were selected for passage. Breifly,  

  1. Wells were washed with 200uL of dPBS 
  2. dPBS was removed and 100uL of Tryple-EDTA was added
  3. Cells were incubated for 10 minutes at 30 degrees, 5% CO2.
  4. 20uL of Tryple + cell mixture was transferred into a fresh well containing 200uL of growth media on a new 96 well plate (DMEM/F12+20% FBS+1xP/S) 

The new culture was transferred to incubator 140, Culture 12571. Clone
tracking details can be found in this document.
