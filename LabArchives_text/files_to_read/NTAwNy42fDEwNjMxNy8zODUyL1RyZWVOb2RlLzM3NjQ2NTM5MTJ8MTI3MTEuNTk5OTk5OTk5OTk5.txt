The science team has experienced many cell deaths between May to September
2021. Many of these incidents have occurred when using E6 media or ACF media
that contain many of the same growth factors. In particular, the Gains and
Heavy Chain team has encountered cell death consecutively on several of their
experiments within Electrical Stimulation, DSD and Bradford and Lowry assay
when using E6 media. More details on cell death can be found in the excel
sheet.

It was discussed that E6 media was a likely cause for cell death as many of
the cells in the different experiments died within a few days of each other
after being fed with the same E6 media. This is somewhat unexpected given the
amount of successful experiments that have been run in Vow prior to these
incidents, however, given the recent cell death, all of which have linked back
to E6 media, this is the likely cause. It is not certain what has caused the
E6 to have a negative effect on the cells. Some possible reasons include:

  * Refrigeration temperature being too high 
  * Freeze thaw of growth factors having a negative effect 
  * Expiry or damage to one of the growth factor components  

Therefore, to confirm that E6 media is indeed the cause for cell death in our
experiments, this study will compare DOLLY12 cells that have been cultured in
E6 media and a control (DMEM/F12 + 2%HS) for a duration of 14 days.
