Cell Staining to check for cell growth on BioNOC carriers (D1):

*Images saved under flask 10748

For this day 2 types of methods for staining were compared:

  1. Cells fixed and dehydrated with ethanol and then stained with DAPI
  2. Cells fixed with PFA and then stained with DAPI

Procedure:

* All solutions were added at a volume of 1mL to each well

Ethanol Method: (1) flask from each seeding condition

Flask IDs:  
15,000cells/cm2 - 10748-CHOMP07-Crocodile P7-6of6  
5,000cells/cm2 - 10746-CHOMP07-Crocodile P7-4of6  
7,500cells/cm2 - 10743-CHOMP07-Crocodile P7-1of6

  1. 1x BioNOC was removed from each (1) flask and placed in a 24 well plate. 
  2. Ethanol (70%) was added to each well at 15:22 (10min)
  3. Ethanol was washed off at 15:32 with dPBS for 5 min
  4. DAPI (1:1000) in dPBS was then added at 15:39
  5. DAPI was then removed and a dPBS wash was performed for 5 min at 15:44
  6. This dPBS was then removed and the wells were filled with fresh dPBS at 15:49

This dPBS was later removed during imaging because the macrocarriers were
found to move around too much in the liquid during imaging. It was also harder
to get clear images of the macrocarriers in the liquid. The dPBS was re-added
to the well after imaging for storage in the fridge.

PFA Method: (2) flask from each seeing condition

Flask IDs:  
5,000cells/cm2 - 10745-CHOMP07-Crocodile P7-3of6  
15,000cells/cm2 - 10747-CHOMP07-Crocodile P7-5of6  
7,500cells/cm2 - 10744-CHOMP07-Crocodile P7-2of6

  1. 2x dPBS washes were performed one after the other at 15:22
  2. PFA was then added at 15:25 (10min)
  3. PFA was then removed and the macrocarrier washed with dPBS for 5 min at 15:37
  4. A second dPBS wash was then performed for 5 min at 15:40
  5. DAPI (1:1000) in dPBS was then added at 15:44 (5min)
  6. DAPI was then removed and a dPBS wash was performed for 5min at 15:50
  7. This dPBS was then removed and the wells filled with fresh dPBS at 15:54

This dPBS was later removed during imaging because the macrocarriers were
found to move around too much in the liquid during imaging. It was also harder
to get clear images of the macrocarriers in the liquid. The dPBS was re-added
to the well after imaging for storage in the fridge.

Results:

  * The PFA condition did not work. Very few cells were visible in any of the conditions. Cells may have been detached from the carrier during the staining process
  * The ethanol method worked well. Cells were very visible in all conditions. Next time I will try a simpler method with less dPBS washes to see how this compares.
  * All seeding conditions had visible cells. However, there are very few cells visible in the 5000cells/cm2 condition, possibly due to the low seeding density or reduced cell growth as a result of this. Plenty of cells were visible in both the 7,500cells/cm2 and 15,000cells/cm2 conditions with the 15000cells/cm2 visibly having the most cells.
  * Z-stack images were attempted but I could not locate the files afterwards. The images below are from random groups in each staining condition taken on the Axio Microscope.
