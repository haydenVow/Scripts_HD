  * Washed out the mixing tank with ~10-15L of water and turned of recirculation pump for a few minutes, then drained this water
  * Filled tank up with 593L of water before we realised the water tanks were empty. Adding the powder brought the weight up to 603kg, the remaining 97L of water were filled with MilliQ from the lab. 
    * Powder added around 10:30 and re-circulation and stirring kept on for the majority of the time
  * Still some powder particles in the mix at 13:00 even after adding the extra MilliQ water
  * Started filtering at 13:45 as we couldn't see a way to finish dissolving the powder. Thought that powder had possibly settled in the sample line and that's why we kept getting powder in the sample.
  * No issues with filter blocking however there was a fair bit of powder that poured out of the filter after filtration was complete and the filter was dissembled. 
  * 2 carboys of media (20L) were taken into the lab to be filtered and used for lab work
    * These aliquots also contained a fair amount of undissolved powder
  * 615L of the media mix were filtered in the STR2000
  * The remaining 65L of media was filtered into a palletank bag already containing 75:25 RPMI:HyCell that had been made up on 08/06
    * This will be used to seed and top up the STR200
