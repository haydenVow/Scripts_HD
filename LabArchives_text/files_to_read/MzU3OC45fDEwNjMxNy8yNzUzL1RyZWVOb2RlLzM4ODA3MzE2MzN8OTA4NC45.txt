1\. Aliquotted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then
placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath for a minimum of 20 minutes
prior to use:

  *  Growth media (for seeding):    60 mL 
  * Time that aliquot was placed in the water bath to warm before use:   10:07 

  




## Thaw and seed vial:

2\. Collected the cryovial from Liquid Nitrogen storage & place in foam
floater in water bath for 5 min  10:25 - 10:30

Location where cryovial was collected from:

Vial details:  2   x  DOLLY12 Fibroblast  cryovials at   1000K  cells each for
a total of   2000K  cells

`3. Ethanol sprayed & transferred the vial(s) to the BSC.`

`4.  Added  500 µL of Growth Media (to generate a total volume of 1mL in the
cryovial) to the cryovial, resuspended the cell suspension gently to reduce
osmotic shock. `

`5. Collected the entire 1mL of cell suspension & transfer into the pre-warmed
tube of Growth Media. `

`6. Using a 10mL serological pipette, resuspended & distributed the cells
evenly in the  60 mL of pre-warmed Growth Media (prepared in Step 2). `

`7. Transfered  30 mL to each  T175  flask`

`8. Transfered flask/plate(s) to incubate at: `

  * [x]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (aviary cells)

  

Making labels

Note - You will need to increase the passage number by one. (i.e. if your
thawed vial ID has a passage number of 3, when you make a culture ID for you
vessel you will need change the passage number to 4 on Airtable.)
