Process

For buffer preparation and assay protocol specifics, please see experimental
plan entry  

  1. Prepared unknown samples to 1mg/mL final concentration and spiked with IGF-LR3. G-sheet with sample preparation and plate layout here 
  2. Prepared wash buffer
  3. Reserved unused wells from plate frame and stored in plate packaging 
  4. Prepared standards in RIPA buffer as per manufacturer's recommendations
  5. Added 100uL standards and unknown samples to plate, careful not to touch. Sealed with provided plate seal sticker
  6. Started incubation at 37degC 11:22 AM 
  7. Retrieved from incubator at 12:40 PM
  8. Removed liquid from wells and immediately added 100uL per well of detection reagent A
  9. Returned to incubator at 12:45 PM
  10. Retrieved from incubator at 13:47 PM
  11. Aspirated solution, rinsed with 350uL per well wash solution 3 times. Blotted excess
  12. Added 100uL per well detection reagent B, covered with plate sealer
  13. Returned to incubator at  14:02 PM (30 mins)
  14. Retrieved from incubator at 14:30 PM
  15. Aspirated solution, rinsed with 350uL/well wash solution 5 times. Blotted excess
  16. Added 90uL per well detection substrate solution, covered with plate sealer. Added at Incubation time 10-20 minutes. Check plate every 5 minutes and inspect colour change. 14:54 Stopped when curve resolved with distinctive gradient after 15 minutes
  17. Added 50uL per well Stop solution. Gently tapped plate to ensure uniform mixing
  18. Ensured plate bottom was clear of marks/droplets and no bubbles in wells 
  19. Read absorbance at 450nm in plate reader
  20. See attached for exported data
  21. See G-sheet for standard curve and data summary

  




Observations, notes & summary

  * incubation time for TMB substrate was 15 minutes (protocol specified variable period between 10-20 mins) before stop solution was added
  * IGF-LR3 spiked condition was accidentally prepared at 10x desired concentration (see data G-sheet). This is not problematic - purpose of the spike was to demonstrate that kit could detect IGF-LR3 variant in addition to wild-type. Large spike in absorbance reading for this condition compared to non-spiked condition is indicative of this, even if absorbance reading was outside the window of relative values in standard curve
  * 50ng/mL concentration is too high for a standard, and absorbance was outside of the linear range of the kit. Removed this point from the standard curve with 25ng/mL as the highest, and R^2 of trendline was 0.995. Therefore, 25ng/mL is acceptable as upper limit for standard curve concentration
  * IGF concentration was ~3.0 higher than IGF concentration in quail meat. Not yet determined how this compared to published values for comparable tissue. Unclear if background contributed to these levels of absorbance.
