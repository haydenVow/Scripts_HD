Process- Blood smear and DAPI stain.

  1. Pool the media from each well of the cultures listed bellow into 1 x 15ml tube (we want to combine all the cultures together so that we have enough cells to look at)
    1. The total volume was 4 mL
  2. Centrifuge at 650xg for 5min 13:33 - 13:38
  3. Remove supernatant and re-suspend cells in 200uL of PBS
  4. Place a drop of cell suspension onto each of 3x microscope slides (just doing a few of them in case it doesn't work great). 
  5. Using another slide, smear the fluid across to create a film (See diagram bellow ).
  6. Allow to air dry. 
  7.  ~~Add a drop (50 uL) of~~ Wash slide with 4% PFA using transfer pipette, sufficient to cover the surface of the smear and allow to fix for 10 minutes.
    1. Slide 1: 14:00 - 14:15
    2. Slide 2: 14:07 - 14:21
  8. Remove the PFA by sucking it away from the slide with a pipette. 
  9. Wash the slide 2x with PBS. 
  10. Add a drop of PBS + 1% DAPI and allow to stain for 5 min. 
    1. #1 14:20 - 14:25
    2. #2 14:23 - 14:28
  11. Remove Dapi and wash slide 2 times with PBS.
  12. Place a fresh cover slip on the slide.
  13. Image slide at 10 and 20x on both DAPI and phase contrast. 
  14. These cultures can be discarded once staining + Imaging has been completed.

Drops did not spread on the smeared slides at any step. Manually spreading the
droplets with a pipet tip solved this issue. However, for future attempts,
recommend making up a separate specimen jar of each reagent for each step,
then dipping the entire slide in the solution. This would prevent disturbing
the smear on the surface of the slide during processing.
