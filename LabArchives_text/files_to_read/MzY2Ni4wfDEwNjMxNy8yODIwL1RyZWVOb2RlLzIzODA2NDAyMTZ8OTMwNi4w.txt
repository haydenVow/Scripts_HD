RELATED TO MILESTONE:  

Q3 SCC objective: generate 3 production ready cell lines

Q3 SCC KR2: Evaluate >30 000 cells per month starting September 1st

AIM/PURPOSE: To create a OpenTrons protocol for passaging cells from 384 well
plates to 96 well plates.

HYPOTHESIS: N/A

RESULTS SUMMARY:

See this Notion page for a summary: https://www.notion.so/vow/Automated-clone-
picking-passaging-protocols-for-adherent-
cultures-7e56e02c557e4e09a6a2fd0c7e8132d7

Automated clone picking/passaging protocols were developed for passaging from
384 wp -> 96 wp -> 24 dwp -> 6 wp.

24 -> 6 wp protocol still needs optimisation as many cells remain attached to
the 24 wp.

CONCLUSIONS: N/A

NEXT STEPS:

Using deck heaters to have a faster protocol by reducing Tryple incubation
and/or passaging more wells in 1 run.

Graphical user interface for generating a multi-well protocol from a 1-well
protocol to make it easier for scientists to use without any coding.

Testing Hoechst staining and passaging protocols on different cell lines and
species.

 Making automating clone picking/passaging protocols for a suspension cloning
pipeline (see Q4 PPP experiments).
