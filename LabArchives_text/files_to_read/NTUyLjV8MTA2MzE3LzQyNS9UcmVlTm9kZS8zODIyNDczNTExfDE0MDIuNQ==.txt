1\. Remove the E125 (ID: 6459-DOLLY12-Sheep P10-1of1) flask from the shaker
plate and place into the BSC.

2\. Take two separate 10ul aliquot samples for two cell count.

Note: Prior to taking aliquots shake the E125 flask in a similar manner to the
plate shaker to avoid fibroblast aggregation whilst into solution.  

3\. Perform both cell counts using the heamocytometer.

  1. Cell count 1: 7,560,000   

  2. Cell count 2: 6,720,000   

Average: 7,140,000

4\. Return   E125    flask to incubator and shake at 100 RPM.

Observations:

\- Visible fibroblast aggregates present in the solution
