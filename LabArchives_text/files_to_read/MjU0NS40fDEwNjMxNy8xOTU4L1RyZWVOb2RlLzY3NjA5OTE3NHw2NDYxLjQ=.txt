18-JuneEquilibrate 3xE125 flasks and 6x50mL bioreactor tubes with Cytodex 1
microcarriers. Equilibrate all vessels with 4.5mg/mL of cytodex 1
microcarriers (19,350 carriers/mL), from 20g/L stock.  
  
30mL for E125 flasks (90mL total), 10mL for 50mL tubes (60mL total).  
  
DMEM/F12 + 20% FBS + 1xP/S + 10uM p38i + 1% w/v poloxomer 188 growth media.  
  
18-JuneSeed all 9 vessels with DOLLY12 cells Seed each vessel at 67725cells/mL
(3.5 cells per carrier)  
  
Shake 3x50mL tubes at ~250rpm  
Shake 3x50mL tubes at critical shaking speed (to be determined bye eye as the
speed in which the carriers go from resting state to suspension, incremental
speed increase necessary to determine).  
  
Shake E125 flasks at standard 110rpm.  
19-JuneSample, Stain and Image samples from each vessel, 3x20uL from each
vessel. Use the Zaber for imaging under PHASE and DAPI channels, 1 image on
centre of each well. Process using MIA captures 'uCarrier cell count' tool.  
  
Mix samples with dPBS containing 1% w/v poloxamer 188 and 20uL/mL of Hoechst
33342 and wait 20 minutes before imaging. (100uL max volume prior to imaging)/  
  
Take whole well images as well to confirm carrier numbers in each vessel.  
20-June50% Feed all vessels Growth media feed, same as seed media.  
  
5mL for 50mL tubes, 15mL for E125 flasks.  
21-Juneno action  
  
22-25 JuneSample, Stain and Image samples from each vessel, 3x20uL from each
vessel.  
Use the Zaber for imaging under PHASE and DAPI channels, 1 image on centre of
each well. Process using MIA captures 'uCarrier cell count' tool.  
  
Mix samples with dPBS containing 1% w/v poloxamer 188 and 20uL/mL of Hoechst
33342 and wait 20 minutes before imaging.  
  
Feed tubes/flasks with a 50% media change on the 23rd.  
28-30th-JuneAnalyse proliferation data to determine doubling rates.
