Aim/Purpose


Determine if the type of water (MilliQ [Type 1 water] vs bottled ultrapure vs
RO [type 3 water]) used to reconstitute the Hycell CHO media affects the
survival and subsequent proliferation of CHO-S cells


Hypothesis


No negative differences in CHO-S survival and proliferation will be observed
between Hycell media reconstituted in each of the water treatment conditions.


Technical Gap


All commercially available media powders used at Vow are reconstituted in
MilliQ (Type 1) water. It is unclear whether CHO-S can survive in growth media
reconstituted in reverse osmosis water or bottled ultrapure water. This
experiment will determine whether the water used to reconstitute powdered
growth media affects cell survival and proliferation.


Method/Procedure


Process:

  1. Prepare 150 mL of Hycell media in each water treatment (MilliQ, bottled ultrapure and reverse osmosis)
    1. Add 25.4 g/L of Hycell CHO powder, 2.2 g/L of sodium bicarbonate and 1 g/L of poloxamer 188
    2. Stir until dissolved
    3. Sterile filter through a 0.22 um filter unit
  2. Determine electrical conductivity and pH of each sample
  3. Seed 3x E125 flasks with CHO-S cells (1x vial at 10M cells, 3.3M cells per flask)
    1. Condition 1: Hycell media with MilliQ (Type 1 water)
    2. Condition 2: Hycell media with bottled UltraPure
    3. Condition 3: Hycell media with reverse osmosis (Type 3 water)
  4. Perform a cell count approximately 24 hours after seeding to assess cell survival
  5. Passage the cells 4 days after seeding and retrieve samples for a total cell count and viability for each condition
  6. Allow the cells to remain in culture for an additional 4 days and perform a final cell count and viability check for each condition
