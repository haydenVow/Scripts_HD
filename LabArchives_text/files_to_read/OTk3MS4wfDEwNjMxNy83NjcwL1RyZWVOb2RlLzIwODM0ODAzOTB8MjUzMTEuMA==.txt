 OptiPRO + 4mM Glutamax  M10148  
  
  
  




Process:

1\. Aliquotted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then
placed all aliquots to warm in 37C water bath for a minimum of 20 minutes
prior to use:

  1.  Growth media (for seeding):    120mL 

2\. Collected the cryovial from Liquid Nitrogen storage & place in foam
floater in water bath for approx 3 min (until just thawed)

Location where cryovial was collected from:

 Homer  OR Dewer 1

Tower/Bucket # 4

Box/Cane # 6

Vial location: D8

Vial ID(s): 14166




3\. Ethanol sprayed & transferred the vial(s) to the BSC.

4\. Added  500µL of Growth Media to the cryovial, resuspended the cell
suspension gently to reduce osmotic shock.

5\. Collected the cell suspension & transfer into the pre-warmed tube of
Growth Media




6\. Using a 25mL serological pipette, resuspended & distributed the cells
evenly in the   120mL of pre-warmed Growth Media (prepared in Step 2).

7\. Seeded cells into (non-gelatin coated) flasks/wells at approximately 6430k
cells per cm2.

8\. Transfered   30mL to each  T175  flask/well.

9\. Transfered flask/plate(s) to incubate at:

  * [ x]  37ºC, 5% CO2, library lab, incubator 160




SOPs used:

  * SOP_Thawing Cells Into Adherent Culture V_02
