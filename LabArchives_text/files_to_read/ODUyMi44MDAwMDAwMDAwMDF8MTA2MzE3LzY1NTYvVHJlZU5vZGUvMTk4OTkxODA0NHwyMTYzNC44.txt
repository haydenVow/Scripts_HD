Took samples

  1. Sprayed down the sample line end with 70% ethanol.
  2. Connected a 5 mL sterile syringe.
  3. Withdrew 1 mL (to purge the line), discarded
  4. Connected a fresh sterile syringe and withdrew 1 mL of sample.
  5. Disconnected sample syringe and transferred 1 mL of sample each to 1.5 mL Eppendorf tubes for cell count
  6. Sprayed sample line with 70% ethanol.
  7. Performed cell count:
    1. 136 million cells total (64,200 cells/mL)

NotesAlmost 50% of the cells appear to have been lost during seeding (pre-seed
count was 220 million cells)  
  
  
  
  




### Observations/Summary:

  * see 'Notes' in table above - cell count ~halved from initial seeding to sampling from vessel. This may be due to cells lost in tubing/seeding bottle. Alternatively may be due to large differences in final culture volume (increased volume increased error). Will monitor
