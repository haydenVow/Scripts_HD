RELATED TO MILESTONE:  

Milestone 3A: 10x doublings on microcarriers in ACF

AIM/PURPOSE: To test an animal-component free medium for long-term culture of
primary muscle stem cells which consists of E8 media + albumin. To test a new
passaging protocol using this medium which involves the delayed addition of
albumin after passaging.

HYPOTHESIS: E8 + albumin combined with the delayed addition of albumin will
result in better doubling times than our existing ACF media (E810C).

RESULTS SUMMARY:

None of the ACF media conditions (including our E810C control) allowed cell
survival and growth. Further investigation into ACF media ingredients is
needed to identify the cause.

CONCLUSIONS: The hypothesis was not supported.

NEXT STEPS:

The experiment should be repeated using reagents that the authors used where
possible and using our bovine cell lines. It should also include the use of 6
well plates or T25 flasks for continuous culture, rather than 24 well plates.
