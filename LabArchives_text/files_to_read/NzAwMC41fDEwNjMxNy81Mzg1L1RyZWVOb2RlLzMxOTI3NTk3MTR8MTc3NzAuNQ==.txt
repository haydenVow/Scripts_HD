Process (Preparing MC solution):

1\. Prepare 1% MC solution by heating up 100 mL of MilliQ water in a Schott
bottle to 80'C and adding the MC powder (1g) slowly.

2\. Mix the solution vigorously frequently to ensure adequate dispersion of
the MC particles throughout the liquid. A white precipitate should form.

3\. Once fully dispersed submerge the Schott bottle in room temperature water
(tap water is fine) and vigorously shake the bottle whilst cooling. MC
dissolves in cold water however it is first necessary to heat up the powder as
it forms a gel when coming in contact with cold water, drastically reducing
the effective surface area for slowing the diffusion of water into the powder.

4\. Sterile filter solution and dilute to the required concentration using
growth media.




Process:

1\. Aliquotted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then
placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath for a minimum of 20 minutes
prior to use:

  1. TrypLE:       mL in       tubes
  2. dPBS (for neutralising)       mL in        tubes
  3. Growth media (for pellet resuspension):       mL in        tubes
  4. Growth media (for seeding):       mL in        tubes
  5. Times that all aliquots were placed in the water bath to warm before use    :  a/pm 

Note: if aliquots were placed in water bath at different times, record the
time stamp for each individual solution.




2\. Washed the flask(s) with dPBS.

3\. Added       mL tryple to each vessel/well and incubated at 37˚C for
min.

Note: Fibroblasts typically require 15-18 minutes of incubation with tryple,
slightly longer than MuSCs.

  1. Start/Finish time for centrifugation was    :    \-    :   a/pm

4\. Neutralised with       dPBS (warmed) and combined cell suspension into a
tube.

5\. Centrifuged at 650 x g for 5 min

  1. Start/Finish time for centrifugation was    :    \-    :  a/pm 




6\. Aspirated the supernatant(s)

7\. Resuspended pellet(s) in        mL       media.

8\. Performed a cell count using the haemocytometer and recorded the cell
count data in widget or the Google Doc spreadsheet called 'Cell Count
Spreadsheet' (see link below):

9\. Total cell number was:  

10\. Seeded ~7k cells per cm2 of the flasks/plates. Note that fibroblasts
prefer to be subcultured closely together.

11\. Volume of cell suspension required for subculture was:  

12\. Transfer    µL of cell suspension to the pre-warmed   mL Growth Media.

13\. Transfer cell suspension into (non-gelatin coated)         flasks/plates.

14\. Transfer flask/plate(s) to incubate at:

  * [ ]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (aviary cells)
