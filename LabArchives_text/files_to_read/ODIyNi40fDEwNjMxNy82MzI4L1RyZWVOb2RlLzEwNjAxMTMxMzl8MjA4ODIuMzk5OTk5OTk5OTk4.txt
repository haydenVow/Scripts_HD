Our current medium formulation for CHOMP fibroblasts in suspension is HyCell
CHO + 20% KSR + 1xP/S + 4mM Glutamax + 100ng/mL IGF-LR3 + b-FGF + 1:100 ACA.
The Nuvonis quail suspension line we have acquired is grown in Freestyle 293 +
1g/L Yeast Extract + 20mg/L L-Ornithine monohydrochloride + 20mg/L Putrescine
dihydrochloride + 50 ug/L IGF-LR3 + 10 ug/L EGF + 1:100 ACA. Given this
Nuvonis cell line has been adapted to suspension and therefore this medium is
known to support growth in suspension conditions, we would like to test
whether it is effective at enabling CHOMP fibroblasts to adapt to and grow in
suspension culture. Furthermore, reptilian cells have more in common with
avian cells than mammalian cells, and so basing our medium formulation off an
avian cell line makes more sense than our current approach of basing it off
what worked for a mammalian (sheep) cell line.
