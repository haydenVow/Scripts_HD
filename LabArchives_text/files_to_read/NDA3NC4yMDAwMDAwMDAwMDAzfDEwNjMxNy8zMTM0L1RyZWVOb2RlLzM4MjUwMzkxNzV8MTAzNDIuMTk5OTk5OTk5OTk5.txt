Aim/Purpose


1\. To enrich the fibroblast portion of our F_NANDO3 cells by expanding the
plastic adherent component of our raw isolate.

2\. To expand these cells to a master cell bank followed by a WCB


Hypothesis


1\. Continuous culture of our plastic adherent F_NANDO3  cells will allows us
to bank >1m million cells as a MCB followed by an expansion to >20M cells for
WCB.

  


Technical Gap


1\. F_NANDO3  is a chicken biopsy recently isolated by Vow. As these cells
have yet to be expanded to MCB, we have no prior indication of the health and
proliferative capacity of these cells.

2\. As we are working with raw isolate, the plastic adherent cell population
is also likely to be a non-homogenous, mixed-cell population, and is unlikely
to be comprised solely of fibroblasts.

  


Method/Procedure


Experimental Plan Raw Isolate to MCB  
  
1\. Thaw raw isolate of NANDO03  

  * Warm an aliquot of DMEM/F12 + 10% FBS + 1x PS (growth media). 
  * 1 x vial of frozen cell isolate from F_NANDO3  will be thawed and plated into 1x 6 well plate. Non-coated plates will be used to aid preferential selection of fibroblasts. Incubate at 37 degrees C and 5% CO2.
  * 4 hours after seeding, the seeding media containing unattached cells will be removed, and replaced with fresh growth media. 

2\. Monitor/ feed plastic adherent NANDO3 ells

  * Perform daily imaging of the plate & write observations regarding cell proliferation and morphology.
  * Perform a 50% feed with  DMEM/F12 + 10% FBS + 1x PS approximately every 72 hours. 

3\. Expansion passages

  * When cells appear 80-90% confluent, passage following SOP_Passaging Adherent Cells V_04 using non-coated culture vessels.
  * Cells should be seeded back into plates at approximately 7500 cells/cm2.

4\. Passage and seed cells for immunostaining + Bank master cell bank of
plastic adherent KOZCO20 cells.

  * When cell numbers are sufficient to be 90% confluent across approximately 4x T175 flasks (700cm/2), bank cells as a MCB following Banking-Template_V2 .

Experimental Plan MCB to WCB  
  

1\. Thaw F_NANDO03 MCB  

  * Warm an aliquot of DMEM/F12 + 10% FBS + 1x PS (growth media). 
  * 1 x vial of frozen F_NANDO3  MCB will be thawed and plated into 1x 6 well plate. Incubate at 37 degrees C and 5% CO2.

2\. Monitor/ feed plastic adherent F_NANDO3 ells

  * Perform a 50% feed with  DMEM/F12 + 10% FBS + 1x PS approximately every 72 hours. Image flasks on feed days

3\. Expansion passages

  * When cells appear 80-90% confluent, passage following SOP_Passaging Adherent Cells V_04 using non-coated culture vessels.
  * Cells should be seeded back into plates at approximately 7500 cells/cm2.

4\. Passage and seed cells for immunostaining + Bank master cell bank of
F_NANDO3 cells.

  * When cell numbers are sufficient to be 90% confluent across a 10CF, bank cells as a WCB following Banking-Template_V2 .
