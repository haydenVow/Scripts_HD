Aim


To further explore the occurrence of the plugs (hence known as "pork buns")
that resulted from the autoclaving of a biogel formulation (2% Alginate, 1%
Xanthan, 1% Glucomannan, 2% Methocellulose).

Main goals:  
\- Recreate the incidence of the "plugs"

\- Determine how they are formed

\- See if the scale can be increased

\- Determine how long they take to rehydrate completely


Hypothesis


When the biogel is placed in the oven with steam, the biogel bubbles up and
forms a foam like plug. This can be recreated by putting the biogel in a
shallow wide dish and allowed to full bake.


Method


Pork Bun Gel Creation

1\. Weigh out all biomaterial powders (see below) and combine together into a
homogenous powder.

\- 2% (w/v) Low viscosity alginate

\- 2% (w/v)  Metho cellulose (Sigma Aldrich Brand)

\- 1% (w/v) Xanthan Gum

\- 1% (w/v) Glucomannan

2.Hydrate various biomaterials in PBS. Stir with a spatula until mostly
dissolved. If clumps form, try pushing against the side of the jar.

3\. Leave for 1hr in room temperature

4\. Stir to ensure a homogenous biogel, incorporate air in to form bubbles

6\. Refrigerate remaining gel overnight at 4C (Note: The Pork Bun Creation
method was tested using biogel that had and had not been refrigerated
overnight)

  

Pork Bun Creation

1\. 40 g of biogel were placed into one 190mL jar (silicon lid)

2\. 15g g of biogel was placed into a circular cutter which was sitting in a
pie tin

2\. Water was poured into the ovens steaming water container

3\. The containers were placed into the oven making sure the lids were
loosened/lightly placed on top

4\. The oven was turned on and set to cook at 120 C for 30 minutes
(temperature and time varied)

5\. Containers were removed from the oven

6\. Specimens were removed from the containers and analysed

Pork Bun Creation Results

Observations

160 C, 100% Humidity, 30 minutes

Container / SpecimenImage(s)Notes  
15g of biogel in pie tin with circular cutter  
Produced crisp and light specimen. Smell and taste caramel/toffee-like.
Temperature too high for pork bun consistency, also Schott Jar cannot
withstand this temperature limiting vessel type.  
  
120 C, 100% Humidity, 20 minutes

Container / SpecimenImage(s)Notes  
40g of biogel in 190 mL Silicon Lid JarProduced specimen with similar shape
and colour to those created from autoclaving and pressure cooker. However
inside texture was significantly softer and specimen did not hold together
well after segmenting. Also developed crispier exterior to other creation
methods.

40g of biogel in 190 mL Silicon Lid Jar  
Produced specimen with similar shape and colour to those created from
autoclaving and pressure cooker. However inside texture was still softer and
specimen did not hold together well after segmenting. Also developed crispier
exterior to other creation methods.  
  
Additionally during creation biogel bubbled up and caused the silicon lid to
slip off. This bubbling seems to have spread a thin layer of biogel onto the
sides of the jar which caused a dry, thin, skin/film to form.

Conclusion


Oven with steam can be used to produce 'pork bun' specimens similar to those
created in the autoclave/pressure cooker. However, the inside texture of these
specimens was significantly softer and as such they did not hold together well
after segmenting. They also developed a crispier exterior. Further development
is required to achieve a better texture. Suggestions include further varying
the cooking time and temperature.
