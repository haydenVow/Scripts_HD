13\. Gelatin coated 2 x 96 well plates and left to incubate for one hour.

Obtained a 15mL cell suspension of 1.5M (approx) cells from Kylie.

Transferred     50   µl of cell suspension to each well of the two 96 well
plates.

14\. Topped up each well with 100uL of growth media to make total volume to
150uL.  

15\. Left at RT in the BSC for 30 min to allow cells to settle.

16\. Transferred vessel(s) to incubate in the bottom Sanyo incubator at:  

  * [X]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (avian cells)




Observations/Summary:

  * Cells taken from cell expansion passage and 2 x 96 well plates were seeded at 5000 cells/well.

Version Change Log

NameChange Details  
V1 (original)N/A  
V2Changed all sentences to past tense to better reflect a hand-written lab
book entry.  
Various formatting changes.  
Addition of more detail to step 2, removal of step 3. Replaced volume
requirements table with updated volumes @Sep 22, 2020  
Updated temperature selection for mammalian/aviary cells @Sep 23, 2020  
V3Included a section for 'vessel type' in passage ID table Replace
'flask/plate' with 'vessel' throughout lab book Include at step 1 to take
image of vessel on the microscope  
Mentioned that dPBS for washing should be warm - step 3(2) and 5.  
Added timepoint at step 4 for when vessel is removed from incubator  
Include at step 11 to aliquot cell resuspension into microcentrifuge tube  
Included at step 10 and 13 time point for when cell pellet is resuspended and
when resuspended cells is moved into growth media.  
Included p38i in table of regent used  
Combined two dPBS entries in 'Media/reagents' table Added 'cell density per
vessel'
