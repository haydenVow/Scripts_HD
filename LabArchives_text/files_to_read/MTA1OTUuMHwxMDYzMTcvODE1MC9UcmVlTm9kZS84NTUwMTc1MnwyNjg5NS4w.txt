Process:

Aliquoted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then
placed all aliquots to warm in the cell culture incubator 40 minutes prior to
use

  1. TrypLE:   15    mL 
  2. dPBS (for washing & neutralising)   30    mL
  3. Growth media (for pellet resuspension):       mL (of each media)
  4. Growth media (for seeding):    100   mL (of each media)
  5. Washed the flask(s) with 5mL dPBS.
  6. Added   5   mL tryple to each vessel/well and incubated at 37˚C for   10     min.
  7. Neutralised with   5mL    dPBS (warmed) and combined cell suspension into a     50ml  tube (per cell line).
  8. Centrifuged at approx. 500 x g for 5 min.
  9.  Aspirated the supernatant(s)
  10. Resuspended pellet(s) in      5  mL     respective growth  medias.  
Performed a cell count using the haemocytometer and recorded the cell count
data in widget or the Google Doc spreadsheet called 'Cell Count Spreadsheet'
(see link below):

  11. Total cell number was:  
KHAKIO: 11,750,000  
KHAKIK: 4,520,000  
KHAKIF: 4,080,000

  12. Each culture was re-seeded into 2x T175 flasks, with 30mL of their respective growth medias per flask 

  13. Transferred flasks to incubate at 37ºC, 5% CO2 in our Binder cell culture incubator at Co-Labs, 17/306 Albert St, Brunswick.
