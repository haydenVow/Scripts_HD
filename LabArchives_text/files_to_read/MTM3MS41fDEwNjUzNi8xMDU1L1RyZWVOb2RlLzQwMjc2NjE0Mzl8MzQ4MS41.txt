50% Feed on 32x10CS and 16x5CS


# Procedure - Feed

# Note: Fibroblasts do NOT require Gelatin coated Flasks, and do NOT require
p38i.  

  1. Turn on the water bath and set to 32'C.
  2. Aliquot  required growth media into a sterile container/s and place into the water bath. 
  3. Place in the water bath and heat for at least 20 minutes.
  4. Observe the cell flasks for confluence under the microscope using 4 x magnification and take images as required. Note: The confluence of cells must be <90% to perform cell feeding.
  5. Transfer flasks to the BSC and remove required volume of media from each flask (according to the Table below).
  6. Replace the same volume into each flask with the prepared growth media.
  7. Return the flasks to the incubators
