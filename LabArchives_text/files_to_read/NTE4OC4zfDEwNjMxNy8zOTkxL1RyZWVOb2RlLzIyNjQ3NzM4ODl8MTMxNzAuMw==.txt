## Thaw and seed vial:

  1.  36mL DMEM + 20% FBS + 1 x PS placed in water bath set to 30C 15:45  

Collected the cryovial from Liquid Nitrogen storage & place in foam floater in
water bath for 5 min  : - : a/pm

Location where cryovial was collected from:  
3424-Culture-7972-Vial-1of3  
3428-Culture-7972-Vial-1of3  
3431-Culture-7972-Vial-1of3

Vial details:   3 cryovials at   500K  cells each.

  1. ` Ethanol sprayed & transferred the vial(s) to the BSC.```
  2. `Added  500µL of Growth Media (to generate a total volume of 1mL in the cryovial) to the cryovial, resuspended the cell suspension gently to reduce osmotic shock. `
  3. `Took a 10ul sample from each vial for cell count  
`

  4. `Collected the entire 1mL of cell suspension & transfer into the pre-warmed tube of Growth Media (12mL per vial).`
  5. `Performed cell counts using trypan blue and manual counting with haemocytometer. Cell counts recorded here https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1DPzKubYxfHmWogVPihC-SSIBtIylyrBQE5kRX5Z8NtI/edit#gid=0`  
`TOTAL CELLS`  
`Vial 3431(FBS + DMSO) = 424K`  
`Vial 3428 (DMSO free Cryostor)=340K`  
`Vial 3424 (Cryostor)= 412K  
```

  6. ` Using a 10mL serological pipette, resuspended & distributed the cells evenly in the pre-warmed Growth Media ```
  7. `Transfered   12mL to each  T75 ```
  8. `Transfered flask/plate(s) to incubate at: 16:40`
