Procedure

  

### Note: Fibroblasts do NOT require Gelatin coated Flasks, and do NOT require
p38i.  
  

### Cell Harvest

  1. Turn on water bath and set temperature to 37C.
  2. Place new seeding flasks into the 37'C incubator to pre-warm.
  3. Take the flasks for harvest and observe under the microscope at 4x objective for even cell distribution . Refer to VSOP-006. Take 2-3 images per flask.
  4. Aliquot required volume of dPBS (37C), dPBS (ambient temp), TrypLE, and Growth Media in separate sterile pots. Refer to Table above for required volume.
  5. Place aliquots in pre-warmed water bath and leave for ~20 minutes or until warmed. Note: Ensure TrypLE is thoroughly warmed.  
`    Time stamp` : 9:30am

  6. Transfer aliquots and flasks required for harvest into the BSC.
  7. Discard growth media from each flask.
  8. Wash with warmed dPBS, then discard.
  9. Add TrypLE to each of the flasks. Mix thoroughly to ensure coverage of the surface area.
  10. Place in the incubator at 37C. After 8-10 minutes, remove flasks and observe for 95-100% dissociation of cells. Incubate further until maximum dissociation level is reached.  
`     Time stamps`:

    1.  14:52pm - 15:10pm (18 minutes)
    2.  14:53pm - 15:16pm (23 minutes)
  11. Aspirate the TrypLE solution and collect into 50mL centrifuge tubes(labelled).
  12. Using a serological pipette, dispense ambient temperature dPBS to create a final wash for each of the flasks. To effectively remove remaining cells adhered to the gelatin coated flasks,  aspirate the dPBS and resuspend into the the flask 2-3 times before collecting and combining the entire volume into the centrifuge tubes.
  13. Centrifuge at 650 x g for 5 minutes. ``  
`      Time stamp` :

    1.  15:20pm
    2.  15:28pm
  14. Gently remove centrifuge tubes from the machine, ensuring not to disturb the suspended pellets. Aspirate the supernatant from the tubes into fresh tubes. Remove as much remaining supernatant with a 1mL pipette, and resuspend cell pellets in 1mL media and combine into one suspension.  
Cells are now harvested.  

  15. For collected supernatant, spin at 1000 rcf for 5 mins

### Cell Count

  1. Following cell harvest and centrifugation, re-suspend the cell pellets. Use the table below to provide a rough estimation of the resuspension volume required.

### Cell Seeding

  1. Once cell counts are complete, combine the 2 cell suspensions from the harvest. Average total cell count and volume: 199,290,000 cells (live count) in 38.5mL
  2. Triturate the obtained cell suspension 10 times using a 25mL serological pipette to ensure a homogeneous cell suspension is obtained.
  3. Determine the required volume of suspension media (to achieve seeding density of about 30, 000 cells/cm2)  and dispense into pre-aliquoted growth media. Use Production Cell Count Calculator: VBLT-001.  
Type & No. of flasks seeded: 12xT175  
Seeding density: 31,633 cells/cm2  
Volume of cell suspension per flask: 1.07mL  
Media: PRF DMEM/F12  \+ 10% FBS for 9xT175, PRF DMEM/F12 + 20% FBS for 1xT175.

  4. Transfer flasks from the incubator into the BSC.
  5. Transfer required growth media + cells into each flask.  
`    Start time` : 16.45pm  

  6. Repeat the above step as many times as required until all flasks have been seeded with the media+cells.
  7. Transfer the flasks into the 37C incubator. Refer to Appendix 3 for incubation conditions.
