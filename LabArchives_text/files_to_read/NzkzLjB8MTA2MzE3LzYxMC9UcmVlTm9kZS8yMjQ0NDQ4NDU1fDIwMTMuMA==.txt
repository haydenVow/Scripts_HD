MTT STAINING PROTOCOL

Reagent Preparation (Example dilution is 75 mg MTT in 15 mL Diluent - so 5mg
of MTT per mL)

 Protocol:

24 Samples

  1. Aliquotted 8 ml of DMEM media and placed in water bath ,    10:30-11:00
  2.  Retrieve N = 1 alginate from bioreactor and N = 1 alginate from the 6 well plate and N = 1 cell seeded zein from the 24 well plate
  3. Weighed out 40 mg of MTT (Stock #884) into a falcon tube then add  8 ml of the pre-warmed DMEM.  
  4. Pipetted up and down until re-suspended. Yellow colour should form. Cover tube with foil.
  5. Returned to water bath 11:10 - 11:40
  6. Removed the vessels containing the alginate samples from the incubator 11:40
  7. Using a sterile spatula, transferred samples to new wells of a 24-well plate
  8. Covered each sample with 2 ml per well of the MTT DMEM PRF media. 
  9. Protected the plate from light using foil and placed in the incubator for 1h (37ÂºC, 5% CO2). 12:10 - 13:20
  10. Replaced media with PBS for better visibility of the sample colour.
  11. Took pictures of the samples in the MTT plate using a phone/camera and attach below.  14:10  

  12. Imaged samples down the microscope (phase), 3 images per sample. Upload images below. 14:50

Note - purple coloration indicates live cells - samples which remain yellow
suggest no cells or dead cells

General observations:

All alginate samples showed a black stain with good cell coverage.

The zein samples had a purple tinge but not visibly black on either side. The
zein cell seeded from the 24WP control and the ractor did not look any
different from the cell free by eye. No cells could be seen under the
microscope because the zein blocked out all light.

FIX and DAPI STAINING PROTOCOL

### Process:

  1. Removed flask(s)/plate(s) `culture IDs:` removed reactor and 24w plate containing scaffolds from the incubator.

  2. Used sterile tweezers to carefully transfer   `21`  scaffold pieces to separate wells on a 96 well plate.

  3. Washed the pieces on the 24 well plate 2 times in 2 ml of PBS for  `5`  minutes at room temperature.

    1. 15:33-15:38
    2. `15:39-15:44`
  4. Added   1 mL of 4% PFA to each scaffold and incubate for  `15` min at room temperature.

    * `15:30-15:45`
  5. Washed pieces once more for   `5` minutes in PBS at room temperature.

    * `15:48-15:53`
    *   

  6. Aspirate PBS and stain the pieces with 1 mL of DAPI in PBS (1:1000) (21 x 1 ml = 21 ml -> 21 ul of DAPI required)  
  
Leave for 5 minutes in the dark.

    * `15:56-16:01  
`

    *   

  7. Wash the pieces 2 times for   5   `minutes in` 2 ml of PBS.

    1. `16:05 - 16:10`
    2. `16:14 - 16:20`
  8. Aspirate the PBS and leave the scaffold pieces just covered by fresh PBS. time

`label the plate halves with the respective culture IDs and date of fixing
and/or staining`

  

Placed in the biomaterials fridge. `16:22`
