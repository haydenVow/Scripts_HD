Process:

1\. Aliquotted 2mL of E6 and HS Media in  2 x 15mL     tube(s). Placed in
water bath   09:37  am

Removed plates at  

2\. Removed  100  % of Growth Media from vessel.

3\. Replaced with  100 uL (per well/per vessel) of  Diff   media.

4\. Returned vessel to incubate at  [ 09:59  ]

  * [X]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (aviary cells)

  

  * Incubator (#68 ), Lab [Library]
