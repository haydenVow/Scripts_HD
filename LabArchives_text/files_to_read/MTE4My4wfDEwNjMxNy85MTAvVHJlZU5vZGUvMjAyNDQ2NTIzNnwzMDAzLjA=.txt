Reagent preparation:

2\. Centrifuged the secondary antibody stock using the benchtop
microcentrifuge for 10 seconds.

3\. Prepared Secondary Antibody mix:

  1.2 µL   Secondary #1 AF488 goat anti-mouse IgG1  (1:1000  ) +  1.2 µL
Secondary #2 AF555 goat anti-mouse IgG2b   (1:1000  ) +  1.2  mL Blocking
Buffer (PBST (0.1% Triton X + dPBS) + 3% BSA)  

If using AlexaFluor secondary antibodies then the max concentration should be
1:500 (typically used at 1:1000)

4\. Prepared DAPI mix:

  1.2 mL  PBS +  1.2  uL  of DAPI

Vortexed DAPI mix and stored refrigerated away from light until needed.




Process:

2\. Washed 3 times for 5 min with PBS at RT.

 14:19 - 14:24 a/pm

 14:25 - 14:30 a/pm

 14:31 - 14:36 a/pm

3\. Incubated the cells with secondary antibody mixture in the dark at RT for
1 hour.  14:38 - 15:40 a/pm

NOTE: from this step onwards protect from the light by wrapping plates in foil
and perform experiment in the dark.




Counter staining

1\.  Removed 2nd antibody solution.  15:41 a/pm

2\.  Washed with DAPI (1:1000) in PBS for 5 min at RT in the dark.

 15:41 - 15:46 a/pm

3\.  Washed in PBS 3 x 5 min at RT in the dark. (No Triton)

 15:47 - 15:52 a/pm

 15:53 - 15:58 a/pm

4\.  Replaced dPBS.

 16:00 a/pm

5\. Confirmed staining on microscope by imaging.




### Image on Zaber

  1. Plates were imaged on the Zaber on 5x magnification with the following settings:
    1. 1 image per well (in the centre) per channel
    2. DAPI: exposure 25, illuminator lamp: 35 
    3. AF488: exposure 400, illuminator lamp: 37
    4. AF555: exposure 800, illuminator lamp: 100
