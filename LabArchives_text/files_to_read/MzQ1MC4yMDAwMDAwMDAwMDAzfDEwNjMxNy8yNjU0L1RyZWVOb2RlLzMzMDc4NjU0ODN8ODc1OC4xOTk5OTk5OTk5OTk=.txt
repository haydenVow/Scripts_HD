### Calculate volume of ACF-media required

Use the google sheet below to calculate the total volume of ACF-media required
for the duration of the experiment. To do this:

  1. Enter the number of either 2CFs or 4CFs seeded that are being switched to ACF growth media. 
  2. Enter the total number of scaffolds being seeded with ACF growth media (remember to include cell-free scaffolds in ACF growth media) 
    * Note: the final total volume calculation adds an error buffer of 30 mL 




ACF media iteration:  E8_  

Volume of media being made:     mL




## Make ACF media

  1. Prepared 2M solution of GABA according to E8_9C Media Calculator instructions.  
  2. Prepared 2M hypoxanthine solution according to E8_9C Media Calculator instructions.
  3. Added   mL of F12 and   mLof DMEM to vessel 
    * Note: For making 1 - 2.5 L, used a Schott bottle, for >2.5 L used a carboy)
  4. Added all the ingredients needed for   mL of E8 media following E8 calculator spreadsheet.
  5. Added ACF ingredients according to the E8_9C Media Calculator spreadsheet.
  6. If making 10C, 11B, 11C or 11E, added following ingredient (referred to recipes for volume/concentration (E8_10 iterations  and E8_11 iterations)):
    1. 10C: Glyoxylic acid 
    2. 11B: IL-6 
    3. 11C: Extra P38i
    4. 11E: IGF-1-LR3
  7. Sterile filtered medium.
  8. Added   mL of concentrated lipid solution to media (E8_9C Media Calculator).
  9. Wrapped bottle with foil to protect from light  
  10. Labelled and stored in fridge
