## Performed by: Bonnie Tangey




Note

I initially intended to seed suspension experiments with these cells today,
however after commencing the passage on the BIRDY OptiPRO cultures, it became
apparent that there were not yet enough cells, as I was hoping for at lease 6M
for suspension experiments + an additional 5-10M cells for an MCB bank. See
entry for passage here: https://au-

50% feeds were performed on all cultures.

Process for feed

  1. Growth media pre-warmed to 37C, by placing in the water bath for >15min.
  2. Imaged 1x flask from each condition, and noted observations in the table below.
  3. Cultures removed from the incubator and placed in the BSC
  4. 50% of the growth media removed from each vessel (15mL)
  5. Media replaced with 15mL of each cultures growth medium
  6. Returned to the cell culture incubator, Library Lab #160, 37C and 5% CO2.  
  




Observations/Summary:  
See table.
