AIM/PURPOSE: To adapt Nuvonis suspension cells to grow in medium containing
100% HEK/CHO HD media or 90:10 RPMI:HEK/CHO HD media.

HYPOTHESIS: Given HEK and CHO are high density media, we hypothesise that
Nuvonis suspension cells will reach a comparable growth rate to that obtained
in 100% Freestyle 293 media and/or 90:10 RPMI:Hycell CHO.
