### Process:

3\. Aliquotted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then
placed all aliquots to bead bath at 37 degrees  

  1. Growth media (for seeding):     30    mL 




  

5\. Washed the vessel(s) with 10mL dPBS (room temp)

6\. Discarded washes then added    10     mL tryple to each vessel/well and
incubated at 30˚C, 5% CO2 for 8 minutes.  

7\. Neutralised with     10     dPBS and combined cell suspension into a
50mL    tube.

8\. Centrifuged at 400xg for 5 minutes.




  

11\. Aliquoted     20uL     of resuspended cells into a microcentrifuge tube
for cell count.

12\. Performed a cell count using the haemocytometer and recorded the cell
count data in the Google Doc spreadsheet: Cell Count Spreadsheet or cell count
widget below.

  1. Total cell number was:    5,064,000 cells          

  2. Volume of cell suspension required for subculture (1.1375x10^6 cells) was:      1.348 mL      

  3. Cell density per vessel:    6500 cells/cm^2       




13\. Transferred      1.348     mL of cell suspension to the pre-warmed
30     mL Growth media:  

14\. Transferred cell suspension into 1xT175 flasks (30mL each)  

16\. Transferred vessel(s) to incubate at:

  * [x]  30ºC, 5% CO2 (CHOMP cells)




Observations/Summary:

Seeded at a lower density than specified to avoid so much peeling prior to
passaging next time.
