Process:

1\. Aliquotted   60mL  mL of  growth Media into  2x50mL     tube(s) (30mL per
tube). Placed in water bath   15:39 a/pm

2\. Stopped the shaker and removed cultures from the incubator before
restarting the shaker   16:40 a/pm

3\. Placed suspension flask(s) inside the BSC and allowed to sit static for
3-5 minutes to allow microcarriers to settle to the base of the flask.

2\. Carefully removed  50  % of supernatant from the flask(s) by pipetting
slowly and following the meniscus with the pipette tip so as to avoid placing
the pipette tip near the microcarriers at the base of the flask(s).

3\. Replaced with   15mL (per well/per vessel) of  GM   media.

4\. Returned vessel to incubate at:   16:55 a/pm , incubator #  67  

  * [X]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (aviary cells)
