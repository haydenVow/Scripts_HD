Took samples

  1. Unscrewed the "BENCHMARK" sample tube cover.
  2. Sprayed down the tube end with 70% ethanol.
  3. Connecedt a 5 mL sterile syringe.
  4. Withdrew slightly more than 3 mL (to purge the line).
  5. Discarded the 5 mL syringe.
  6. Connected a fresh sterile syringe and withdrew 3.5 - 4.0 mL of sample.
  7. Disconnected sample syringe and transferred 1 mL of sample each to 3 x 1.5 mL Eppendorf tubes for subsequent analysis.
  8. Sprayed sample tube end and cap with 70% ethanol, re-attached cap.
  9. Prepared sample for biochemistry analysis
    1. Took 300 uL, centrifuged at 500 RCF for 5 minutes
    2. Transferred 250 uL of supernatant to 250 uL of ultrapure lab water
    3. Labelled tube "Biostat TT 01-Aug-2022"
    4. Transferred to green tube rack for EPIC32419 in freezer 71 Albert 6582
  10. Replaced old base bottle with a fresh one
    1. Added 200 mL of ultrapure water to a clean 250 mL Schott bottle
    2. Added 8 g of sodium hydroxide pellets to the water
    3. Capped the bottle and sterilized by autoclaving
    4. Once the bottle was sterilized, transferred it into the BSC
    5. Turned off the base pump, clamped the line and removed it from the base pump
    6. Transferred the old bottle (still attached to bioreactor) into the BSC
    7. Swapped over the lids from the old and new bottles
    8. Reinstalled the base line in the base pump
    9. Turned the pump to manual to prime the line
    10. Turned the pump to automatic to continue automatic dosing to control pH

Growth factors2x 50 mL, snap freeze pelletfalcon tube-80C1\. Before harvest,
take 2x 50 mL sample.  
2\. Centrifuge the samples to remove as much supernatant as you would during
production.  
3\. Snap-freeze pellet in LN2 and store in -80 deg C

Mycoplasma2x 2 mLeppendorf-80C1\. Media should not be changed for 3-4 days
prior to sampling.  
2\. Before harvest, remove 2x 2 mL of medium from the culture to be tested and
transfer to a sterile  
centrifuge tube. Centrifuge at 450 g for 5 minutes to remove cell debris.  
3\. Transfer 2x 1 mL medium from this tube to a second sterile tube. Eppendorf
tubes are  
suitable so long as the closure of the lid is considered safe for shipping.
Samples can  
be stored at 4 degrees celcius if shipped within 24-48 hours, but otherwise
should be stored at -80 degrees Celcius.
