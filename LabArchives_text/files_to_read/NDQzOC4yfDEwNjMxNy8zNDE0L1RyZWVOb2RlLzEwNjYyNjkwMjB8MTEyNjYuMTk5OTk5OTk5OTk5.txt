For both plates, the cell requirement is 540,000 cells in total.

13\. Transferred           µl of cell suspension containing        cells  to
the pre-warmed           mL Growth media:      :    a/pm

14\. Transferred cell suspension into the pre-gelatin coated
vessel.

15\. Left at RT in the BSC for 30 min to allow cells to settle      :  \-  :
a/pm  

16\. Transferred vessel(s) to incubate at:

  * [ ]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (avian cells)

Version Change Log

NameChange Details  
V1 (original)N/A  
V2Changed all sentences to past tense to better reflect a hand-written lab
book entry.  
Various formatting changes.  
Addition of more detail to step 2, removal of step 3. Replaced volume
requirements table with updated volumes @Sep 22, 2020  
Updated temperature selection for mammalian/aviary cells @Sep 23, 2020  
V3Included a section for 'vessel type' in passage ID table Replace
'flask/plate' with 'vessel' throughout lab book Include at step 1 to take
image of vessel on the microscope  
Mentioned that dPBS for washing should be warm - step 3(2) and 5.  
Added timepoint at step 4 for when vessel is removed from incubator  
Include at step 11 to aliquot cell resuspension into microcentrifuge tube  
Included at step 10 and 13 time point for when cell pellet is resuspended and
when resuspended cells is moved into growth media.  
Included p38i in table of regent used  
Combined two dPBS entries in 'Media/reagents' table Added 'cell density per
vessel'
