RELATED TO OKR:  Achieve 30g/L wet-weight cell mass in shake flask by 1
September

AIM/PURPOSE: To determine which media ingredients in CHO-in-one are limiting
reagents/factors for cell proliferation and expansion in achieving 30g/L wet-
weight cell mass.

HYPOTHESIS: Certain media ingredients will deplete in CHO-in-one, which will
limit the density to which cells can proliferate when cultured in a batch-
mode. We expect to be able to determine what these limiting factors are by
comparing the depletion of ingredients with respect to the proliferation of
cells over time. We also expect to be able to determine what concentrations
these ingredients should be altered to, by comparing the concentration of
these identified ingredients in CHO-in-one to those in positive control
conditions HyCell and Freestyle.
