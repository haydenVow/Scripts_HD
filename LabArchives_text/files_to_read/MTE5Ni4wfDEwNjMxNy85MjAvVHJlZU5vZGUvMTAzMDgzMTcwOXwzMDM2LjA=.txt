Process:

1\. Aliquotted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then
placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath for a minimum of 20 minutes
prior to use:

  1. Growth media (for seeding):    2   mL in    15 mL    tube
  2. Times that all aliquots were placed in the water bath to warm before use  15:16

Note: if aliquots were placed in water bath at different times, record the
time stamp for each individual solution.




2\. Retrieve 6-well plate from shaker plate and transfer to the BSC.

3\. Transfer cell suspension into sterile 15 mL falcon tube.

4\. Spin down the filtrate (single cells in the media) at 3000 rpm for 5
minutes to pellet the cells.

  1. Start/Finish time for centrifugation was  15:22   \-  15:27   

5\. Aspirate the spent media (supernatant) and re suspend the cell pellet in
fresh media at 100-500K cells per mL- this will depend on the cell count (the
higher the better).

6\. Volume of cell suspension required for subculture was:    2 mL  

7\. Transfer cell suspension into (non-gelatin coated)   6-well   plate.

8\. Transfer the new flask to incubate on the shaker platform at 85 RPM and
leave the cells at constant agitation until the next passage/cell count.
