Process


### Manually checked cells

  1. Removed the cells from the incubator and examine them under magnification for abnormalities
  2. Image all wells in Row B before proceeding with alamarBlue staining.

Cell labelling and absorbance reading

  1. Removed well plate(s) from the incubator and added 10 uL (96-wp) or 4 uL (384-wp) of the working alamarBlue solution directly to each test and blank well of the 96 well plate using a multichannel pipette.

  2. Incubated the wells at 37ºC (30ºC if working with reptilian cells) for 1-4 hours. Timestamp

  3. After incubation, read the absorbance at 570 nm and 600 nm using the SPECTROstar Nano Absorbance Reader

    * Note: alamarBlue specific absorbance is measured at 570 nm, the 600 nm absorbance reading is used to eliminate background signal contributed by cell debris or other non specific absorbance.

  4. Cell concentrations in wells in each column were seeded at the following densities:
