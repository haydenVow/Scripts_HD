DNA EXTRACTION

Screening PCR protocol - DNA extraction of adherent CHOMP

1.    Transferred a sample of cells from each group into separate 1.5 ml tubes (1/10 of counted cell suspension roughly) 

  1.  
  2.   

  3.   

2.    Centrifuged cells down to form a pellet (300g for 5 minutes)

3.    Aspirated off media

4.    Resuspended pellet in 100 ul PBS and transfer to 0.5 mL tube

5.    Centrifuged cells down to form a pellet (300g for 5 minutes) 

6.    Aspirated off PBS

7.    Resuspended in 50 μL HotShot solution

8.    Incubated at 95°C for 30 min in the thermocycler using the bentolab

9.    Cooled plates to room temperature, and added 50 μL neutralising buffer, mixing well by pipetting up-and-down with a P200 multichannel pipette.

10.    Stored DNA extractions at 4°C for up to two weeks, or at −20°C for up to 1 year. (fridge/Freezer ID #)
