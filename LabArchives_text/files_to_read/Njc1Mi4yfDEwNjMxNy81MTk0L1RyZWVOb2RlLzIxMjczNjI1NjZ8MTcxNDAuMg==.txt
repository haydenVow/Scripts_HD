Process:

Preparing and coating 96-well plate with ULA coatings

1\. Remove pre-prepared 1.5% agarose from bio materials fridge and place on
hot plate at 60'C to melt the agarose into the solution

2\. Once re-dissolved add 50 uL of agarose to each well according to the
96-well plate map below and allow to set for at least 30 minutes on the BSC
surface 14:25 - 14:55

3\. Sterile filter the pre-prepared pluronic F127 and poloxamer 188 solutions
through a 0.22 um filter unit in the BSC

4\. Add 50 uL of both pluronic and poloxamer into the 96-well plate according
to the plate map below and allow to coat for 1 hr in the BSC 14:35 - 15:35

5\. Prepare MC solutions by adding the required amount (g) to separate 50 mL
aliquots of growth media

  1. 1% - 0.5 g
  2. 0.6% - 0.3 g
  3. 0.45% - 0.225 g
  4. 0.3% - 0.15 g
  5. 0.1% - 0.05 g

6\. Transfer each MC solution to the water bath at 37'C and allow to warm for
10-20 minutes

7\. Transfer MC solutions in the fridge to cool and dissolve the MC powder

8\. Once dissolved sterile filter each solution through a 0.22 um filter.

9\. Add 180 uL of each MC solution to the 96-well plate according to the plate
map below

10\. Proceed with thawing the CHOMP fibroblasts.

Process:

1\. Aliquotted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then
placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath for a minimum of 20 minutes
prior to use:

  1.  Growth media (for seeding):   32 mL in  1x 50 mL  tubes 
  2.  Time that all aliquot was placed in the water bath to warm before use:  16:33 

2\. Collected the cryovial from Liquid Nitrogen storage & place in foam
floater in water bath for 5 min  16:50 - 16:55

Location where cryovial was collected from:

 Homer  OR Dewer 1

Tower/Bucket # 5

Box/Cane # 5  

Vial location: B4  

Vial ID(s): 3614-Culture-8616-Vial-4of23  




3\. Ethanol sprayed & transferred the vial(s) to the BSC.

4\. Added 1000 µL of Growth Media (to generate a total volume of 1mL in the
cryovial) to the cryovial, resuspend the cell suspension gently to reduce
osmotic shock.

5\. Transfer the entire 2 mL resuspension into a 15 mL tube and centrifuge at
650 x g

  1. Start/Finish time was: 17:00 - 17:05

6\. Decant the supernatant to remove residue freezing buffer and resuspend
pellet in 2 mL of fresh growth media

7\. Transfer 10 uL of the resuspension into 10 mL of growth media (this will
give a concentration of 3.333 cells per mL)

8\. Transfer 75 uL of the resuspension into a seperate 10 mL aliquot of growth
media

9\. Transfer 150 uL of the first resuspension into each of the well with the
agarose, poloxamer and pluronic treatments.

10\. Transfer 20 uL of the second resuspension into each well of the MC
treatments

11\. Transfered flask/plate(s) to incubate at:

  * [x]  30ºC, 5% CO2 (reptile cells)
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (aviary cells)




SOPs used:

  * SOP_Thawing Cells Into Adherent Culture V_02




Summary:

\- Higher MC solution are extremley difficult to sterile filter. Additionally
after they were filtered they appeared less viscous, so the filter may
actually be removing the MC. Might be worth testing the autoclave of a
concentrated solution that can then be diluted.
