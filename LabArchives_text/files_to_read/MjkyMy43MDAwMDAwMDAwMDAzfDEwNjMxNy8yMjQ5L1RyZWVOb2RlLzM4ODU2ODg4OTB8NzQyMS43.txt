## Performed by: LL  




Reagent preparation:

1\. Aliquotted    2 mL  PBS for washing

2\. Centrifuged the secondary antibody stock using the benchtop
microcentrifuge for 10 seconds.

3\. Prepared Secondary Antibody mix (pipette from the top/supernatant of
antibody solution):

  1 ÂµL   Goat anti mouse IgG2b AF555   (1:1000  ) +   1  mL Blocking Buffer
(PBST (0.1% Triton X + dPBS) + 3% BSA)  

If using AlexaFluor secondary antibodies then the max concentration should be
1:500 (typically used at 1:1000)

Pipette-mixed antibody mix and stored refrigerated away from light until
needed.

4\. Prepared DAPI mix:

   1mL  PBS +    1uL  of DAPI

Vortexed DAPI mix and stored refrigerated away from light until needed.

Process:

1\. Removed plate from fridge (incubated in primary antibodies overnight).

2\. Washed 3 times for 5 min with PBS at RT.

 13:13 - 13:18

 13:19 - 13:24

 13:25 - 13:30

3\. Incubated the cells with secondary antibody mixture in the dark at RT for
1 hour. Placed in black box to protect from light.  13:31 - 14:31  

NOTE: from this step onwards protect from the light by wrapping plates in foil
and perform experiment in the dark.




Counter staining

1\.  Removed 2nd antibody solution.  14:31

2\.  Washed with DAPI (1:1000) in PBS for 5 min at RT in the dark.

 14:32 - 14:37

3\.  Washed in PBS 3 x 5 min at RT in the dark. (No Triton)

 14:39 - 14:45

 14:46 - 14:51

4\.  Replaced dPBS.

 14:51  

5\. Confirmed staining on microscope by imaging using the zaber microscope
using the following settings.

  * 1x1 tile imaging (one image captured at the centre of each well, 5x objective.
  * DAPI and AF555 channels captured, unsuring images are not over/underexposed
    * DAPI exposure time: [50]  ms, DAPI lamp intensity [     ] 
    * AF555 exposure time [150] ms, AF555 lamp intensity [     ]

6\. Parafilmed plate and placed in Fridge 65 in Library Lab 15:16




SOPs used:

  * SOP_Immunofluorescence Staining V_02

### Results

  * Results were;
    * [x]  As Usual (this is a repetitive task)
    * [ ]  Unexpected because...
    * [ ]  Need to be further analysed
    * [ ]  Other (.......)




Relevant Images/Figures (if applicable):

Note: Images were not coming through from Zaber so also took some images using
Axio (10X, 2 reps per well, DAPI + AF555)
