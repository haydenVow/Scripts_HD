Prepare materials for thaw and seed:

Aliquoted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then
placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath

  * 4 mL Growth medium (DMEM/F12 + 20%FBS) for cell count  

  * 72 mL Growth medium (DMEM/F12 + 20%FBS) for seeding 
    * Time that aliquots were placed in the water bath to warm before use:   10:50 am 




## Thaw and seed vial:

1\. Collected the cryovial from Liquid Nitrogen storage & place in foam
floater in water bath for 5 min  11:15 - 11:20 am

Location where cryovial was collected from:

Vial details: 1 x F_CHOMP09 cryovials at 2M cells each for a total of 4M cells

Brew

Tower/Bucket #5

Box/Cane #5

Vial location: D1, C9

Vial ID(s):

  1. 3629-Culture-8616-Vial-19of23 (aka 12367-FrzCul-F_CHOMP09-Vial-19of23)
  2. 3628-Culture-8616-Vial-18of23 (aka 12366-FrzCul-F_CHOMP09-Vial-18of23)   

2\. Ethanol sprayed & transferred the vial(s) to the BSC.

3\. Added 500 µL of Growth Media to the cryovial, resuspended the cell
suspension gently to reduce osmotic shock.

4\. Collected the entire cell suspension & transferred into the pre-warmed 4
mL of Growth Medium.

5\. Using a 5 mL serelogical, measured exactly how much volume is in the cell
suspension aliquot (for accurate cell count)

6\. Took 1 x 10 uL aliquot from cell suspension and performed cell count.
Count = 2.85M cells

7\. Added 5.7 mL of cell suspension containing 2,850,000 cells (allows for
7500 cells per cm2) to 67 mL (should have been 55 mL) Growth Medium aliquot

  * Note: if there are less than 3,375,000 live cells in the vial, seed into as many flasks as ensures 7500 cells per cm2

8\. Evenly distributed cells in Growth Medium

9\. Seeded 5 x T75s with 12 mL (actually ~14.4 mL) cell suspension per vessel

10\. Transfered flask/plate(s) to incubate: 12:35 pm (Incubator #116)

  * [ ]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (avian cells)
  * [x]  30ºC, 5% CO2 (reptilian cells)

Summary:

2 x F_CHOMP09 vials thawed and seeded into 5 x T75s (it should be noted that
an insoluble spec of some sort was found in vial 3628 - advised by CO not to
be a concern). Flasks were seeded with 14.4 mL instead of 12 mL due to an
error made while calculating the volume of seed media required.
