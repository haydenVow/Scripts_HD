RELATED TO OKR:  Release of first product. Program team 1; AND 1-tonne scale
Program team 2

AIM/PURPOSE: Pilot run of RM 50L Sartorius bioreactor using Nuvonis quail
cells to generate mass for product team

HYPOTHESIS: N/A This is a pilot experiment to test workflow

RESULTS SUMMARY: Cell viability decreased over time as batch proceeded
following initial seeding. Cell viability reached 0% and batch was terminated.
Likely cause: large delay in seeding cells into the RM bag from a glass Schott
bottle (no CO2 supply and no agitation) for ~1hour. Delay caused by
manufacturing error in bag where one side of bag was entirely unsealed.

CONCLUSIONS: Batch terminated due to cell death.

NEXT STEPS: Repeat batch with same culture parameters. Implement operator QC
checks to ensure quality of bag before use. Contact manufacturer (Sartorius)
about manufacturing fault in consumable.
