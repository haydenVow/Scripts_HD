### Process:

1\. Took images of each vessel with microscope on phase setting (10X and 4X).

2\. Aliquoted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then
placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath for a minimum of 20 minutes
prior to use:

  1. TrypLE:   5  mL in   1 x 15 mL  tube
  2.  dPBS (for neutralising & washing):   10  mL
  3. Growth media (for pellet resuspension):  2 mL   

  4. Growth media (for seeding):    12  mL

Time that all aliquots were placed in the water bath the warm before use
15:17 - 15:22  

Note: if aliquots were placed in water bath at different time, record the time
stamp for each individual solution.




3\. Removed vessel(s) from the incubator  15:22  

4\. Washed the vessel(s) with  5 mL per flask dPBS (warmed).

5\. Added   5  mL tryple to each vessel/well and incubated at 37˚C.

  1. Start/Finish for TrypLE was     15:46 - 15:53  

6\. Neutralised with   5 mL    dPBS and moved the cell suspension into   1 x
50 mL  tubes.  

7\. Centrifuged at 300 x g for 5 min.

  1. Start time for centrifugation was     16:02-16:07     




8\. Aspirated the supernatant.

9\. Resuspended pellet in   2  mL   growth  medium  

10\. Aliquoted   10 uL  of resuspended cells into a microcentrifuge tube for
cell count.

11\. Performed a cell count using the haemocytometer and recorded the cell
count data in the Google Doc spreadsheet: Cell Count Spreadsheet or cell count
widget below

  1. Total cell number was:    

    * CHOMP09:   1.94M cells    

  2. Volume of cell suspension required for subculture was:    

    1. CHOMP09:   1353 uL for T175; 647 uL for T75  
  3. Cell density per vessel:   ~7500 cells/cm2   
  4. Add cell counts to the doublings calculator to allow tracking over time: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1kiVXcsre8aDPtA9DjQ84WzN0dLb7jrzD9GehzExe7Ng/edit#gid=0  




12\. Transferred the cell suspension of the following volume into the pre-
warmed   30 ml & 12 mL growth medium aliquots:

  * CHOMP09 cell suspension volume:   1353 uL & 647 uL 

13\. Transferred cell suspension into   1 x T175 & 1 x T75  vessels.

14\. Transferred vessel(s) to incubate at:   17:55 , incubator #82 main lab  

  * [ ]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (avian cells)
  * [x]  30ºC, 5% CO2 (reptilian cells)   




Observations/Summary:

Lots of cell debris present in the flask prior to the passage - possibly due
to over-seeding.
