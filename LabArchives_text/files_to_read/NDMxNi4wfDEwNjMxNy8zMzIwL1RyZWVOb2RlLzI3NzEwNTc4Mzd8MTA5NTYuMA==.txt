### Process:

1\. Took image of vessel with microscope on phase setting.

3\. Aliquotted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then
placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath for a minimum of 20 minutes
prior to use:

  1. TrypLE:     10    mL in      1   tubes
  2.  dPBS (for neutralising):     10    mL
  3.  dPBS (for washing):    10     mL
  4. Growth media (for pellet resuspension):      2   mL
  5. Growth media (for seeding):    48     mL 

Time that all aliquots were placed in the water bath the warm before use
14:01 pm

Note: if aliquots were placed in water bath at different time, record the time
stamp for each individual solution.




4\. Removed vessel(s) from the incubator   14:22 pm

5\. Washed the vessel(s) with dPBS (warmed).

6\. Added   10     mL tryple to each vessel/well and incubated at 37˚C.

  1. Start/Finish for TrypLE was   14:27 pm 

7\. Neutralised with   10mL   dPBS and combined cell suspension into a     1x
50mL    tube.

8\. Centrifuged at 650 x g for 5 min.

  1. Start/Finish time for centrifugation was   14:47 - 14:52 pm 




9\. Aspirated the supernatant(s).

10\. Resuspended pellet(s) in      4   mL      Growth    media    15:00  pm

11\. Aliquoted   10uL  of resuspended cells into a microcentrifuge tube for
cell count.

12\. Performed a cell count using the haemocytometer and recorded the cell
count data in the Google Doc spreadsheet: Cell Count Spreadsheet or cell count
widget below

  1. Total cell number was:    2,528,000  
  2. Volume of cell suspension required for subculture was:      all       

  3. Cell density per vessel:   2,000 cells / cm2 in 1 x 2-layer cell factory   




Warmed up an additional 254mL of Growth Media at 37C 15:06 pm

13\. Transferred     ALL   µl of cell suspension to the pre-warmed     300
mL Growth media:    15:26 pm

14\. Transferred cell suspension into the    2-layer cell factory   vessel.

15\. Transferred vessel(s) to incubate at: 15:33 pm  

  * [ X ]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (avian cells)




Observations/Summary:

\- F_KUZCO18 cells harvested from 1 x confluent T175 flask and seeded at 2,000
cells / cm2 in 1 x 2-layer cell factory.
