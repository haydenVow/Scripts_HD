Process

Before harvest

1\. Gelatin-coated 8 x wells of a 96WP and placed in incubator. Timestamp:
11:33

2\. Aspirated DMEM from 8 wells with scaffolds. Added 150 uL of EPL to 4 x
wells (as labelled on plate map). Left for one hour, then aspirated off. Left
plate with lid slightly ajar in BSC until seeding time. Timestamp for EPL
13:22 - 14:22

After harvest

1\. Transferred 8.38323 mL of cell suspension (for scaffold seeding) and
0.08383 mL of cell suspension (for planar seeding) into 2 x 15 mL tubes.

2\. Centrifuged cells for scaffold seeding at 650g for 5 min (needed to be
able to resuspend in less growth media for denser cell suspension)

  * Timestamp: 14:51 - 14:56 pm

2\. Resuspended pellet for scaffold seeding in 480 uL of growth media (enough
for 8 scaffolds seeded with 60 uL of media - do not use multichannel pipette)

3\. Pipetted 60 uL of cell suspension onto 8 x scaffolds. Repeated for planar
culture with 140 uL of cell suspension per well for 8 x wells. Allowed to rest
in BSC for 30 minutes.

  * Timestamp: 15:05 - 15:35

4\. Added growth media to scaffolds to make volume up to 230 uL

5\. Transferred flask/plate(s) to incubate at:

  * [x]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (aviary cells)
