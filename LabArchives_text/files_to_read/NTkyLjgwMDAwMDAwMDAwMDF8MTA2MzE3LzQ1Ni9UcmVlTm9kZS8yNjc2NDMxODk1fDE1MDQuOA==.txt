Growth media (10L)

Proposed method for Growth media (10L)

Reagent

  * DMEM - 3.95 L
  * F12 - 3.95 L
  * P/S - 100 mL
  * FBS - 2 L
  * L-Glutamin 

Item and reagent list

  * Carboy 
  * Tubing 
  * 250 mL, 500 mL 1L corning bottles
  * Filter unit
  * Peristaltic pump or vacuum pump 
  * Tweezers 
  * 1 x Serological

  

Method:

  1.  Autoclave 10L carboy
  2. Transfer Carboy into BSC and remove any excess water inside the carboy 
  3. Add reagents into the carboy and mix 
  4. Attach serological to tubing  (make sure to remove cotton bud with tweezers) and place inside the carboy 
  5.  Filter into 250 mL, 500 mL and 1L plastic corning bottles: 
    1. 'MilliporeSigma™ Stericap™ PLUS Sterile Bottle-Top Filter Device': Use a vacuum to filter 
    2. Sartorius filter cap - Use a peristaltic pump 

Notes:

250 mL = 300 mL GM (For feeds)

500 mL = 600 mL GM (for seeding)

1L = spare (for lab and cell count)




PBS

Proposed method for dPBS (under 5L)

  1. Directly add to Schotte bottle and autoclave 

  

Proposed method for dPBS (10 L)

Reagents

  * 96g PBS 
  * 10L milliQ

Equipement

  * 250 mL Schotte bottle
  * 500 mL Beaker/container
  * 1L Schotte bottle 
  * Carboy
  * Silicon tubing 
  * Peristaltic pump
  * 2 x 50 mL serological 
  * Tweezers to remove cotton bud   

Method for 10 L:

  1. Weight out 96g of dPBS powder in a 500 mL beaker 
  2. Add 300 mL of MilliQ to dissolve dPBS,making sure there are no lumps  
  3. Transfer content into a 10 L carboy. 
  4. Add 300 mL of MilliQ to the beaker to 'rinse'. Transfer into carboy. Repeat with 400 mL of MilliQ. (to make up 1 L) 
  5. Add 9L of MilliQ into the carboy. (should have a total of 10L of milliQ in the carboy) 
  6. Stir carboy well, making sure that all the PBS is dissolved and mixed homogeneously. 
  7. Remove cotton bud from the 50 mL serological and attach to the ends of the silicon tubing
  8. Insert one serological into the carboy containing PBS. 
  9. Thread the tube through the pump. Set pump do direction flows away from the carboy 
  10. Turn pump on and off to aliquot 200 mL of PBS into 250 mL schotte bottles. 
  11. With remaining PBS, aliquot into 1L schotte bottles 
  12. Autoclave schotte bottles (ensure that lids are loose and autoclave tape has been placed on each) 
  13. After autoclaving, tighten the lid, create a label and place in the designated area. 

  

? Do we need to wash the schotte bottles if these are only used as vessels for
transferring dPBS.

? Do we need the carboy sterile?

  




Tryple

Proposed method for tryple (10 L)

  * Reagents (10L)
  * Tryple - 1 L 
  * dPBS - 85.44 g 
  * MilliQ - 8.90 L
  * EDTA (100 mM) - 100 mL (3.722g EDTA + 100 mL dPBS)

  

Equipment

  * 1 x Autoclaved Schotte bottle - 1L, 2L 
  * 1 x Carboy 
  * 500 mL container/beaker
  * 1x Vacuum or pump 
  * 1 x Filter cap or lid
  * 1 x Tubing 
  * 1 x Serological 
  * 1 xTweezers

Method

  1. Autoclave schott bottles, 1L and 2L bottles. (provide guide? - caps on loosely, do not move glass bottles when they are still warm (will cause thermal shock), only tighten cap when the bottle has cooled down (to prevent shattering)) 
  2. Weight out 85.44g of dPBS powder in a 500 mL beaker
  3. Add 300 mL of MilliQ to dissolve dPBS,making sure there are no lumps  
  4. Transfer content into a 10 L carboy. 
  5. Add 300 mL of MilliQ to the beaker to 'rinse'. Transfer into carboy. Repeat once more. 
  6. Add 8L of MilliQ into the carboy. (should have a total of 8.9L of milliQ in the carboy)
  7. Stir carboy well, making sure that all the PBS is dissolved and mixed homogeneously. 
  8. Add tryple and EDTA into carboy and mix well. 
  9. Transfer carboy into the BSC 
  10. Filter tryple: 
  11. 'MilliporeSigma™ Stericap™ PLUS Sterile Bottle-Top Filter Device': Use a vacuum to filter 
  12. Sartorius filter cap - Use a peristaltic pump
  13. Filter into sterile bottles directly 

? Do we need sterile carboy (we are mixing non-sterile components)
