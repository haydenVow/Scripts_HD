  1. Using a sterile tweezer, remove sample from the well into a fresh plate containing pre-warmed media.  
  2. Aspirated media from      wells of each treatment and pipetted into      x 15 mL tubes 
  3. Added 100ul of PBS to each well in the now empty cell-laden 96-well plate (wash step)
  4. Removed PBS from all wells and pipetted into same tube containing media (so any washed away cells from this step will still be included in the count)  

  5. Added 50ul of Tryple to each well.
  6. Placed plate in the incubator for 10 min until cells lifted. Time stamp:    :      
  7. Removed tryple from wells and added to tubes containing media and PBS. 
    1. NOTE: If there are still a number of cells adhered to the base of the wells, add another 50 uL of tryple and replaced in incubator. Time stamp:     :     
    2. Removed tryple and added to tubes containing media, tryple and PBS.
  8. Took 1 x 10 uL sample from each 8 x cell suspensions and added       trypan blue 
  9. Loaded onto Haemocytometer and performed cell counts. (Subtract the cell count from initial seed density of this condition and divide by number of wells.)




Cell count:

  1. Cell count (     M,    sample    ): 
    * Efficiency: ((initial seeding density - cells left in plate)/ initial seeding density)*100 =          %
  2. Cell count (     M,    sample    ): 
    * Efficiency: ((initial seeding density - cells left in plate)/ initial seeding density)*100 =          %
  3. Cell count (     M,    sample    ): 
    * Efficiency: ((initial seeding density - cells left in plate)/ initial seeding density)*100 =          %
  4. Cell count (     M,    sample    ): 
    * Efficiency: ((initial seeding density - cells left in plate)/ initial seeding density)*100 =          %
  5. Cell count (     M,    sample    ): 
    * Efficiency: ((initial seeding density - cells left in plate)/ initial seeding density)*100 =          %
  6. Cell count (     M,    sample    ): 
    * Efficiency: ((initial seeding density - cells left in plate)/ initial seeding density)*100 =          %
  7. Cell count (     M,    sample    ): 
    * Efficiency: ((initial seeding density - cells left in plate)/ initial seeding density)*100 =          %
  8. Cell count (     M,    sample    ): 
    * Efficiency: ((initial seeding density - cells left in plate)/ initial seeding density)*100 =          %
