Process:

1\. Retrieve cultures from incubator and transfer into the BSC

2\. Take a 100 uL samples from each of the 30 mL cultures

3\. Return the vessels to the shaker plate in the incubator

4\. Perform a haemocytometer count and record cell number below

  

Cultures:

9309 - 5,640,000

9310 - 4,680,000

  




Observations/Summary:

\- Viability was really good >90%. Cell counts were slightly lower than
expected however the cells are likely in the lag phase after just being thawed
out.
