Reagent preparation:

Use the following spreadsheet to:

  * Determine the total amount of regent required for primary staining
  * Provide more information on antibody types

gid-1896419-b879a5de34104da8b0c7ed8843f1a7ae)

1\. Prepared    20 mL  PBST (0.2% Triton-X) (amount includes use for blocking
buffer)

2\. Prepared   10 mL  blocking buffer: PBST (0.2% Triton-X + PBS) + 3% bovine
serum albumin (BSA). (Kept in the fridge until needed in blocking step)
(amount includes use for anitbody staining)

3\. Prepared Primary Antibody Mix:  8 µL   Primary #1 MyoG (Santa Cruz)
(1:200  ) +  32 µL   Primary #2 MF20 (DSHB)   (1:50  ) +  1.6  mL Blocking
Buffer (enough to stain 16 samples with 100 uL each)

Pipette-mixed antibody mix and stored refrigerated away from light until
needed.




Process:

Fixing ( ~ 20 - 30 min)

  1. Removed media from each well and wash with PBS. 
  2. Transfer thin gel slices or entire samples to PBS prefilled wells in a new 24w plate.
  3.  Added  1000 µL PFA for 15 min:  10:50 - 11:05 pm 
  4. Removed PFA (and add in PFA waste container) and wash wells 3x with   1000 µL PBS. Remove wash 1 and 2 to PFA waste!

  

Permeabilise ( ~ 20 - 30 min)

1\. Removed PBS from each well.

2\. Added  1000 µL PBST (0.2% Triton-X) to each well for 15 min:  11:25 -
11:45 pm

3\. Aspirated PBST for each well.




Blocking ( ~ 1 hr)

1\. Added  1000 µL of blocking buffer (3% BSA in PBST [0.1% Triton-X]) and
incubate for 45 minutes - 1hr at RT. (no more than 1 hour):   11:50 am - 12:50
pm




Single/Simultaneous Primary Antibody staining ( ~ 10 minutes or 2hr)

1\. Removed blocking buffer from each well.

2\. Cut samples into size for a 96 wp.

2\. Incubated cells with 100 uL primary antibody for 90min - 2hrs at RT, or
4ºC overnight:   13:02 - 15:02 pm

3\. Parafilmed plates and stored at 4ºC in tissue culture lab Fridge.

After this step, all further task should be performed in a dark room. The
vessel should also be wrapped foil when not used.
