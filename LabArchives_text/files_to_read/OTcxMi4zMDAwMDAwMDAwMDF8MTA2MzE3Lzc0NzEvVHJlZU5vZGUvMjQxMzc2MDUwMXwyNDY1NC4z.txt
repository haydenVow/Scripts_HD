Aim/Purpose


To perform a 12-factor DSD to determine the impact of 12 media ingredients on
the growth of Nuvonis suspension cells


Hypothesis


We hypothesise that >1 ingredient at the levels tested will have a
significantly positive impact on Nuvonis suspension cell growth


Technical Gap


DSD3 showed us that a 75/25 RPMI/HyCellCHO + Nuvonis ingredients supported
cell growth almost as well as 50/50 RPMI/HyCellCHO + Nuvonis ingredients (see
here - insert link to results). It also suggested that Cell Boost Supplement 2
and Difco Yeast UF were beneficial to cell growth. We still need to reduce our
HyCellCHO dependence in order to scale up our cell culture work, and therefore
want to test whether we can grow the cells in 90/10 RPMI/HyCellCHO + Nuvonis
ingredients. We will increase the concentration of yeast to 3mg/mL based on
DSD3 results, and include Cell Boost Supplement 2 as a factor again. We will
also test old ingredients that showed slight positive impacts in previous DSDs
(as the reduction of HyCellCHO medium might magnify these positive impacts)
and new ingredients that we have discovered are present in HyCellCHO and
either missing from or at a lower concentration in RPMI.


Method/Procedure


## Factors to trial and why

Base medium:

90/10 RPMI/HyCell + 3 mg/mL yeast + 0.02 mg/mL L-Ornithine monohydrochloride &
Putrescine dihydrochloride + 0.00005 mg/mL IGF-1-LR3 + 0.00001 mg/mL EGF +
1:100 ACA + 1 g/L poloxamer-188

Controls:

C1: Base medium (see above)

C2: 90/10 RPMI/HyCell + Nuvonis ingredients

C3: 75/25 RPMI/HyCell + Nuvonis ingredients

C4: 50/50 RPMI/HyCell + Nuvonis ingredients

C5: Freestyle 293 + Nuvonis ingredients

Factors:

FactorConcentration range being testedRationale  
Glutamax (200mM)1 - 2mM Think we may have been trying too-high concentrations
in past DSDs  
Glucose (100g/L)4 - 8 g/LHyCell has 9g/L, CHO-T1-SF has 6g/L, RPMI only has
2g/L  
Insulin-Transferrin-selenium (100X)0.5-1%Trying again with Nuvonis ingredients
included in base  
Sodium pyruvate (100mM)0.15 - 0.3 g/LIncluded in CHO-T1-SF and HyCell, not in
RPMI. Using CHO-T1-SF conc.  
MEM non-essential amino acids (100X)0.5 - 1%Think we may have been trying too-
high concentrations in past DSDs  
MEM essential amino acids (50X)1 - 2%Think we may have been trying too-high
concentrations in past DSDs  
FGF (0.05g/L)0.00005-0.0001 mg/mLSaw positive signals in Marie's ratio
experiment  
Cell Boost 1 (35g/L)0.625 - 1.25 g/LNon-significant positive signal in last
DSD - maybe will get stronger signal with less HyCell  
Cell Boost 2 (35g/L)0.625 - 1.25 g/LPositive signal in last DSD  
Putrescine dihydrochloride  
1-2 g/LHyCell has 1g/L. CHO-T1-SF has 2g/L. RPMI doesn't have any.  
Myo-Inositol (50g/L)0.087-0.175 g/LHigher in HyCell than RPMI  
Niacinamide (100g/L)0.004-0.008 g/LHigher in HyCell than RPMI
