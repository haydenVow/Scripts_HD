Nuvonis recommends seeding their suspension line at between 50,000 and 200,000
cells/mL, depending on what passaging schedule you are following (see tech
transfer attached below). During early Nuvonis media optimisation work, we
seeded our cultures at 50,000 cells/mL in order to reduce the initial cell
requirements. Over time, we have noticed that higher seeding densities seem to
outperform lower seeding densities in terms of growth rate (Figure 1.). We
have also anecdotally noticed two occasions where cells were seeded lower than
50,000 cells/mL and did not survive, however the same has not been observed
when cells are seeded above 200,000 cells/mL (see here \- cells were seeded at
300K cells/mL and grew from 9M to 41M over 3 days, which means they doubled
more than once every 24H). This leads us to believe that higher seeding
densities are preferable for improving growth rates in suspension Nuvonis
cultures, however this hypothesis has not yet been properly tested.
Determining this is crucial for optimising our seed train and bioreactor work,
as we have experienced a number of runs where there is a large amount of
unexplained cell death and/or poor growth, which could be due to seeding too
low.
