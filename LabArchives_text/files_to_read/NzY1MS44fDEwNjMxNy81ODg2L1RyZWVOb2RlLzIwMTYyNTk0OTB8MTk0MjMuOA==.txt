Process

  1. Collected E125s from shaker, wiped with ethanol-sprayed Rediwipe, and brought into BSC 14:25
  2. Using a 25 mL serelogical pipette, gently pipette-mixed culture to break up cell clumps
  3. Transfer suspension into 50 mL tubes. Kept E125 vessels in BSC, as culture will be returned to these vessels after feed. 
  4. Centrifuged 50 mL tubes at 300 x gfor 5 min             
    * Spin 1: 14:35 - 14:40                   
    * Spin 2: 14:43 - 14:48
  5. Aspirated 75% (15 mL) of supernatant, taking extra care to not disrupt or aspirate pellet 14:50 - 15:05
  6. Added 15 mL of fresh, warmed growth media to each 50 mL tube
  7. Took 100 uL samples from each culture and transferred to separate wells in a 96-WP, recording the location of each sample for future plate mapping 
  8. Gently pipette-mixed cultures using serological, before moving cell suspension back to E125s
  9. Returned E125s to incubator 14:00

Staining

Prepare reagents

Prepared dead stain solution in amber/black centrifuge tube:  
\- 2 mL dPBS  
\- 2 drops Nucgreen AF488 dead stain  
Vortex for 5 seconds to mix

Prepared Hoechst stain (50 ug/mL) solution in amber/black centrifuge tube:  
\- 9500 uL MilliQ  
\- 500 uL Hoechst Trihydrochloride trihydrate (1mg/mL)  
Vortex for 5 seconds to mix. Solution can be stored at 4°C for up to 6 months

Stain plates

  1. Added 100 uL dPBS into plate columns 3, 4, 9 and 10 using a multichannel pipette
  2. Added 100 uL of dead stain solution (dPBS+Sytox) to cells
  3. Serially diluted cell suspension by transferring 100 uL cell suspension to subsequent wells, down to 25% dilution
  4. Stained samples with 20 uL of Hoechst stain solution
  5. Incubated for 30 minutes in the dark at room temperature 15:35 - 16:05   

  6. Centrifuged plates at 300 RCF for 1 minute 

Prepared plate maps

  

Plate ID: 9601

Note: plate was imaged under incorrect plate ID and incorrect EPIC. Imaged
instead under plate ID 9603. There are x98 total images for this timestamp and
description ("EPIC28843 Day 3 V2"). There are 6 total A1 well images. Ignore
the earliest x4 A1 well images. There was an issue with the Zaber. Had to be
aborted, and restarted twice.

Mia image link: https://mia-
capture.vow.tools/#/session/recLrosmbbePMAKrp/images  

Plate ID: should be 9601, imaged instead under 9603.




## Imaging

  1. Configure the Zaber session to image the entirety of each well; for 96 well plates this requires a 3 x 3 stitched image
  2. Take images of each well on the blue fluroescence ("DAPI") and green fluorescence ("AF488") channels




## Analysis

  1. Analyzed the blue- and green-channel images using the DAPI and AF488 MIA macros respectively.
  2. Downloaded and extracted the data then pasted it into the "MIA output" data workbook created in the "Staining" section.
  3. Copied the data from the "Final output" sheet of the "MIA output" data workbook to the "Master Cell Counting Sheet" of the "Suspension culture counting spreadsheet": https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1YuTvXJXQQMIMwRZGeqNjdi20WeURg5FpM-1TJ-zrb1c/edit?usp=sharing
