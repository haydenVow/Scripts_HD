Process:

1\. Retrieved   2x 24 mL  of  Growth Media aliquots in   1x 50mL  tube(s) from
main lab media fridge 74  11:15 am  

 Aliquot labelled with 'SAT GM Test 2' on lid and 'EPIC21489 EStim Test 2. 50%
GM Feed JB' on the side.  
  
 ~~2\. Added  2x 6 uL p38i for 1/2000 dilution ~~ (already added)  
  
3\. Aliquots placed in water bath  11:16 am - 13:27 pm

2\. Removed  50 % of supernatant from vessel.

Note* realised half way through Plate 1 that I had been doing 100% feeds
(2mL/well), and there wouldnt be enough media for all wells. Accidentally did
100% instead of 50% feed.

Whilst waiting for a response from Chain gang on Slack, plates placed back in
incubator and remaining media placed back in waterbath 13:42 pm. (100% feeds
done on rows A and B of Plate 1)

28mL of Aliquot #5547 (from cell expansion - DMEM/F12 + 20% FBS + 1X P/S +
10uM p38i) was added to the remaining media in the 50mL tube and placed in
water bath to warm 13:48 - 14:09 pm

3\. Replaced  media on all wells with  2mL (per well/per vessel) of Dif media.

4\. Returned vessel to incubate at:   14:17 pm  

  * [x]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (aviary cells)

  

  * [x]  Thermo Incubator (ID #13)
  * [ ]  Top Sanyo Incubator (ID #25)
  * [ ]  Bottom Sanyo Incubator

  * [ ]  Bottom Binder Incubator




### Observations/Summary:

 100 % media changed on vessel(s)  (this was a mistake - it was meant to be
50% feed but RS (Bec Screnci) made a mistake of doing a 100% feed on the first
2 rows of wells)  

  1. All vessels.
