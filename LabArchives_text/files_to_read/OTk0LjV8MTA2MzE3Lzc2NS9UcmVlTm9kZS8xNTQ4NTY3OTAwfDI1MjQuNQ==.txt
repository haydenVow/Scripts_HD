RELATED TO MILESTONE:  This EPIC is not necessary related to a single
milestone but rather assessing whether we are able to successfully stain
DOLLY12 Fibroblasts in adherent culture and scaffolds in parallel given the
shift in milestones and importance of fibroblasts in the remaining quarter for
the Co-culture project team.

AIM/PURPOSE: To determine if any of the following antibodies are able to
successfully stain for DOLLY12 Fibroblasts that are fixed whilst grown in
adherent culture or seeded onto Zein scaffolds:

  1. TE-7 (Mouse anti-fibroblast antibody - already in house)
  2. TE-7 ( Mouse anti-fibroblast antibody - newly ordered)
  3. Vimentin-FITC conjugated 
  4. Vimentin-FITC conjugated with an independent secondary antibody (AF488)   

HYPOTHESIS: I hypothesise that the DOLLY12 fibroblasts seeded in adherent
culture will be able to be stained by at least one of the antibodies mentioned
above and adequately fluoresce to indicate the presence of fibroblasts when
simultaneously compared with a DAPI stain.

I hypothesise that fibroblasts seeded onto Zein scaffolds will only be
successfully stained and fluoresce using the Vimentin antibody already
conjugated with a secondary.

RESULTS SUMMARY: See report

CONCLUSIONS: Unable to stain DOLLY12 sheep fibroblast cells using the TE-7
antibodies in adherent culture, however we can detect immunofluorescent
expression of Vimentin in fibroblasts, however this does not preclude that
these cells are definitely fibroblasts.  

NEXT STEPS:

1. Research into different fibroblast antibody markers for suitability in identify our DOLLY12 cells.

2. Continue optimisation of Vimentin staining protocol.
