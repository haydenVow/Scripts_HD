Process

  1. Collected E125s from shaker, wiped with ethanol-sprayed Rediwipe, and brought into BSC
  2. Using a 25 mL serelogical pipette, gently pipette-mixed culture to break up cell clumps
  3. Transfer suspension into 50 mL tubes. Kept E125 vessels in BSC, as culture will be returned to these vessels after feed. 
  4. Centrifuged 50 mL tubes at 300 x g for 5 min

Spin 1: 11:24-11:29

  1. Maximally aspirated supernatant, taking extra care to not disrupt or aspirate pellet 
  2. Added 0.5 mL of dPBS to each tube and resuspended pellet. Transferred to sterile 1.5mL tube
  3. Rinsed 50mL falcon tube with another 0.5mL dPBS and deposited into corresponding 1.5mL tube
  4. spun tubes in bench top centrifuge at 4500xg for 10 minutes
  5. Maximally aspirated dPBS without disturbing the pellet
  6. snap froze pellets on liquid nitrogen
  7. stored in specimen jar labelled with EPIC ID in -80degC freezer 




Observations/Summary

  * cell pellets will be used for RNA extraction and then cDNA synthesis to quantify gene expression, with a view to determine changes in cells between adherent and suspension conditions. (Sarah Topfer to undertake RNA extraction)
