\- adapting cells to suspension culture puts a lot of strain on the cells

\- it is also difficult to deduce which factor is causing the cells to die
(e.g. is it media or shear stress or inability to grow without attaching to a
surface?)

\- one option is to adapt the cells to the medium in adherent culture, and
then passage them into suspension

\- see Adrian's background section for literature supporting this slow,
stepwise approach
