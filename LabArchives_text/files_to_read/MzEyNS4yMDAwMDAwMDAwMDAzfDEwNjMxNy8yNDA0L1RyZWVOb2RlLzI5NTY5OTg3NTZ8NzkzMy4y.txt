Process:

  1. Make    27 mL of each biopsy freeze media and then syringe filter:
    1. PRF DMEM/F12 + 10% HS + 10% DMSO + 1% v/v P/S -- 10mL
    2. PRF DMEM/F12 + 10% DMSO + 1% v/v P/S -- 17mL
  2. Using sterile tweezers and scissors, cut each biopsy chunk into 6 pieces in the BSC. Discarded 3-4 pieces due to lack of cryovials
  3. Place pieces into cryovials (1 piece per vial).
  4. To 1 vial per biopsy, add 1 mL of HS containing freeze media 
  5. To 1-2 vials per, add 1 mL of ACF freeze media 
  6. Transfer vials to a Mr. Frosty and move to -80 degrees C freezer.
