Process:

  1. Aliquotted  200 mL  mL of  GM listed in table above. 
  2. Placed in water bath for 10-20 minutes minimum
  3. Take 1-2x images of the entire plate.  
    1. Notes for image taking and observations: 
      1. Take a clear image of the plate using the lab-iPad positioned vertically above the plate to ensure you have a clear view of the tissue structures in each well. This will ensure we can efficiently compare the changes in the tissue formation between each feed. Placing a black surface below the plate may help provide better image contrast. 
      2. Please copy the image of the plate under the 'Relevant Images' section below.
  4. Removed   100% of supernatant from vessel and placed waste media in a -80C freezer for future analysis
    1. Be wary of spills! these plates are very full (~180-200mL per plate). Clean up an growth media spills as soon as it is safe and reasonable to do so. 
  5. Replaced with  185 mL (per well/per vessel) of  growth media (listed above) 
  6. Returned vessel to incubate. 

  * [X ]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (aviary cells)

  

  * Incubator (# 52 Ralph St ), Lab [Main/Library/Production]




### Observations/Summary:

 100 % media changed on vessel(s) ~144 hours (6 days) after seeding culture
12751.

  1. 2x Images taken of the entire plate for qualtitative analysis of tissue formation.
