CDMA/ CellTracker staining

  1. Aliquotted 10mL of each media, and placed in the water bath 10:30
  2. Diluted Cell tracker stock to 10mM in DMSO (0.00005g in 10.756ul). 10:35
  3. Diluted the stock solution of Celltracker to a final working concentration 5mM in DMEM/F12 10:45
  4. Warm working Solution to 37°C. 10:45-11:00
  5. Centrifuged suspension cultures for 5 minutes at 650g at room temperature. 10:50-10:55
  6. Resuspend the pellets well in 1ml of DMEM/F12 11:00
  7. Took 2x samples to perform count (10ul each). 1 sample will be used for trypan blue staining and the other for live/dead.  
  8. Centrifuge cells for 5 minutes at 650g 11:05
  9. Resuspend the remaining cells into their respective medias and return to the culture conditions. 11:10
  10. Resuspend the cells for cell count in 200ul of pre-warmed Celltracker Solution. 11:10
  11. Incubated 30 minutes under culture conditions. 11:10-11:40
  12. While incubating, created 2 μg/mL Propidium Iodide (PI) working solution in DMEM/F12 (2ug in 1ml) - NOTE: I later realised that the PI stock solution had already been diluted, so the working solution I created was only 0.4ug/mL 
  13. After 30 minutes, added 200ul  PI solution (giving final concentration of 1ug/ml) and mixed well. NOTE: Due to the error mentioned previously, this ended up being .2ug/mL total 
  14. Incubate in PI for 5 min 11:40-11:45
  15.  ~~Centrifuged the cells for 5 minutes at 650g to remove the staining mix.  ~~This step could not be performed because we are unable to spin eppendorf tubes in our centrifuge (we don't have inserts for it) ~~~~
  16. Dispense cells onto haemocytometer slide for counting.  
  17. Observed under fluorescence microscopy. (see observations)

Trypan Blue staining  

1\. Performed live/dead count using the additional10ul sample taken during the
CDMA/PI staining, with trypan. This stain was performed while the CDMA was
incubating. 11:20

Observations/ complications:

- Very few cells remain in culture. Cells in live/dead stain were very dilute, which made performing a cell count on stained cells impossible.  
\- PI stain was very dilute due to not knowing that the stock solution had
already been diluted previously.  
\- No CDMA or PI staining was observed (also no cells seen on the
haemocytometer)  
\- Trypan blue staining showed very few healthy/ viable cells.

Cell counts obtained using trypan blue and manual counts. NOTE: It was highly
subjective as to which cells were alive versus dead, or even cells versus
debris. Cells do not look healthy (see below for images).
