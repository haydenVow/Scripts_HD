Process:

1\. Placed  25 mL  mL of new Medium into the water bath  xxx  

2\. Placed shake flask in centrifuge and centrifuge at 300 x g for 5 min at
RT.   xxxx  

3\. Aspirated supernatant. Re-suspended pellets in xxxx media  and used a
P1000 pipette to break up cell clumps. .

6\. 20 uL  taken and cell count performed (see cell count spreadsheet here:
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1DPzKubYxfHmWogVPihC-
SSIBtIylyrBQE5kRX5Z8NtI/edit#gid=1526857572)

8\. Pellets combined in remaining 21 mL of warmed medium (to make up to 25 mL
total) and triturated with 10 mL serological pipette to break up cell clumps
and resuspend evenly

9\. Returned 4 x vessel to incubate at:  xxxxShaking at 130 RPM

  * [X]  37ÂºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
