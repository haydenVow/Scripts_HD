AIM/PURPOSE: To determine whether there is a significant difference in growth
rate, viability, and maximum cell density of Nuvnois cells when grown in
different culture vessels  
Why? Including an aim gives your experimental design a purpose and prompts you
to ask yourself before starting the experiment whether your design does in
fact address the proposed aim.  

HYPOTHESIS: We hypothesise that there will be no significant difference in
these parameters between culture vessel types  
Why? Writing out the hypothesis will encourage you to ensure your experimental
design will allow you to support/disprove the hypothesis, and to ask yourself
questions such as: Is there sufficient replicates to ensure statistical
significance?
