RELATED TO MILESTONE:  KR2 Maturation: Have live cells growing in a v2
bioreactor that supports perfusion and demonstrates improved fusion and/or
maturation beyond the v1 bioreactor

AIM/PURPOSE: To determine the optimal concentration of creatine that promotes
fusion and maturation of C2C12.

HYPOTHESIS: Addition of creatine to differentiation media (E6), will promote
the fusion and maturation of C2C12.

RESULTS SUMMARY:  "See Report".

CONCLUSIONS: The results at this stage are inconclusive as the C2C12 died
before we could test with different creatine concentrations.

NEXT STEPS: Repeat experiment, however need to adjust the seeding density and
time switched over to E6 media.
