# Procedure - Harvest

###

1\. Transfer flasks required for harvest into the BSC.

2\. Transfer cultures into 200 mL centrifuge tubes (weigh one of the 200 mL
tubes and mark weight on the vessel)

3\. Centrifuge at 650 RCF for 5 minutes

4\. Aspirate supernatants, leaving 5 mL on top of each pellet to resuspend

5\. Transfer each resuspended pellet into a single 200 mL (labelled one)

6\. Retrieve a 100 uL sample and perform a cell count

7\. Centrifuge at 650 RCF for 5 minutes

8\. Aspirate supernatant

9\. Wash the pellet twice by resuspending in dPBS followed by centrifugation
and discard supernatant

10\. Weigh the 200 mL tube containing the cell pellet

11\. Seal the 200 mL tube lid with parafilm and store at -20'C until required.
