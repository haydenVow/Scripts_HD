Process:

  1. Please observe 8x T25s under the microscope to check for any interesting/ abnormal findings. 
  2. Place all of the aliquoted media to warm in the water bath for a minimum of 10-20 minutes prior to use:
    * Growthmedia:
      1. 5 mL x D/F+10%FBS+1XP/S  

      2. 5 mL x E8_9C+rHA (OG_Richcore)
      3. 5 mL x E8_9C+rHA (new_Richcore)  

      4. 5 mL x E8_9C+rHA (Sigma)
    * Time that all aliquots were placed in the incubator to warm before use  08:45     

  3. Collected 8X T25s from the incubator, wiped with ethanol-sprayed Rediwipe, and brought into a BSC.
  4. Removed   50 % of supernatant (2.5mL) from each vessel. 
  5. Replaced with  2.5 mL (per T25 vessel) of each respective media. 
  6. Returned vessel to incubate at:   09:33    

  * [X]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (aviary cells)

### Observations/Summary:

lots of debris and dead cells in most flasks except 10% FBS, where cells look
healthy and are differentiating. Sigma seems slightly better than the other 2
bad batches
