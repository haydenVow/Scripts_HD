Process:

  1. Placed the  170 mL aliquot of  Growth Media in the bead bath set at 37 C for 20 minutes or until warm to the touch (I performed the continuous culture and the SCC feed with the same aliquot of media).
  2. Removed  15 mL (50%) supernatant from each vessel (you can use the same tip for the 3 x T175 as they contain the same batch of cells).
  3. Replaced with 15 mL of growth media per well/per vessel.
  4. Returned vessel to incubate at: 15:20
