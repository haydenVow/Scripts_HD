### Process:

  

1\. Aliquotted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then
placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath for a minimum of 20 minutes
prior to use:

  1. TrypLE:    20     mL in     Small Urine Containers    tubes
  2.  dPBS (for washing and neutralising):     2 x 20mL    mL in   2 Small Urine Containers     tubes
  3. Growth media (for pellet resuspension):     5    mL in    1 x 15mL Tube     tubes

Time that all aliquots were placed in the water bath the warm before use
15:34   a/pm

Note: if aliquots were placed in water bath at different time, record the time
stamp for each individual solution.




4\. Removed T175 vessel(s) from the incubator     16:08   a/pm

5\. Washed the vessel(s) with dPBS (warmed).

6\. Added     10    mL tryple to each vessel/well and incubated at 37ËšC.

  1. Start/Finish for TrypLE was     16:15-16:30   a/pm (25 minutes, cells were very sticky and required repeated 5 minute extra incubations after the initial 10min).   

7\. Neutralised with     10     dPBS and combined cell suspension into a
1x50mL     tube.

8\. Centrifuged at 650 x g for 5 min.

  1. Start/Finish time for centrifugation was     16:43   a/pm 




9\. Aspirated the supernatant(s).

10\. Resuspended pellet(s) in     1    mL    growth      media     17:00
a/pm

11\. Aliquoted     10uL     of resuspended cells into a microcentrifuge tube
for cell count.

12\. Performed a cell count using the haemocytometer and recorded the cell
count data in the Google Doc spreadsheet called 'Cell Count Spreadsheet' (see
link below):

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1DPzKubYxfHmWogVPihC-
SSIBtIylyrBQE5kRX5Z8NtI/edit#gid=0

  1.  Total cell number was:     552000        




13\. cell pellet was discarded.

Observations/Summary:

  * Cells had not achieved even one doubling since seeding. ~350k cells were seeded 4 days prior and only 552K cells were harvested. 
  * Cells were adhered very strongly to the plastic during harvest, tryple time was drawn out to 25 minute and the flasks were tapped rigerously to detach strongly adhered cells. 
  * Cell morphology was similar to what has been seen on previous days, very spread out and splattered;.

### Results:

  * Results were;
    * [x]  As Usual (this is a repetitive task)
    * [ ]  Unexpected because...
    * [x]  Need to be further analysed
    * We need to calculate the decrease in doubling rate. 
    * [ ]  Other (.......)
