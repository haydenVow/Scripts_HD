Cell suspension was taken out of the STR200 in a sterile manner into a
palletank bag (this was done because the remaining cells were being used to
seed the STR2000). The cells were then centrifuged from the palletank bag.

After the cell suspension had completely drained from the palletank bag the
centrifuge was kept running for a few minutes. After opening the lid we still
saw a fair amount of liquid in the centre bowl with the cell pellet. The
pellet looked similar to the last harvest but was obviously very wet. I tried
to put some up but it was coming apart in the liquid. I was worried I would
lose lots of cells but trying to scoop it up from the liquid so we decided to
turn the centrifuge back on and let it run for a little longer to see if this
got rid of the liquid.

After running it for a few minutes we opened it up again. The liquid drained
out of the centre bowl this time but the cell pellet look more runny and it
looked like there was less there. We noticed the liquid coming out of the bowl
was very thick with cells so we captured this and spun it in the lab to see
how much we were losing here (about half of this liquid was spilled so only
some was able to be spun).
