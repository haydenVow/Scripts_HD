### Process:

1\. Took image of vessel with microscope on phase setting.

3\. Aliquotted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then
placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath for a minimum of 20 minutes
prior to use:

  1. TrypLE:     15    mL in     1    tubes
  2.  dPBS (for washing and neutralising):     30    mL in   1     tube
  3. Growth media (for pellet resuspension):      4   mL in     1    tubes

Time that all aliquots were placed in the water bath the warm before use    9
:34   am

Note: if aliquots were placed in water bath at different time, record the time
stamp for each individual solution.




4\. Removed vessel(s) from the incubator     10:15   a/pm

5\. Washed the vessel(s) with dPBS (warmed).

6\. Added    15     mL tryple to each vessel/well and incubated at 37ËšC.

  1. Start/Finish for TrypLE was    10:20  am 

7\. Neutralised with      15mL    dPBS and combined cell suspension into a
50mL     tube.

8\. Centrifuged at 650 x g for 5 min.

  1. Start/Finish time for centrifugation was    10:35 am 




9\. Aspirated the supernatant(s).

10\. Resuspended pellet(s) in   4   mL   Growth   media    10:46 am

Stored on ice
