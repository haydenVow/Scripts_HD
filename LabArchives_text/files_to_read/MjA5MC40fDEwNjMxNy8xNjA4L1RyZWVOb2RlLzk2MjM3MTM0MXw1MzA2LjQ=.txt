Growth Media:

  * [X]  DMEM/F12 + 20% FBS + 1X P/S + P38i (10uM)

Total media required: 10mL

Total p38i required: 5uL

  




Process:

1\. Thawed and added 5uL of P38i to 10mL aliquot of Growth Media

Placed aliquotted   10mL  mL of  Growth Media into in water bath   10:17 am

2\. Removed   150 uL of Growth media from columns 3-10.

3\. Replaced with  150 uL (per well/per vessel) of  Growth   media.

4\. Returned vessel to incubate at: 11:31am
