Note 1.  

Nuvonis recommend using spinner flasks however we do not have a magnetic
stirrer that can go in the incubator. Instead we will perform the expansion in
e-Flasks. Because we only have large e-flask with flat bottoms (not baffled
which helps to prevent cell aggregation), the initial expansion will be
performed in e-125 flask, for which we have both baffle and flat bottom flasks
in house. n order to assess the affects of flat bottom flask on aggregation of
these cells, we will seed half of the cells into baffle, and half into flat
bottom flasks.

Note 2.

I forgot to add growth factors to media when seeding. Came back and added at
8.30pm (3hrs after re-seeding)

  1. Warm 100 ml SCGM in the 37C water bath 15:57
  2. Transfer cells from the T75 flasks into a 50 ml centrifuge tube and centrifuge for 10 min at 310 g 17:10
  3. Remove supernatant and resuspend cells in 10 ml SCGM by pipetting with a serological 10 ml pipette. 
  4. Sample for cell count and perform a cell count

Total cells: 1.46M. Much lower than expected. Didn't want to stray too far
from the recommended protocol, so decided to seed into 80mL instead of the
recommended 100.

  5. Added 70mL to the remaining pre-warmed media to the cells
  6. Transfer cells to 2 x e-125 flasks with a baffle bottom and 2 x e-125 flasks with a flat bottom (20mL each)
  7. Transfer flask to incubator (37C, 5% CO2, 120rpm)  17:39




### Observations/Summary:

Like yesterday when we thawed the cells, the count is much lower than
expected, despite re-mixing the cells, and taking a 2nd count. Given there was
supposed to be 7.5M cells in the vial, this low number is concerning. Didnt
want to stray too far from the reccomended protocol, so seeded in 80mL instead
of the recommended 100.
