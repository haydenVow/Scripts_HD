Culture ID  
Cell count  
  
10800 HyCell CHO  
2,280,000  
  
10801 RPMI  
360,000  
  
10802 DMEM/F12  
360,000  
  
10803 FreeStyle  
7,440,000  


  
  
Observations/Summary:

Very few cells visible in D/F and RPMI- cells had formed a ring around the
circumference of the flask, likely clumping together and sticking to the
surface  

HyCell looks pretty good but quite clumpy
