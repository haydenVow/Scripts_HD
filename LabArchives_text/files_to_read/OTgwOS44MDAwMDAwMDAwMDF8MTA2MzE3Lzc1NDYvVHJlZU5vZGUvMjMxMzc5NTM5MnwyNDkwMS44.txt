### Process:

Aliquotted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then
placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath for a minimum of 20 minutes
prior to use, growth media was added directly to destination wells on 6 well
plates, 1 plate for PABPC1 clones d5A, 5D, 5E and 6C, one plate for
PABPC1+PTEN clones 1C, 1F and 2F.  

  1. TrypLE:     0.05mL per 96 well   
  2.  dPBS (for washing):    0.1mL per 96 well   
  3. Growth media (for seeding):     1mL per destination 6 well     

Aliquots were left at room temperature before use.




Passaging of each 24 well  

1\. Aspirated the supernatant and discard  

2\. wash with 0.1mL dPBS and remove supernat  

3\. pipette in 0.05 mL tryple

4\. incubate at 30 degrees for 8 mins  

6\. retrieve plates containing tryple and pipette up and down a few times to
ensure all cells have been lifted.

8\. Transfer cell volume directly to destination well on 24 well plate.

9\. Place 24 well plate in incubator at 30 degrees, 5% CO2.

  

  




Notes:

11 clones were picked for IGFBP4+AQP1 and 12 clones were picked for
IGFBP4+ZIC1

All clones picked were added to the same 24 well plate, Rows 1 and 2
containing IGFBP4+AQP1 clones and Rows 3 and 4 containing IGFBP4+ZIC1 clones.

Wells were labelled on the 24 well plate according to their origin well number
of the clone they contain, I.e if the clone was picked from well G8 on the 96
well plate, the label would now be 'G8' going forward.

Plate map of the destination well plate is as follows.
