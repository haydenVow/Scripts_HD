Aim/Purpose


To compare suspension adaptation of fibroblast CHOMP cells in various medium
conditions in E125 flasks.


Hypothesis


Cells will adapt to suspension (increasing cells/mL will be achieved) in at
least one medium condition in E125 flasks.


Technical Gap


Vow has not tried adapting cells to suspension in 24 deep well plates before.
It is important to compare cell growth in these vessels with E125 flasks
throughout the suspension adaptation process. This will ensure that any
failure to adapt cells is due to cells or media formulations, rather than the
types of vessels used.

This experiment will also help to identify a media formulation for adapting
CHOMP cells so that large scale expansion can occur to create Vow's first
product.

D0: Seed cells into 2CFs for adherent slow adaptation and scale up

Thaw a total of 42 million F_CHOMP09 cells into 2x2CFs in D/F + 20% FBS + 1x
P/S to grow up > 84 M

Thaw a total of 21 million F_DOLLY12 vials into 1x2CFs in D/F + 10% FBS + 1x
P/S to grow up > 42 M (for positive control).

D3/4: 50% Medium change with suspension media  

Perform 50% change of each flask into the matching suspension basal media
after 3-4 days

D7: Passage cells into suspension culture in 24 dwp, 50 mL shake tubes, and
E125 flasks

Seed 3 replicates for each condition, 500 000 cells/mL and shake on MaxQ
shaker (19 mm orbital diameter)

24 DWP: 1.25 M cells in 2.5 mL per well, 300 rpm

50 mL tubes: 2.5 million cells in 5 mL per tube, 206 rpm

E125 flasks: 10 million cells in 20 mL, 120 rpm (speed should be tested with
20 mL of water)

feed.

OT2 Feed

Perform 75% media changes twice per week by centrifuging cell suspensions at
300xg for 5 minutes, discard the supernatant and re-suspend cells in their
respective growth medias. Transfer 100 uL of resuspended sample into 96 well
plate for imaging and cell counts.

Cell counts

Add 100 uL of stain buffer (Hoechst 33342 Readyflow) to the cells and incubate
at room temperature and in the dark for 30 minutes. Prepare serial dilutions
(50%, 25%, 12.5%) of the stained cell preparation in subsequent wells,
diluting with dPBS. Image all wells using the Zaber and analyse using MIA.
