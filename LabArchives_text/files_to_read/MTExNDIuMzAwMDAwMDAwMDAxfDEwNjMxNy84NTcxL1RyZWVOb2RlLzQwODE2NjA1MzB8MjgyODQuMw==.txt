RELATED TO OKR: Develop process for manufacturing Morsel: satisfy regulatory
requirements to demonstrate no/limited genetic drift in cells during
bioprocess.  

AIM/PURPOSE: to demonstrate that Nuvonis cells undergo no/limited genetic
drift during bioprocess. Cells will be collected and processed for DNA
extraction at start (WCB) and end (following x2 shake flask culture passages
and x2 in a stir-tank reactor (STR) passages) points during our bioprocess

HYPOTHESIS: cells will exhibit no genetic changes between start and end
sampling time points

RESULTS SUMMARY:

CONCLUSIONS:
