## Performed by: Jared Bergman  




Perform feed using below volumes:

  




Differentiation Media:

  * E6  
  
Total media required: 24 mL

Media is aliquot is pre-prepared and located in the main lab media/gelatin
fridge (#74). It is in a black 50mL falcon tube labelled with 'SUN EStim' on
the top and 'E6 EPIC21489 TEST 1 M6318' on the side.

Process:

1\. Aliquoted  1x 24 mL  mL of  E6 Dif Media into  1x 50mL  tube(s). Labelled
aliquots with the feed date and 'EPIC21489'.  
Placed aliquots in media fridge 74 in main lab 15:00 03/08  

Media is aliquot is pre-prepared and located in the main lab media/gelatin
fridge (#74). It is in a black 50mL falcon tube labelled with 'SUN EStim' on
the top and 'E6 EPIC21489 TEST 1 M6318' on the side.  
  
2\. Aliquots placed in water bath 9:55am - 11:45  

3\. Removed the hook test clips from the electrode connection pins on the
culture dish lid and moved culture dish to the BSC.  time  
  
The test hook can be released from the pin by squeezing the spring loaded test
hook handle. It is best not to touch the metal electrode pins while doing
this. Hold the plastic culture dish lid for stability. If any wires become
dislodged and the operator is unsure about reattachment, contact experiment
owner for assistance   Jared - 0420881185  

4\. Removed and placed the electrode culture lid on its back inside the
incubator to keep the electrodes sterile.

5\.  100% of supernatant from the vessel was removed.

6\. Replaced with  2mL (per well/per vessel) of  E6 Dif  media.

7\. Returned vessel to incubate and connected the test hooks back up to the
electrode pins on the culture dish lid so that each set of hooks connects to
the corresponding wire colour and so that the black hooks are aligned on the
left side of each well and the red hooks on the right (see wiring setup
reference image below)   11:55
