Process

  1. Aliquoted 1 mL of growth medium (D/F + 10%FBS + 1xP/S) and placed in water bath : - :
  2. Removed plate from incubator and observed under microscope
    * Most cells have again stuck down, very small proportion remain floating in medium. Not sure if there will be enough viable cells floating to survive. Might have to retry with a larger original vessel for higher probability of getting viable suspension cells. 
  3.  Using a 1 mL pipette, gently pipette mixed culture in well, then transferred to a microtube 
  4. Centrifuged microtube at 650 x g for 5 minutes 12:11 - 12:16 
  5. Removed 50% of supernatant (1 mL) 
  6. Replaced with 1 mL of fresh growth medium 
  7. Transferred cell suspension to new well in 24-WP 
  8. Replaced plate in incubator
