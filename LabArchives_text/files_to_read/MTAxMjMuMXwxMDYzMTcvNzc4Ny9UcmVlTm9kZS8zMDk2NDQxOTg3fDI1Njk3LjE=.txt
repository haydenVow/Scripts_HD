Process:

  1. Placed the  50 mL aliquot of  Growth Media in the bead bath set at 37 C for 20 minutes or until warm to the touch.
  2. Removed  15 mL (50%) supernatant from each vessel (you can use the same tip for the ZIC 1E 2 x T175 as they contain the same single cell clones BUT please change tips when handling ZIC 2C flask).
  3. Replaced with 15 mL of growth media per well/per vessel  (please change tips to feed each T175, including between the ZIC 1E 2 x T175, in order to avoid cross-contaminating the media).
  4. Returned vessel to incubate at: 10:23am
