Process


Note: procedure based on document attached below

  1. Removed JC-1 from freezer and allowed to come to room temperature 13:14
  2. In BSC, dissolve entire 5 mg of JC-1 product in 3.8 mL DMSO to generate 200 uM stock solution (100X) 
  3. Aliquot into 19 x 200 uL aliquots and store 18 x vials at -20'C 
    1. Calcs for diltuion: 0.5 uL per well stock solution (50 uL per well, 1:100) - need 200 uL stock solution per plate. Make a 1:20 dilution of stock solution (200 uL JC-1 + 3800 uL media), then add 10 uL to each well (1:5), final Cconc 1:100 to make 1X concentration 
  4. Using the remaining 19th vial, add 10 uL of stain per well to each test well of 1 x 384-wp
  5. Leave to incubate in the incubator for 15 minutes 
  6. Measure fluorescence at 488nm on Zaber microscope. If no signal is detected, incubate for longer (up to 3H) 
  7. Record observations.
