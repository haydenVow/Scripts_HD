Counting & sampling process
  
  
  1. Retrieved a random selection of 10 x E125s from the incubator and transferred to BSC
  2. Transferred 550 uL samples from each flask into ViCell counting cups
  3. Put aside any cups with samples from flasks #1-6 and #16-21 for glucose testing.
  4. Loaded 525uL samples onto the Vicell and loaded the remaining 25uL of cell suspension into the mixing well (Row D) of a Cellaca MX plate.
  5. Repeated steps 1-4 with remaining flasks.
  6. Tested glucose levels in samples from flasks #1-6 and #16-21 using Accu-Chek Instant S blood glucose meter:
    1. Insert the metallic end of a test strip into the meter. The meter will turn on. 
    2. When a flashing drop symbol appeared, took 1 x 5 uL sample from 510 uL aliquot using P20 pipette 
    3. Ejected drop onto gloved fingertip (to mimic a drop of blood when doing a finger prick test) 
    4. Touch the yellow edge of the test strip to the drop of media. Remove your finger from the test strip when the flashing hourglass symbol appears. Do not put sample on top of the test strip.
    5. Copy value into table below
  7. Mixed 25uL of cell suspension in each well of the Cellaca MX plate with 25uL of trypan blue for counting on the CELLACA MX.


Feeding process


  

  1. For flasks 1-3 recording 4.5 g/L glucose or less:
    1. Added glucose stock solution to bring glucose levels up to 7 g/L, so 187.5uL glucose per flask (75 uL = 1 g/L)
    2. For ala-gln, the volume added will depend on how many days have passed since the last feed or top-up. 
      1. If 1 day has passed, add 150 uL per flask (1 mM)
      2. If 2 days have passed, add 300 uL per flask (2 mM) 
      3. If 3 days have passed, add 450 uL per flask (3 mM)
      4. Etc.
  2. For flasks 4-6 recording 3 g/L glucose or less:
    1. Added glucose stock solution to bring glucose levels up to 7 g/L, so 300uL glucose per flask (75 uL = 1 g/L)
    2. For ala-gln, the volume added will depend on how many days have passed since the last feed or top-up. 
      1. If 1 day has passed, add 150 uL per flask (1 mM)
      2. If 2 days have passed, add 300 uL per flask (2 mM) 
      3. If 3 days have passed, add 450 uL per flask (3 mM)
      4. Etc. 
  3. For flasks 16-18 recording 4.5 g/L glucose or less:
    1. Added glucose stock solution to bring glucose levels up to 7 g/L, so 187.5uL glucose per flask (75 uL = 1 g/L)
  4. For flasks 19-21 recording 3 g/L glucose or less:
    1. Added glucose stock solution to bring glucose levels up to 7 g/L, so 300uL glucose per flask (75 uL = 1 g/L)
  5. Recorded which flasks were fed in table below

Flask 13 was sampled 3 times but there was a camera error on the Vicell all
three times.
