microscope to assess confluence.

Decided to passage the flask given the confluence was high.

  1. Media was poured off the cells 
  2. 200mL of dPBS wash was pipetted into the flask using a 50mL pipette (aliquot 13372)
  3. Wash was poured off the cells
  4. 200mL of 1xTryple-EDTA was added back to the cells using a 50mL pipette (Tryple mix13395)
  5. Flask was returned to incubate for 12 minutes at 30 degrees, 5% CO2. 
  6. Once cells were confirmed detached by inspection under the microscope, Trypalised cells were collected into 50mL tubes (25mL per tube) 
  7. 200uL of dPBS wash was added back to the flask, the wash was then collected into the same tubes containing the tryaplised cells (25mL per tube) (400mL total volume collected)
  8. Cells were centrifuged at 650g for 5 minutes 
  9. Supernatants were removed and cells were resuspended each in 5mL of growth media per tube
  10. Cells were pooled into one tube and empty tubes were washed with 5mL of growth media, wash was transferred to each empty tube before being combined with the remaining cell collection (45mL of cell suspension) 
  11. 3x10uL aliquots were taken for cell counting using a hemocytometer, mixing 1:2 with trypan blue. (https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1DPzKubYxfHmWogVPihC-SSIBtIylyrBQE5kRX5Z8NtI/edit#gid=0&range=2696:2699)
    1. Average cell count:  39,180,000 cells in 45 mL. 
  12. The entire cell suspension was transferred to a container of DMEM/F12+20%FBS+1xP/S (final volume 700mL) (mix 13409)
  13. This cell suspension was transferred to a 5CF (10,283 cells/cm^2) Culture 13238. 
  14. Cell stack was placed in incubator 68, 30 degrees, 5% CO2.
