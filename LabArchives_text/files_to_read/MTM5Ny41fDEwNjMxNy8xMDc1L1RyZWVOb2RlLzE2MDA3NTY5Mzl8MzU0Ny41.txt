## Performed by: Nathan  




Growth Media:

  * [x]  DMEM/F12 + 20% FBS + 1X P/S + P38i (10uM)

Total media required: 92mL

Total p38i required: 46ul

Process:

1\. Aliquotted   92mL  mL of  growth Media into   1x120mL    pot. Placed in
water bath   12:30 a/pm

2\. Stopped the shaker and removed cultures from the incubator before
restarting the shaker   12:35 a/pm

3\. Placed suspension flask(s) inside the BSC and allowed to sit static for
3-5 minutes to allow microcarriers to settle to the base of the flask.

2\. Carefully removed  50  % of supernatant from the flask(s) by pipetting
slowly and following the meniscus with the pipette tip so as to avoid placing
the pipette tip near the microcarriers at the base of the flask(s).

3\. Replaced with  60 mL (6768)  30 mL  (6769) of   growth  media.

4\. Returned vessel to incubate at:   12:45 a/pm , incubator #  68  , shaking
at 110rpm

  * [x]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (aviary cells)
