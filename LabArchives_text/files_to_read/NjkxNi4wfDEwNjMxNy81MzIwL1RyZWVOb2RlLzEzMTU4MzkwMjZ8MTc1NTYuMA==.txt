Instruction


Components


Consumables

  1. Stainless steel tie wire - Grade 304. 0.5mm diameter. Minimum XX m required for 1 x 24WP.  
  
Note: PtIr (90-10 or 80-20) 1st preference for electrode material, then 100%
Pt, 100% Gold, sputtered TiO2 .... then stainless steel (316), then stainless
steel (304) in order of preference.  
  

  2. 24 well-plate culture dish.
  3. Translucent silicone adhesive.
  4. 24 WP culture dish

Tools

  1. Pliers.
  2. Wire cutters.
  3. Drill with 0.5 mm drill bit.
  4. A measuring ruler.
  5. A small bench vice.
  6. Whiteboard marker

PPE

  1. Safety glasses (optional)
  2. Gloves (optional)


Process

  1.  Cutting the electrodes  
  
1.1 Unwind and straighten out the stainless steel tie wire (Grade 304, 0.5mm
diameter)  
1.2 Using the measuring ruler, mark the stainless steel tie wire (Grade 304,
0.5mm diameter) with the whiteboard marker at 35 mm in length.  
1.3 Using the wire cutters, cut the stainless steel tie wire (Grade 304, 0.5mm
diameter) at the 35 mm mark.  
1.4 Using the measuring ruler, mark the freshly cut 35 mm long stainless steel
tie wire (Grade 304, 0.5mm diameter) with the whiteboard marker at 10 mm in
length (Figure 1).

304, 0.5mm diameter) with the whiteboard marker at 10 mm in length.  
.

 1.5 Position the stainless steel tie wire (Grade 304, 0.5mm diameter) piece
in the small bench vice so 10 mm is clamped in the vice up to the mark, with
25 mm sticking out of the vice (Figure 2).

placed in the small bench vice so 10 mm is clamped in the vice up to the mark,
with 25 mm sticking out of the vice.  

1.6 Use the pliers or your fingers to pull the wire into an L shape.  
1.7 Using the measuring ruler, ensure the short part of the L shaped electrode
is 10 mm long at the straight component and no longer than 14 mm including the
the length of the curved corner (Figure 3).

2\. Drilling the electrode holes in the culture plate lid

2.1 Using the measuring ruler, measure XX mm down from the top of one 24 WP
culture dish well circle in the lid, and mark a horizontal line from one edge
of the circle to the other. X mm from the edge of the circle, mark a spot to
drill (Figure 4)

each well.  
  
2.2 Place a disposable notepad underneath the lid and slowly drill through the
culture dish lid (Figure 5) using a 0.5 mm drill bit in the locations marked
in step 2.1 (Figure 4). The electrode wire is 0.5 mm diameter so it pushing
and pulling the drill back and forth 4 to 8 times is required to open the hole
by the extra 0.1 mm. This enables a snug fit with the electrode but prevents
the electrode cracking the lid by being too large. Care should be taken not to
open the hole too wide so the electrode fit is no longer snug.

3\. Positioning the electrodes

3.1 For each electrode required, push the long end of the L shaped electrode
through the hole in the culture dish lid. The fit should be snug and prevent
the electrode from falling out when released.

3.2 Push each electrode in so that the electrode with the bend protrudes 15 mm
from the inside of the lid (Figure 6).

inside of the lid.

 3.3 Align the electrodes so they are straight and parallel in the well plate
and check they site approximately 2 mm above the base of the well (Figure 7).

4\. Sealing the Electrodes

4.1 Squeeze some silicone into a 5 mL tube from the back and push in the
plunger.

4.2 Squeeze some silicone from the 5 mL tube onto a piece of stainless steel
tie wire (Grade 304, 1.6mm diameter) and place the silicone around the exit
point of each electrode on the exterior facing side of the lid (Figure 8).

on the top side of the lid.

  

4.3 Allow the silicone to cure overnight in air at room temperature.




5\. Process Complete

5.1 The EStim culture dish lid is ready to be sterilised and connected to the
stimulator.
