Aim/Purpose


To determine the maximum cell density (cells/mL) that can be achieved in
different ratios of RPMI/CHO-in-1 media and determine which formulation yields
the highest number of cells per dollar of media


Hypothesis
Technical Gap


The maximum cell density (cells/mL) that CHO-in-1 medium can support has thus
far not been tested. Given our goal is to maximise output (cell yield) per
cost of inputs (primarily growth media), we want to determine the maximum
density that different RPMI/CHO-in-1 ratios can achieve. This will inform the
optimal media formulation for maximising cells per $ which we will take
forward to manufacturing.


Method/Procedure


  1. Day 0 (Friday 3/6/22) Seed cells (2M in 30 mL) in the following conditions (3 reps/E-125s per condition). Note that cells in conditions 1, 2, and 4 will be seeded from cells in the same condition, while condition 3 will be seeded with cells from 50/50 media (sourced from Eva's slow adaptation experiment)
    1. Condition 1: 0/100% RPMI/CHO-in-1 
    2. Condition 2: 50/50% RPMI/CHO-in-1
    3. Condition 3: 75/25% RPMI/CHO-in-1
    4. Condition 4: 90/10% RPMI/CHO-in-1
  2. Day 3 (Monday 6/6/22) Perform cell counts for all flasks and record density (cells/mL). Perform 100% feed on all flasks by centrifuging, removing supernatant, and replacing with 20 mL of fresh media. Do not remove any cells during the feed process. Check pH of spent media for each condition and record.
  3. Day 4 (Tuesday 7/6/22) Perform cell counts for all flasks and record density (cells/mL). Do not feed flasks.
  4. Day 5 (Wednesday 8/6/22) Perform cell counts for all flasks and record density (cells/mL). Perform 100% feed on all flasks by centrifuging, removing supernatant, and replacing with 20 mL of fresh media. Do not remove any cells during the feed process. Check pH of spent media for each condition and record. 
  5. Day 6 (Thursday 9/6/22) Perform cell counts for all flasks and record density (cells/mL). Do not feed flasks.
  6. Day 7 (Friday 10/6/22) Perform cell counts for all flasks and record density (cells/mL). Perform 100% feed on all flasks by centrifuging, removing supernatant, and replacing with 20 mL of fresh media. Do not remove any cells during the feed process. Check pH of spent media for each condition and record.
