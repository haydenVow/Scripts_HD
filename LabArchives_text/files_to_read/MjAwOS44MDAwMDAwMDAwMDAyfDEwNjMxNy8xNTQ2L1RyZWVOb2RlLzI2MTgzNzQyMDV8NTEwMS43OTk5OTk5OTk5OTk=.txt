Took samples

  1. Unscrewed the "BENCHMARK" sample tube cover.
  2. Sprayed down the tube end with 70% ethanol.
  3. Connected a 5 mL sterile syringe.
  4. Withdrew slightly more than 3 mL (to purge the line).
  5. Discarded the 5 mL syringe.
  6. Connected a fresh sterile syringe and withdrew sample.
  7. Disconnected sample syringe and transferred sample to vessel(s) for subsequent analysis.
    1. 3 x 1 mL aliquots in 3x 1.5 mL Eppendorf tubes
  8. Sprayed sample tube end and cap with 70% ethanol, re-attached cap.

Stained and imaged cells adhered to microcarriers

  1. Added 1 drop of Hoechst 33342 readyprobes reagent to each tube
  2. Vortexed at minimum power for 30 seconds
  3. Left the tubes to incubate at room temperature, in the dark (away from light), for XX minutes.  `| 15:25 - 15:27 |`
  4. `Added 3 x 80 uL of dPBS to 3` x wells of a 96 well plate
  5. `After incubation, transferred 20 uL from each tube to a well containing 80 uL of dPBS `
  6. The wells were inspected under the Axio microscope, 5x objective.
  7. Using https://mia-capture.vow.tools/#/, 2-3 sets of same frame images using the DAPI and PHASE channels were captured for each well `| 1:00 - 16:10 |`
    1. Fluorescence intensity of the UV lamp was adjusted until the centre of each microcarrier was barely visible compared to the space between microcarriers.
  8. Once images were captured, Image pairs were assigned a 'location ID' in MIA capture. 
  9. Images captured were then selected for analysis using the 'uCarrier cell count plastic' tool from MIA capture. 

  

NOTE: Very few carriers seen so 100ul sample from each tube imaged instead.
Some microcarriers seen but very few cells on them.




NOTE

A second 3ml sample was retrieved from the biostat as before and 100ul was
checked under 5x phase in 96WP well.

There was more microcarriers present in this sample. The amount present in
this sample was as expected. This suggests the first sample was not
representative of the biostat culture. However, there were still not many
cells present on the microcarriers so the nuclear ejection was deemed not
worthwhile. This was decided by operator Jared Bergman after consulting Tom
Tarrento and Nathan Hawkins.

  




### Observations/Summary:

### Low confluence on microcarriers. Nuclear ejection postponed due to lack of
cells present.
