## Performed by: Shaleen Sharma  







Reagent preparation:

1\. Prepared Secondary Antibody mixes (pipette from the top/supernatant of
antibody solution):

(1;100,000 dilution antibody mixes were made from a 1:10 serial dilution of a
1:10,000 mix)

If using AlexaFluor secondary antibodies then the max concentration should be
1:500 (typically used at 1:1000)

Pipette-mixed antibody mix and stored refrigerated away from light until
needed.




Process:

1\. Removed plate from fridge (incubated in primary antibodies overnight).

2\. Washed 3 times for 5 min with PBS at RT.

 12:04 - 12:09 a/pm

 12:11 - 12:16 a/pm

 12:18 - 12:23 a/pm

3\. Incubated the cells with secondary antibody mixture in the dark at RT for
1 hour.  12:36 - 13:46 a/pm

NOTE: from this step onwards protect from the light by wrapping plates in foil
and perform experiment in the dark.




Addition of TMB substrate:

1\.  Removed 2nd antibody solution.  13:48 a/pm

2\.  Washed in 200uL PBS 5 x 5 min at RT in the dark. (No Triton)

 13:50 - 13:55 a/pm

 13:56 - 14:01 a/pm

 14:03 - 14:08 a/pm

 14:10 - 14:15 a/pm

 14:17 - 14:23 a/pm  

4\. Started peroxidase reaction by adding 75uL of TMB substrate solution to
respective wells (see Figure 1 for plate map) and incubating plate at RT for
15 mins.

 15:00 - 15:15 a/pm (p1)  

 15:02 - 15:17 a/pm  (p2)



5\. Quenched reaction with 75uL of 0.5M HCl strictly after 15 minutes and
observed cyan to yellow colour change.

6\. Pipette mixed and transferred 100uL of the yellow supernatant to a new
non-treated 96 well plate.

7\. Placed plate in NanoStar plate reader and measured absorbance values at
450nm




Janus Green:

  1. Aspirated supernatant and washed each plate thrice with 200uL PBS.
  2. Add 1X Janus Green Stain (0.3% solution in PBS) (#M4399) per well, sufficient to cover the cells (100uL in this case for a 96 well plate) and incubate at RT for 5 minutes:
    1. Start:  16:22 - 16:27 (P1)
    2. 16:28 - 16:33 a/pm
  3. Remove dye, wash 5 times in deionized water (200uL each wash) or until excess dye is removed.
  4. Remove last water wash, add 100uL 0.5 M HCl and incubate for 10 min. 15:00 - 15:10 a/pm  15:02 - 15:12 a/pm  

  5. Transferred 50 uL of the stained supernatant into the wells of an untreated 96w plate and read absorbance at 605 nm using the NanoStar plate reader.

Observations/Summary:

Observations:

  * TMB substrate solution was placed in a plastic reservoir so that multichannel pipetting could happen with ease. However, after some time (~ 15 minutes) solution appeared to turn slightly blue over time despite that the solution was not exposed to cells.
  * During Janus Green washing steps, cell sheet at the bottom of the wells in the ingredient plate appeared to lift off.
  * Fluorescent control images show that cells have lifted on both left and right sides and even folded over in some cases. See: https://mia-capture.vow.tools/#/session/recD796FMhGahQqI5/images

### Results

  * Results were;
    * [ ]  As Usual (this is a repetitive task)
    * [ ]  Unexpected because...
    * [X]  Need to be further analysed
    * [ ]  Other (.......)
