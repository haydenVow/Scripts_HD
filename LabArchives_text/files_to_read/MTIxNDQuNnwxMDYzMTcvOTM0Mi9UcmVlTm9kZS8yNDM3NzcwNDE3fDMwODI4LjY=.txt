Imaged culture 13351 under 10x objective, Phase, using the primovert
microscope to assess confluence.

Decided to passage the flask given the confluence was high.

  1. Media was aspirated from the cells
  2. 5mL of dPBS wash was pipetted into the flask using a 10mL pipette (aliquot 13372)
  3. Wash was removed
  4. 5mL of 1xTryple-EDTA was added back to the cells using a 10mL pipette (Tryple mix13395)
  5. Flask was returned to incubate for 10 minutes at 30 degrees, 5% CO2. 
  6. Once cells were confirmed detached by inspection under the microscope, Trypalised cells were collected into a 50mL tube
  7. 10mL of dPBS wash was added back to the flask, the wash was then collected into the same tubes containing the tryaplised cells 
  8. Cells were centrifuged at 500g for 5 minutes 
  9. Supernatants were removed and cells were resuspended each in 12mL of growth media DMEM/F12+10%FBS+1xP/S 
  10. This cell suspension was transferred to a T75. 
  11. Cell stack was placed in incubator 140, 30 degrees, 5% CO2. culture ID, 13402
