1\.  Turn on water bath and set temperature to 37˚C.

2\. Take the flasks for harvest and observe under the microscope for even cell
distribution and 50% confluency. Take 5 images per flask. Refer to VSOP006_0

3\.  Aliquot required volume of dPBS (37C) 600ml , dPBS (ambient temp) 600ml,
TrypLE 600ml and growth media 5ml (9C) and 13ml (10C)into separate sterile
pots.

4\.  Place aliquots in pre-warmed water bath and leave for ~20 minutes or
until warmed. 10:50  

NOTE - use the warmed dPBS is to wash the flask before the Tryple, this way we
don't cool down the flask before adding the warm tryple, so must ensure this
is warmed properly, also the tryple must be warmed properly before adding to
the flasks because the size of the 4CFs means that the 10 mins in the
incubator won't be enough to heat it all up and get the enzyme working




5\.  Transfer aliquots and flasks required for harvest into the BSC, ensuring
to wipe down containers with 70% EtOH during the transfer.  

6\. Unscrew white cap and remove blue cap from 4CF and place aside (high and
out of way within the BSC) carefully pour all of the media from the flask into
a 500ml waste pot.

(refer to this youtube vid to see how they pour out the growth media if you
are unsure:

7\.  Replace with  200 mL (per flask) of warmed dPBS by carefully pouring
through the white cap opening (alternatively you may use a 50mL serological to
add)

8\.  Screw caps back on and equalise each 4CF by placing it on its side (blue
cap on the bottom and white cap on the top, see image below:

9\.  Once flask has been washed carefully pour the dPBS into a 500ml waste
container.

10\.  Add/pour 200ml of pre-warmed TrypLE into each 4CF, equalise (as
explained above).

11\.  Incubate at 37˚C for 10 min. Timestamp: 11:22 - 11:33




12\.  After 5 minutes, remove flasks and observe for 95-100% dissociation of
cells under the microscope. If needed incubate further until maximum
dissociation level is reached.

NOTE: The flasks must be removed from the incubator within 10 minutes of
initial incubation of TrypLE containing flasks.  

13\.  Return flasks to the BSC, unscrew lids and place aside, then carefully
pour out the TrypLE solution from the flasks and collect into a sterile 500ml
container. Next, distribute the tryple/cell mix with a serological pipette
into 20 x 50 mL (labelled). The number of tubes will depend on amount of
flasks used for the harvest (8 tubes per 4CF).

14\.  Carefully pour  100ml of ambient dPBS into each flask, screw on lids,
equalise and wash flask (as explained above), gently mix then remove lids and
aspirate the entire volume by carefully pouring into a 500ml collection pot.
Refer to volumes required from above Table. Then distribute with a serological
pipette into 16x 50mL centrifuge tubes(labelled).

15\.  Repeat previous 100ml  PBS wash step




16\.  Centrifuge tubes at 650 x g for 5 minutes. Start time 11:47 - 11:52

17\.  Gently remove centrifuge tubes ensuring not to disturb the suspended
pellets and aspirate the supernatant from the tubes. Discard supernatant.
Remove remaining supernatant with a 1mL pipette.

Cells are now harvested.




18\.  Resuspend pellets and collect into 1x 50ml tube in  12.5 mL 10C (LL &
BT) and 4.9 mL 9C (AB)

19\. Perform 2x cell counts per harvest from two separate samples of the
suspension using a hemocytometer

LL & BT:

Cell count 1: 24,000,000

Cell count 2: 28,950,000

Cell count 3: 23,750,000

Average: 25,566,667

AB:

Cell count 1: 13,465,200

Cell count 2: 13,328,000

Average: 13,396,600

Note: LL & BT needed 33M for their experiment. AB had 5.9M leftover. AB
donated excess cells to LL & BT.

Final BT & LL cell count: 31,400,000  




Observations/Summary:

\- Expected 36-40M cells from 4x2CFs so unsure as to why the cell count was
lower

\- Reduced reps to n=3 and seeded at 0.5, 0.7 and 1.3M cells per scaffold

### Results:

  * Results were;
    * [ ]  As Usual (this is a repetitive task)
    * [x]  Unexpected because...expected more cells
    * [ ]  Need to be further analysed
    * [ ]  Other (.......)
