NOTE: Cells were spun at 300g instead of 650 in an effort to reduce the amount
of debris in the cultures.







7218-F-DOLLY12-Sheep P10-of : 1:100 Anti-clumping agent + RGD peptide  
7219-F-DOLLY12-Sheep P10-of : 1:100 Anti-clumping agent + YIGSR peptide  
7220-F-DOLLY12-Sheep P10-of : 1:100 Anti-clumping agent control  
7221-F-DOLLY12-Sheep P10-of : 1:100 Anti-clumping agent (low serum)




Process:  

1\. Place 10 mL  mL of each respective type of Growth Media into the water
bath   14:00  

2\. Placed shake tubes in centrifuge and centrifuge at 300 x g for 5 min at
RT.   14:05 (7218),14:45 for others  

3\. Aspirated supernatant from each pellet

4\. Added 1mL of respective growth media to each tube and used a P1000 pipette
to break up cell clumps.

5\. 20uL of each culture taken for viability check- see cell count spreadsheet
here: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1DPzKubYxfHmWogVPihC-
SSIBtIylyrBQE5kRX5Z8NtI/edit#gid=1526857572

6\. Remaining 9mL of each respective media was added afterwards and triturated
with 10mL serological pipette to break up cell clumps for each culture further
and resuspend cells evenly.

4\. Returned 4 x vessel to incubate at:  14:15 (7218), 15:40 for others
Shaking at 206 RPM
