Process

  1. Aliquoted 2 mL of growth medium (D/F + 10%FBS + 1xP/S) and placed in water bath 13:34 - 13:40
  2. Removed plate from incubator and observed under microscope
    * Many cells have stuck down, and small proportion remain floating in medium. This is in line with what was reported in the research paper this experiment is based on. 
  3.  Using a 1 mL pipette, gently pipette mixed culture in well, then transferred to a microtube 
  4. Centrifuged microtube at 650 x g for 5 minutes 13:28 - 13:33
  5. Removed half of supernatant (1 mL) 
  6. Replaced with 1 mL of fresh growth medium 
  7. Transferred cell suspension to new well in 24-WP 
  8. Replaced plate in incubator
