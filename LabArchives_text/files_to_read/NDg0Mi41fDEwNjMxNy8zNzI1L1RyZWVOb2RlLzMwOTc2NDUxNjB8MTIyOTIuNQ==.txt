### Process:

1\. Zaber scanned the plate (5x, Phase).

2\. Added 3 mL of growth media to 1 well of 6 well plate. Added 0.5 mL growth
media to 6 wells of a 24 well plate.

  1. Time when all vessels(s) placed into the incubator      15 : 13  

3\. Aliquotted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then
placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath for a minimum of 20 minutes
prior to use:

  1. TrypLE:     2    mL in      1   tubes
  2.  dPBS (for washing):      4   mL

Time that all aliquots were placed in the water bath the warm before use    15
: 24  

Note: if aliquots were placed in water bath at different time, record the time
stamp for each individual solution.




4\. Removed vessel(s) from the incubator    15 : 26  

5\. Washed the vessel(s) with dPBS (warmed). (500uL/well)

6\. Added      0.2   mL tryple to each vessel/well and incubated at 37˚C.

  1. Start/Finish for TrypLE was    15 :39 - 15:54    




13\. Neutralised wells by adding 500uL of growth media from the destination
well. Mixed the cell suspension and transferred it to the destination well
~approx 16 :00

4 mL more of growth media was warmed for 5 min 16:08 - 16:13. This was used to
add 500uL/well to each well of the new  24 wp.

16\. Transferred vessel(s) to incubate at: 16:17

  * [X]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (avian cells)




Observations/Summary:

Passaged 7 wells from 24 well plate #7857

well A3 -> 6 well plate

remaining wells into new 24 well plate:

B1 -> A1

B3 -> A2

B6 -> A3

C1 -> A4

C2 -> A5

D4 -> A6

The rest of the wells in the plate did not have adhered cells, mostly dead and
floating cells. Therefore, they were discarded.
