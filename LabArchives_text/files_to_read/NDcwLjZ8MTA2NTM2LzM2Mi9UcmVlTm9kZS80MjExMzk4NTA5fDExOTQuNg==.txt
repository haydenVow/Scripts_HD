Observations:

24hrs after seeding:

  * All roller bottles had a small amount of cell aggregation in the flasks, including the control (Some easily visible aggregates circled in pictures below). 
    * A lot of the cell aggregation occurred on the top rim near the bottle neck, but also some at the very bottom rim. 
    * There were 2 small floating aggregates visible in set 4, but for all flasks the majority of visible aggregate were still attached to the flask.
  * Cells were observed to have adhered, but there was also a lot of unattached cells. 
  * It should be noted that all flasks had semi tight lids except for set 5 which was quite loose, so there may not have been enough gas exchange? However, all flasks look very similar. 
    * All lids were loosened to the same extent this morning. 
  * It should also be noted that roller speed was set to 0.5rpm for these roller bottles*, which was different to the original setting of the roller bottles seeded for batch 015 (which was timed to be 0.125rpm, i.e. 8 mins per revolution.)  
*[on the Thermo roller a 0.5rpm for roller bottles is a speed setting of 2]

48hrs after seeding:

  * Set 1, 2, and 3 received a 100% media change at 24hrs after seeding, despite this more cell aggregation still formed (see pictures below)
    * These aggregates again formed mostly near the top rim and base rim of the bottles.
  * Confluence was estimated to be around 60-70%
    * Cell confluence is kind of patchy, looks like there are more cells near the rim and base where the aggregates are forming

72hrs after seeding:

  * Some aggregation still seen in all roller bottles 
    * Cell confluence is kind of patchy
    * The tiny aggregate balls are forming near the top rim and that's the area we are seeing more cells and more peeling
  * At D3 bottles (Sets) 2 and 3 are beginning to peel (circled in green below) - These will be harvested at D4.
    * Both of these bottle were treated at 24hrs (2 with VitC + TGFb, 3 with just VitC)

5 days after seeding:

  * Bottles (Sets) 4 and 5 began to show signs of peeling so were harvested at D5
  * The control (Bottle/set 1) showed no signs of peeling but was also harvested at D5 as it was the last remaining bottle

Bottle (Set) 1 - ControlBottle (Set) 4 - Seed with TGFb, add VitC @48hrsBottle
