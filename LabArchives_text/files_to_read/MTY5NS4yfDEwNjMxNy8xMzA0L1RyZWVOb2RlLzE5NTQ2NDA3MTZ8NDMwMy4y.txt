Janus Green staining

Plate previously fixed on 21/05/21 was removed from the biomaterials fridge
and PBS was removed.

Plate ID 6815

Notes: The addition of diluted hydrochloric acid easily and immediately leads
to dye elution from stained cell layers into the acidic supernatant which
consequently is transferred into 96-well plates and read on a microplate
reader at 595 nm.

Reagents:

  1. Janus Green 0.3% solution in PBS: Mix ID4399
  2. 0.5M HCl: Mix ID: 4400

Protocol:

  1. Remove any media from the plate containing the adherent cells. 
  2. Add 1X Janus Green Stain (0.3% solution in PBS) per well, sufficient to cover the cells = 0.5 mL in 24-well plate. 
    1. Start: 11:25-11:30
  3. Incubate for 5 min at room temperature.
  4. Remove dye, wash 5 times in deionized water (1 mL each wash) or until excess dye is removed.
  5. Remove last water wash, add 200ul 0.5 M HCl and incubate for 10 min. 11:56-12:06
  6. Transfer 150 uL of the stained HCL into the wells of an untreated 96w plate for plate reader assessment.
  7. Parafilmed plate and returned to the materials fridge to read absorbance later.
