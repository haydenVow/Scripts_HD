Background:  
  
We have not used the gelatex samples before. Gelatex suggested that the
samples be sterilised by either dry heat (150'C for 2 hours) or UV radiation.
In response to this we ordered a new dry heat oven and dry heat bags. The
following entries relate to the testing of the dry heat treatment on Gelatex
samples prior to experiment commencement.  
  
  
Method:  
  
          

\- Sprayed the gelatex scaffold sheets inside their sealed bags into the BSC

\- Cut off a piece from each sheet wih sterile scissors and placed into the
dry-heat nylon bags  
\- Placed in the dry heat oven at 150'C for 1 hour 10:30

\- Opened dry heat oven at 11:30  

Observations:  
  
After 1hr at 150'C the gelatin sample looked intact, whereas the zein scaffold
looked burnt and broke upon moving the bag (brittle>shattered). Also the nylon
bags had melted to each other and to the inside metal lining of the oven. This
could suggest that the oven is over-heating past the 150'C set-point as the
bags should be able to withstand these temperatures. An appropriate
temperature probe will be bought and the oven calibrated.  
  
Samples were discarded.  
  
Due to the potential over-heating the process was repeated on new scaffold
pieces at a reduced temperature of 120'C:

\- Sprayed the gelatex scaffold sheets in bags into the BSC

\- Cut off a piece from each sheet wih sterile scissors and placed into the
dry-heat nylon bags  
\- Placed in the dry heat oven at 120'C for 1 hour 13:45

\- Opened dry heat oven at 14:45

Observations:

The bags and samples were intact and not burnt.  
\- Turned on the dry heat for another hour at 15:00

  
Observations:  
After an additional hour the bags and samples were intact and not burnt. 16:05

samples were taken forward for stability testing under cell culture conditions
and later for test seeding with cells
