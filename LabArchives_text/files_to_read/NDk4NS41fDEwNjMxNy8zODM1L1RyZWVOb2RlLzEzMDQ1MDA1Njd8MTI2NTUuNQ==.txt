Important info:

***The main plate to feed has cells in all wells - feed this plate with the
DSD media block with all wells filled with media***  
  
*** Each well is a completely different media condition - please change tips
for every aspirate and dispense!***

***A1 of media block corresponds to A1 of plate and so on and so forth -
please make sure the plates and media blocks are the right way up before you
start the feed to ensure the right wells get the right media***
