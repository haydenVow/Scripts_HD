Eggs used

2x White Leghorn Chicken eggs after 24hrs incubation- Line to be called HORN1  
Note: Only 1 appear fertile upon opening and was used for isolation.  

2x White Leghorn Chicken eggs after 3 days incubation- Line to be called HORN3  
Note: Only 1 appear fertile upon opening and was used for isolation.  

3x Silkie Chicken eggs after 7 days incubation (33% of the approximate natural
incubation time till hatch)\- Line to be called SILKIE7  
Note: All 3 embryos combined.

6x Khaki Campbell duck eggs after 8 days incubation (29% of the approximate
natural incubation time till hatch) \- Line to be called KHAKI8  
Note: 5 of these embryos were combined, and 1 was discarded due to handling
error/ possible contamination.  

  




Process- Isolation of SILKIE and KHAKI embryonic cells.

Performed at our Melbourne lab space, Co-Labs, U/17 306 Albert St Brunswick
3056.

Note:  Eggs were processed one at a time, so that there was no delay between
cracking open the eggs, and euthanising the embryos.

  1. T75 flasks were pre-filled with 12mL of either DMEM/F12 + 10% KSR, DMEM/F12 + 10% FBS or OptiPRO+ 4mM Glutamax, and placed into the incubator prior to commencing the isolations. This was to warm and equilibrate the media in the CO2 environment. 1 flask was filled with each media, for each species.
  2. Mr Frosty placed in the fridge to cool. 
  3. Eggs removed from the egg incubator
  4. Eggs cleaned 2x with a Kim wipe soaked in F10, and then once more with 70% ethanol.
  5. Eggs transferred into the BSC
  6. Once air dried, each egg was cracked open, into a petri dish.
  7. Using sterile forceps, entire embryos were immediately removed from the rest of the egg, and transferred to fresh petri dishes.
  8. Embryos were quickly euthanised by removing their heads with sterile forceps    
  9. After all embryos had been collected, the bodies were transferred to collection jars containing 20mL of PBS + 2% pen/strep to rinse. All embryos from the same breed were combined into a single collection jar.
  10. Bodies transferred to a 2nd urine jar containing 20mL of PBS + 2% pen/strep for a 2nd wash. 
  11. Bodies were then pooled into a 50mL tubes (1 tube per species/breed) containing 20mL of PBS without antibiotics. 
  12. Each tube was mixed but pipetting with a 10mL or 25mL serological for 2-5 minutes, causing the embryos to fall apart into a semi-homogenous cell suspension.
  13. Cell suspension was then passed through a 70um cell filter and into a fresh 50mL tube. 
  14. Tubes were centrifuged for 5min at approximately 500xg.
  15. After centrifugation, supernatant was removed from each 50mL tube, and cell pellets were resuspended in 4mL of PBS without antibiotic-antimycotic. 
  16. For each cell line, 1mL of cell/PBS mix was seeded into 3 xT75 flasks, containing the media from step 1.
  17. All vessels were then transferred to the cell culture incubator, set to 37C and 5% CO2.
  18. The remaining 1mL of cell suspension for each species/breed was centrifuged for 5min at approximately 500xg. 
  19. Supernatant removed, and cell pellet resuspended in 1mL of Cryostor CS10 cryopreservation media, then transferred to a cryovial.
  20. Vial placed into the pre- cooled Mr. Frosty, and then into the -80C freezer (to be moved to N2 storage after 1-2 days). 




Process- Isolation of LEGHORN1 embryonic cells.  

Performed at our Melbourne lab space, Co-Labs, U/17 306 Albert St Brunswick
3056.

Note:  Eggs were processed one at a time, so that there was no delay between
cracking open the eggs, and euthanising the embryos.

  1. 3mL of OptiPRO + 4mM Glutamax media added to each well of a 6 well plate.
  2. 6-well plate containing media placed into the cell culture incubator in order to warm media and allow to equilibrate to CO2. 
  3. Eggs removed from the egg incubator
  4. Eggs cleaned 2x with a Kim wipe soaked in F10, and then once more with 70% ethanol.
  5. Eggs transferred to the BSC.
  6. Once ethanol evaporated, each egg was cracked open, into a petri dish.
  7. Embryonic disks located on the surface of the yolk (white spot in the case of D1 and streaks in the case of D3), and carefully removed using sterile forceps and scalpel. 
  8. Embryonic discs transferred to a single well of a 6 well plate (D1 egg in A1 and D3 egg in A2).
  9. Mixed with a 1mL pipette. 
  10. Vessel transferred to the cell culture incubator, set to 37C and 5% CO2.
