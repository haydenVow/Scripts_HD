Stained and imaged cells adhered to microcarriers

  1. Removed culture(s) 6603 from the incubator and placed them in the BSC  `| 15:06 am/pm|`
  2. Swirled culture(s) by hand on the flat surface of the BSC for 5 seconds, the lid was quickly removed and 3x 20uL samples of the suspension waere taken while the liquid was still in motion. This ensures the carriers were evenly mixed at time of sampling.
  3. Transferred the aliquot(s) to a well on a 96 well plate and mixed it with 80uL of dPBS.
  4. Returned cultures to the incubator  `| 16:00 am/pm|`
  5. Added Hoechst 33342 to 20uL/mL.
  6. Left the 96 well plate to incubate at room temperature, in the dark (away from light), for 12 minutes.  `| 16:50 - 17:00 |`
  7. After incubation the wells were inspected under the Axio microscope, 5x objective.
  8. Using https://mia-capture.vow.tools/#/, 3 sets of same frame images using the DAPI and PHASE channels were captured for each well `| : am/pm|`
    1. Manually set the exposure time for DAPI channel to the exposure time seen when carriers are viewed using the automatic exposure adjustment. (i.e if automatic exposure adjustment reads 0.002ms, set manual adjustment exposure time to be 0.002ms. 
    2. Fluorescence intensity of the UV lamp was adjusted until the centre of each microcarrier was barely visible compared to the space between microcarriers.
  9. Once images were captured, Image pairs were assigned a 'location ID' in MIA capture. 
  10. Images captured were then selected for analysis using the 'uCarrier cell count plastic' tool from MIA capture.

Observations/Summary:

  * Discarded the cell pellet after harvest as there was not enough cells to passage into a new E flask. 
  * Results from the passage of planar cells (see lab book entry prior) indicated that the cells were adhered strongly to their surfaces, it is possible this contributed to lower cell output than cell input. 




SOPs used:

### N/A




### Results:

  * Results were;
    * [ ]  As Usual (this is a repetitive task)
    * [X]  Unexpected because...fewer cells were recovered than were seeded despite microcarriers appearing clear of recalcitrant cells
    * [ ]  Need to be further analysed
    * [ ]  Other (.......)
