## Prepare basal

7 feeds * 21 flasks * 15 mL = 2205 mL

1 seed * 21 flasks * 20 mL = 420 mL

Total per experiment = 2625 mL

Total for 2 experiments = 5250 mL + excess = 5,500 mL

  1. Reconstituted HyCell CHO powdered medium according to product instructions 
    1. Osmolaltiy: 9.96
    2. pH: 6.7
  2. Added 1 molar NaOH drop-wise to increase pH. Final pH: 7.4
  3. Prepared basal medium for EPICS 28842 & 28843 without KSR

For basal medium without Poloxamer and with Glutamax

## Notes/Observations

Required a lot of NaOH to adjust pH to 7-7.4. Initally was at 6.7, so added 1M
NaOH dropwise. This was far too slow, so had to pour the 1M NaOH in and also
add NaOH pellets directly to mix. Added 78 mL total to the mix.
