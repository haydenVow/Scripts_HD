Prepare materials for thaw and seed:

Aliquotted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then
placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath for a minimum of 20 minutes
prior to use:

  *  Growth media (for counts, resuspension, and seeding):    63.5 mL 
  * Time that aliquot was placed in the water bath to warm before use:   13:13 

  




## Thaw and seed vial:

3\. Collected the cryovial from Liquid Nitrogen storage & place in foam
floater in water bath for 5 min  14:07 - 14:12

Location where cryovial was collected from:

Vial details:  1  cryovials at   5 M  cells

Brew

Tower/Bucket # 4

Box/Cane # 5  

Vial location: C1

Vial ID(s): 3085-Culture-7346-Vial-1of38

`4. Ethanol sprayed & transferred the vial(s) to the BSC.`

`5.  Added  500 µL of Growth Media (to generate a total volume of 1mL in the
cryovial) to the cryovial, resuspended the cell suspension gently to reduce
osmotic shock. Took aside 10uL of the cell suspension for a cell count.  
`

`6. Collected the entire 1mL of cell suspension & transfer into the pre-warmed
tube of ~29 mL of Growth Media. ```

`Perform a cell count. Total number of cells was: 3 492 000 cells```  

`Prepare two cell suspensions:`

2328000` cells in 41.400 mL of growth media -> Use this to seed 1x whole 96
well plate, and 1x 96 well plate without edge wells (230uL/well). Add
200uL/well PBS to the edge wells.  
`

`1164000 cells in 16.5 mL of growth media -> Use this to seed 1x 24 well plate
with 550 uL/well`

`9. Transferred flask/plate(s) to incubate at: (time not recorded - approx
15:00)  
`

  * [X]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (aviary cells)

  

Making labels

Note - You will need to increase the passage number by one. (i.e. if your
thawed vial ID has a passage number of 3, when you make a culture ID for you
vessel you will need change the passage number to 4 on Airtable.)

Summary:

Thawed a vial of F_DOLLY12 WCB containing 4 M cells. Used this to seed 2x 96
wp and 1x24 wp.
