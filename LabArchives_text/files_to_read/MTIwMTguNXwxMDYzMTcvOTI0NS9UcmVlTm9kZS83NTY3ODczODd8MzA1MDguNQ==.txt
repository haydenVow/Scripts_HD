Process:

Aliquoted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then
placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath > 30 minutes prior to use

  1. Observed cultures under the microscope and recorded confluence in the table above. 
  2. Imaged cultures on 10x magnification (captured in Mia)
  3. TrypLE:   800mL  
  4. dPBS (for washing & neutralising)   1.5L
  5. Growth media (for pellet resuspension and seeding):   250mL  
  6. Washed the flask(s) with dPBS.
  7. Added  tryple to each vessel (volumes as per the table at the top of the page) and incubated at 37˚C for   10min  
  8. Neutralised withdPBS (warmed) (volumes as per the table at the top of the page)  and combined cell suspension into a   200mL   tubes.
  9. Centrifuged at 650 x g for 5 min.
  10. Aspirated+ discarded supernatant
  11. Resuspended pellet(s) in complete Nuvonis suspension media + 10ng/mL FGF2.  
Performed a cell count using the hemocytometer and recorded the cell count
data in widget or the Google Doc spreadsheet called 'Cell Count Spreadsheet'
(see link below):

  12. Total cell number was:  
KINGO: 55.5M  
MUSCO: 83.2M  
KHAKIO:262.26M  
  

  13. 1-2M cells were taken from each culture for use in a colometric assay as well as the Cellec

  14. KHAKIO and MUSCO cells were also taken for cryopreservation. 60M KHAKIO and 24M MUSCO cells were transferred to fresh 50mL falcon tubes and centrifuged for 5min at 650g. Supernatant was remove and pellets were resuspended in CryostorCS10 at either 4 (MUSCO) or 5 (KHAKIO) million cells/mL. After aliquoting into cryovials, vials were placed into Mr Frostys and put in the -80C freezer in library lab.

  15. Re-seeded remaining cells as per table above.

  16. Transferred flasks to incubate at 37ºC, 5% CO2, library lab incubator #77, shaking speed 195RPM
