Aim/Purpose


AIM/PURPOSE: To use CRISPR-Cas9 gene targeting in CHOMP cells to induce double
stranded breaks into genes of interest potentially involved in suspension
adaptation to reduce/eliminate their expression.


Technical Gap


Previous suspension adaptation experiments have been unsuccessful at adapting
CHOMP fibroblast cells to suspension. We hypothesise that this is because the
cells are not altering gene expression of key genes that are required for
successful suspension adaptation. through the use of gene editing we hope to
be able to alter gene expression of key genes in order to increase the
likelihood of CHOMP cells adapting to suspension.


Hypothesis


HYPOTHESIS: The knockdown of genes of interest will improve the ability of
CHOMP cells to adapt to suspension
