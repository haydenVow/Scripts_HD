Process:

1\. Aliquotted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then
placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath for a minimum of 20 minutes
prior to use:

  1. TrypLE:      20 mL in     1  tube
  2. dPBS (for washing and neutralising)   40    mL in     1   tube
  3. Growth media (for pellet resuspension + Seeding):   600    mL in   2    bottle
  4. Times that all aliquots were placed in the water bath to warm before use    12:45 

Note: if aliquots were placed in water bath at different times, record the
time stamp for each individual solution.




2\. Washed the flask(s) with dPBS.

3\. Added   10    mL tryple to each vessel/well and incubated at 37˚C for
10   min. 13:10  

4\. Neutralised with     10mL  dPBS (warmed) and combined cell suspension into
a   50mL   tube.

5\. Centrifuged at 650 x g for 5 min

  1. Start time for centrifugation was   13:22    




6\. Aspirated the supernatant(s)

7\. Resuspended pellet(s) in      10  mL   growht media.

8\. Performed a cell count using the haemocytometer and recorded the cell
count data in widget or the Google Doc spreadsheet called 'Cell Count
Spreadsheet' (see link below):

9\. Total cell number was:  16,150,000

11\. Volume of cell suspension required for subculture was:   600mL=14CF =
6400 cells/cm  

12\. Transfer entire suspension to the pre-warmed  590 mL Growth Media.

13\. Transfer cell suspension into (non-gelatin coated)    1 x 4CF
flasks/plates.

14\. Transfer flask/plate(s) to incubate at: 13:55

  * [ ]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * [x]  30ºC, 5% CO2 (reptile  cells)
