Overview  
  
Thaw:

4 x Nuvonis fibroblasts (7.5M cells per vial)

2 x CHOMP fibroblast (15M cells per vial)  
  
Seed 3x2CF with 9.9M per flask  (7850 cells/cm2) per cell line. 2CF= 1264cm2.  
  
Place the seeded flasks directly into the 30'C incubator (do not leave them in
the BSC for 30 minutes). Fibroblasts do not need gelatin coated flasks and do
not need p38i.

Process:

1\. Aliquotted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then
placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath for a minimum of 20 minutes
prior to use:

  1.  Growth media (for seeding):    mL in    tubes 
  2.  Time that all aliquot was placed in the water bath to warm before use:   : a/pm 

2\. Collected the cryovial from Liquid Nitrogen storage & place in foam
floater in water bath for 5 min  : - : a/pm

Location where cryovial was collected from:

 Homer  OR Dewer 1

Tower/Bucket #

Box/Cane #

3\. Ethanol sprayed & transferred the vial(s) to the BSC.

4\. Added  µL of Growth Media (to generate a total volume of 1mL in the
cryovial) to the cryovial, resuspended the cell suspension gently to reduce
osmotic shock.

5\. Collected the entire 1mL of cell suspension & transfer into the pre-warmed
tube of Growth Media (prepared in Step 2).




6\. Using a 10mL serological pipette, resuspended & distributed the cells
evenly in the   mL of pre-warmed Growth Media (prepared in Step 2).

7\. Seeded cells into (non-gelatin coated) flasks/wells at approximately 7k
cells per cm2.

  1. e.g. 1 million fibroblasts can be seeded into 1 x T175

8\. Transfered   mL to each    flask/well.

9\. Transfered flask/plate(s) to incubate at:

  * [ ]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (aviary cells)




SOPs used:
