D1 MuSC Prolif samples- Fix, MyoD, TE7, DAPI stain and Image 1 sample from
each condition. Note down whether there is a good cell coverage across the
material/scaffold surface.

Process:

1\. Removed plate culture IDs: 6496-DOLLY12-Sheep P11-1of1  containing
scaffolds from the incubator.

2\. Used sterile tweezers to carefully transfer   5x (highlighted in bold in
the image above)   scaffold pieces to separate wells on a 24 well plate.

3\. Washed the pieces in the 24 well plate 3x in   2  mL of PBS for  5
minutes at room temperature.

  1.  10:48 - 10:53   

  2.  10:54 - 10:59   

  3.  11:00 - 11:05   

  




4\. Added 1500 uL of 4% PFA to each scaffold and incubate for  15  min at room
temperature.  11:07 - 11:22  




5. Wash the pieces 3 times for   5    minutes in   2  mL of PBS.

  1.  11:24 - 11:29   

  2.  11:30 - 11:35   

  3.  11:36 - 11:41   

  

6\. Aspirate the PBS and leave the scaffold pieces just covered by fresh PBS.

7\. Proceed with primary and secondary antibody staining.




### Observations/Summary:

-Leave scaffolds in the 24-well inserts to make the process of washing and fixing extremly easy. Not necessary to aspirate PBS each time.

Primary Antibody Staining

  

Reagent preparation:

Use the following spreadsheet to:

  * Determine the total amount of regent required for primary staining
  * Provide more information on antibody types

1\. Prepared  7.5 mL  PBST (0.2% Triton-X)

2\. Prepared 7.5 mL  blocking buffer: PBST (0.1% Triton-X + PBS) + 3% bovine
serum albumin (BSA). (Kept in the fridge until needed in blocking step)

3\. Prepared Primary Antibody Mix:  25 µL   Primary #1 MyoD (Santa Cruz)
(1:200  ) +   50µL   Primary #2 TE-7   (1:100  ) +  4925µL Blocking Buffer  
  
Total volume required = 5000 ul

Vortexed antibody mix for 5 seconds and stored refrigerated away from light
until needed.

IgG2bAF555 tagged to anti-mouse IgG2b antibody1:200  
  
  




Process:

Permeabilise

1\. Removed PBS from each well.

2\. Added  1500 µL PBST (0.2% Triton-X) to each well for 15 min:  11:45 -
12:00

3\. Aspirated PBST for each well.




Blocking

1\. Added  1500 µL of blocking buffer per well (3% BSA in PBST [0.1%
Triton-X]) and incubate for 45 minutes - 1hr at RT. (no more than 1 hour):
12:01 - 12:51




Simultaneous Primary Antibody staining

1\. Removed blocking buffer from each well.

2\. Incubated cells with primary antibody for 90min - 2hrs at RT: 13:03 -
14:40

After this step, all further task should be performed in a dark room. The
vessel should also be wrapped foil when not used.

Observations/Summary:

Zein scaffolds seeded with fibroblasts and MuSC in the prescence of Vit C or
no Vit C were stained with both primary antibodies for ~1 hr 30 mins.
