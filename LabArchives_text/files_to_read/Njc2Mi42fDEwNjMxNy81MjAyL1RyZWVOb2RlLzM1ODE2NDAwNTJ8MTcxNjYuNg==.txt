For a 12wp, double all the values used for a 24wp




Media/Reagents used:

NameDetails  
Hoechst-33342  
S3811  
  
PFA  
21 (11 mL + 10 mL) mL; A3088  
  
dPBS130 mL (128 mL + excess); M8113  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
16 wells in total

1 mL of PFA in each well = 16 mL

2 mL of dPBS x 4 (once to wash out growth media, twice to wash out the PFA and
once again to top up the fixed cells) x 16 (number of wells) = 128 mL

  




Bradford:

  1. Added 8 drops of Hoechst 33342 to 8mL of Milli-Q water in a 15mL black centrifuge tube
  2. Removed media supernatant from Row 3 of Plate #8822 and Row 1 of Plate #8823.
  3. Added 1mL of Hoechst/Milli-Q water mix and incubated at 37 degrees for 15 mins [ 15:47 - 16:02  a/pm]
  4. Imaged relevant rows on Zaber for cell normalisation.
  5. Scraped cells using spatula and transferred each well to a separate 1.5mL eppendorf tube.
  6. Performed freeze-thaw lysis protocol on each Eppendorf tube [ 17:38 - 17:46 a/pm, 17:49 - 17:59 a/pm, 18:00 - 18:11 a/pm]
  7. Centrifuged tubes for 5 mins at 1000g using micro-centrifuge.
  8. Test supernatant volume against 250uL of Bradford reagent until a ratio that yields an amber colour is achieved.
    1. sample volume used for Bradford: 10 uL
    2. total sample volume: 500 uL
  9. Construct a standard curve with BSA solution (2mg/mL) using the determined ratio from the previous step.
  10.   




Process:

Fixing carried out using the Opentron

Parafilm the assay plate and place in fridge.

  

  




Observations/Summary:

### Fixed both Estim plates (05/11) - can proceed to primary stain.

Had to add PFA manually due to operator error.
