Procedure

Starting a Seed Train - Day 2

  1. Prepare a water bath heated to 37°C.
  2. Transfer a 500 mL Erlenmeyer flask with vented caps into a BSC.
  3. Aliquot the required volume of complete RPMI 1640:CHOin1 (50:50) suspension growth medium.
    1. Seed the cells at a minimum of 250kcells/mL
  4. Transfer the media aliquot into the pre-warmed water bath at 37°C for at least 20 minutes.
  5. Transfer the ULA plates and the warmed media into the BSC.
  6. Transfer the cell suspension from the ULA plates into an empty sterile vessel. Gently resuspend the cells in each well before transferring them to ensure the majority of cells are collected.
  7. Homogenise the cell suspension using a serological pipette and gently aspirate and dispense the cell suspension several times.
  8. Retrieve 2x 50 μl samples.
  9. Perform a cell count and calculate the required volume of media to add to keep the cells around a seeding density of 250kcells/mL and add this media to the cell suspension
    1. Record cell count in MFG "New cell count calculator" spreadsheet --> https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1sDqHQ7x2J-_lqIVKhfBqnXJRjsNZAR724wiLtSYLI8g/edit#gid=235487472
  10. Transfer the resuspended cells into the 500 mL Erlenmeyer flask.
  11. Transfer the 500 mL Erlenmeyer flask to an incubator (37°C, 5% CO2, 95% relative humidity) and set agitation speed of shaking platform to 120 rotations per minute (RPM).
  12. Continue incubation at 37°C, 5% CO2 until the cells require a passage (800,000 - 1,000,000 cells/mL).
