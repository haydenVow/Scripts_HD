Process:

  1.  Three solutions of Gelatin were prepared at a concentration of 20 mg/mL by adding 2000 mg of gelatin powder in 3 x 200mL Schott bottles first.
  2. 100mL of E6, Growth Media and Milli-Q water were added to one of each gelatin containing Schott bottle.
  3. Each solution was mixed by swirling by hand then placed on hotplate at 60 degrees for 10 minutes until Gelatin powder fully dissolved in respective solvent.
  4. Each solution was transferred to BSC (wiped with Ethanol soaked rediwipe) and sterile filtered under vacum (0.1uM filter) and transferred into respective 120mL sample containers. Solution must be transferred and filtered while hot in order to prevent gelatin from setting while filtering.
  5. 25mL of 20mg/mL solutions were transferred to tubes marked 10 mg/mL and topped up with 25mL of fresh E6/GM/Gelatin to make the total concentration 10 mg/mL.
  6. 25mL of 10mg/mL solutions were transferred to tubes marked 5 mg/mL and topped up with 25mL of fresh E6/GM/Gelatin to make the total concentration 5 mg/mL.
  7. 10mL of 5mg/mL solutions were transferred to tubes marked 1 mg/mL and topped up with 40mL of fresh E6/GM/Gelatin to make the total concentration 1 mg/mL.
  8. 10 x 96 well plates were transferred into BSC and the respective plates to be coated were coated with 100uL of the respective concentration (5 plates were coated (4 x Prolif + 1 x Maturation), 4 were not)
