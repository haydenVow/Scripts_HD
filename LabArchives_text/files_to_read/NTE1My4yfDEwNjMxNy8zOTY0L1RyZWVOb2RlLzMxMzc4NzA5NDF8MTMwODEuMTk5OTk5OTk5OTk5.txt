Perform feed using below volumes:

  






Growth Media:

  * [x]  DMEM/F12 + 10% FBS + 1X P/S




### Process:  

3\. Aliquoted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then
placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath for a minimum of 20 minutes
prior to use:

  1. TrypLE:    10    mL in     1 x 15mL Falcon Tube  tub
  2.  dPBS (for washing and neutralising):    10mL    mL 
  3. dPBS (for neutralising):    10mL    mL
  4. Growth media (for pellet resuspension):   5   mL 
  5. Growth media (for seeding):   90mL.

Time that all aliquots were placed in the water bath the warm before use
13:10  

Note: if aliquots were placed in water bath at different time, record the time
stamp for each individual solution.




4\. Removed vessel(s) from the incubator

5\. Washed the vessel(s) with dPBS (warmed).

6\. Added    10   mL tryple to each vessel/well and incubated at 37ËšC.

  1. Start/Finish for TrypLE was   13:40-13:50  

7\. Neutralised with    10 mL   dPBS and combined cell suspension.

8\. Centrifuged at 650 x g for 5 min.

  1. Start/Finish time for centrifugation was   13:55-14:00

9\. Aspirated the supernatant(s).

10\. Resuspended pellet(s) in    5   mL       growth   media

11\. Aliquoted    20     of resuspended cells into a microcentrifuge tube for
cell count.

12\. Performed a cell count using the haemocytometer and recorded the cell
count data in the Google Doc spreadsheet called 'Cell Count Spreadsheet' (see
link below):

  1. Total cell number was:    2,880,000  \- Took 42k For Bec mutagenesis experiment, = 2,838,000 cells to seed   

  2. Cell density per vessel:   6,677     
2,838,000/7000=405.5cm Seeded into 2xT175 +1x T75

Note: 42K cells were given to Bec for mutagenesis experiment

13\. Added cell suspension into 72mL of growth media.

14\. Seeded 2x T175 by adding 30 mL of resuspended cells in media into each
T175 and  12 mL of resuspended cells into T75

15\. Placed in incubator at 14:25 (Library - top binder)
