Aim/Purpose


To formulate an ACF media formulation for the optimal differentiation of
myoblasts, using a combination of small molecule inhibitors, growth factors
and media supplements


Methods/Procedures


We will use multiple different approaches to optimise the differentiation of
myoblasts into mature muscle:

  * Definitive Screening Design (DSD) to determine combinations of compounds, growth factors and supplements that work best together to enhance myogenesis
  * Phased differentiation approach, whereby the differentiation media components change over time, to better mimic the developmental phases that Muscle stem cells and myoblasts undergo to produce muscle
