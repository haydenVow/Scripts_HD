Growth Media:

  * [x]  DMEM/F12 + 20% FBS + 1X P/S + P38i (10uM) + 1%w/v poloxomer 188 solution. 

Total media required: 155mL

Total p38i required: 77.5uL

  




Equilibrate microcarriers in culture medium before use

  1. Prior to use, aliquotted | 34.875 | mL of sterilized microcarriers ( 20 g/L stock) suspended in dPBS into |  1 |  x |  250mL | container.
  2. Rinsed microcarriers in | 35 | mL culture medium (50 mL/g Cytodex). (this rinse reduces dilution of the culture medium by PBS trapped between and within the microcarriers, which is particularly important when using small culture volumes or cells with low plating efficiencies).
  3. The microcarriers were then allowed to settle and as much supernatant as possible was removed.
  4. The microcarriers were resuspended to the desired volume of culture medium ( | 155 | mL ). (15.5 mL of 10% w/v poloxamer 188 solution, then topped up to 155 using growth media DMEM/F12 + 20% FBS + 1xP/S, 77.5uL of p38i was then added to this mix.
  5. The suspension was split across 9 vessels. 
    1. 3xE125 flasks (30mL each)
    2. 6x 50mL bioreactor tubes (10mL each)
  6. The culture vessel was transferred to the incubator ion the main lab for at least 1 hour so that the microcarriers and culture medium could equilibrate. |   15:00   am/pm | 
    * 37 degrees, 5% CO2, Incubator #  | ? Top sanyo in the main lab  |
