Process

Prior to day - Half the cells from a confluent T75 flask were collected, spun
down, washed with PBS and frozen at -80 degrees c. These frozen pellets were
used for RNA extraction.

  

Day of RNA extraction

Samples were taken to UNSW and placed into a fume cupboard:

  1. Centrifuge was cooled to 4˚C
  2. 1 mL tri reagent was added to each cell pellet
  3. Sample sat at room temp for at least 2 mins
  4. 200μl chloroform was added to each tube per 1mL tri-reagent
  5. Samples were shaken vigorously for 15 seconds
  6. Samples sat at room temp for 2-3 mins 
  7. Samples were Centrifuged at 4˚c at 12000 g for 10 mins
  8. While spinning, obtain new 1.5 ml tubes were obtained from the RNeasy kit and add 450μl of 70% RNA only ethanol was added to each
  9. The centrifuged samples were placed on ice
  10. The aqueous phase of the samples was transferred into new 1.5 mL tubes with ethanol. (approx. 450μl per tube)
  11. 500μl of solution (sample + ethanol) was added to a spin column from the RNeasy kit for each sample
  12. Samples were centrifuged at 10000 g for 30 seconds
  13. Flowthrough was discarded
  14. The remaining solution from each sample (sample + ethanol) was added to the spin column
  15. The samples were centrifuged again at 10000 g for 30 seconds
  16. Flowthrough was discarded 
  17. 350μl RW1 was to each spin column and spun again 10000 g for 30 seconds
  18. Flowthrough was discarded  

OUT OF FUME CUPBOARD

  1. DNase MM was made up by first reconsituting the DNase. This was done according to manufacturers instructions
  2. A 10 x MM was prepared  (1x = 70μl Buffer + 10μl DNase)
  3. 80μl DNase MM was added directly to the membrane of each spin column 
  4. The DNase was allowed to sit at RT for 15 mins
  5. 350μl RW1 was added to each column, centrifuged at 10000 g for 30 seconds and flowthrough discarded
  6. 500 ul of buffer RPE was added to each spin column, centrifuged at 10 000 x g for 30 seconds, and flowthrough discarded
  7. 500 ul of buffer RPE was added to each spin column, centrifuged at 10 000 x g for 2 minutes and flowthrough discarded
  8. The columns were transferred to new collection tubes and centrifuged at 16 400 x g (max speed) for 1 minute
  9. The lids of the column were opened and allowed to sit at room temperature for 2-3 mins
  10. The columns were transferred to new 1.5 mL tubes from the RNeasy kit 
  11. 40 ul of RNase free water was added to the membrane of each column which sat at RT for 2-3 minutes
  12. The samples were centrifuged at 10000 g for 1 minute to elute the samples
  13. Samples were placed on ice
  14. Samples were nanodropped, while keeping them on ice
  15. Samples were placed in the -80 freezer in box F3-1

  




Sample from the AQP1 adherent culture was lost due to a tube popping open. It
was not able to be further processed
