  1. As a result of bacterial contamination, lost flasks 12292 and 12293. Re-seeded these flasks from a 90/10 RPMI/Hycell cell suspension provided by Lily (*See lab book entry in Observations below).

  2. Aliquotted 40 mL of 90/10 RPMI/CHO Part A + Nuvonis, and added 40uL of IGF and  8uL of EGF to it.

  3. Aliquoted the following mL of cell suspension into 2 x 50 mL tubes:  
  

Condition

Volume of cell suspension used to re-seed flask @ 100k cells/mL (mL)  
  
  
12257, 12232, 12239

5.109  
  
  

  4. Centrifuged the tubes @ 500 xg for 5 minutes.  
  

  5. After centrifugation, aspirated the supernatant and resuspended cell pellet in 20 mL of medium. Then re-seeded flasks with the calculated volume of cell suspension.  
  

  6. Replaced E125 in incubator at 37'C, 5% CO2, 120 RPM
