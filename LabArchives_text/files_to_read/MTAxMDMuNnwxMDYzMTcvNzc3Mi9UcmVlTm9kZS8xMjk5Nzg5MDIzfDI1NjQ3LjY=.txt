Note- LIBRARY LAB  
  
There should be Nuvonis base media (freestyle with all the additives except
growth factors in library lab fridge 126. I have not made an aliquot because I
was not expecting them to need to be passaged sorry!

Growth factors are all in the -20 freezer in library lab, except for the FGF2
(FBF basic) which you will need to steal from main lab.

Process:  

  1. Aliquot 51mL Nuvonis suspension media (fridge 126 in library lab) into a urine jar
  2. In the BSC, add 5ul EGF, 100ul FGF2 and 51ul IGF1-LR3 to the urine jar. 
  3. Place in the water bath and warm to 37C 
  4. Collect vessels from shaker, and brought into BSC 
  5. Split culture 11477 into four new shaker tubes (2.5mL of cell suspension per tube)
  6. Add 7.5mL pre-warmed culture media to each of the tubes. 
  7. To the remaining media in the urine jar, add 2ul YIGSR + 1.05ul RGD (aliquots in 2nd draw of -20 freezer)
  8. Split culture 11480 into 3x new 50mL shaker tubes (3.3mL per tube)
  9. Add 6.7mL of media from the urine jar to each of the above. 
  10. Return all tubes to incubator on shaking platform, which should be pre-set to 200RPM
