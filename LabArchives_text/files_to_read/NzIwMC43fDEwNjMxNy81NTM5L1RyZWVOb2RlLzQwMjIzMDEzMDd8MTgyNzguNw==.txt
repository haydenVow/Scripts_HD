Reagent preperation

1\. Aliquotted  300 mL   of  Growth Media. Placed in water bath   10:56 am




Cell factory Process

  1. Unscrew white cap and remove blue cap and place aside.
  2. Removed   50%   of supernatant Cell Factory by carefully pouring into a waste container with volume marking.
  3. Replaced with  300 mL   (per flask) of growth media by carefully pouring media through the white cap opening 
  4. Place caps back and equalise 4CF by placing it on its side (blue cap on the bottom and white cap on the top, see image below:)  
  

4\. Returned vessel to incubate at: 14:42

  * [x]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (aviary cells)

  

  * [ ]  Thermo Incubator (ID #13)
  * [X]  Top Sanyo Incubator (ID #118)
  * [ ]  Bottom Sanyo Incubator
  * [ ]  Top Binder Incubator
  * [ ]  Bottom Binder Incubator




### Observations/Summary:

 50 % media changed on vessel(s)

  1. 

p38i added to GM and left in WB for ~4 hours

4CF was approximately 40-50% confluent with some marked confluent patches (Bec
and Marie were consulted)
