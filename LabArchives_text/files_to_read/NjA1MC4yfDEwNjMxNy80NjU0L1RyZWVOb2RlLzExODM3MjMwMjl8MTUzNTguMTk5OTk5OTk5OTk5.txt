Process

Cultures observed under the microscope and images were taken at 10
magnification where adherent cells were observed.

  




Observations  
After yesterdays passage, 8532- appears far more confluent that 8533-WALLE04.
There is also a lot of dead/floating cells in the passaged 8533-WALLE04
culture compared to 8532-WALLE02. As was seen on 13/10/21, some scattered
cells were seen in the wells originally containing spent medium in cultures
8241-WALLE02 and 8243-WALLE04 however there are still very few of these.

No adhered cells were observed in WALLE03 or WALLE05 cultures.
