Please include method of sterilization. Once sterilised store scaffolds for no
more than 1 week prior to seeding, either dry or in a tissue culture dish
equilibrated in media (just plain DMEM/F12 or the media that will be used for
seeding). See below for sterilisation methods:  




Condition one: Heat in water at 80 degrees + autoclave

  1. Cut into desirable size for use as scaffold in cell culture 
  2. Place samples into a beaker and seal with aluminium 

Condition two: Autoclave

  1.  ~~Cut into desirable size for use as scaffold in cell culture~~ ~~   ~~Sample was sticky and could not form the right size scaffold. Therefore placed small chunks into the beakers to be cut into size after autoclaving. 
  2. Place samples into a beaker and seal with aluminium 

  

Condition Three: Dry heat

  1. Cut into desirable size for use as scaffold in cell culture
  2.  Place sample in suitable bag for heat sterilisation 
  3.  Treat samples at 220 degrees dry heat 
  4.  Allow samples to cool before use




Observations

After gluten samples were prepared, they were placed in a acetone washed and
heated glass dish. Upon exposure to 120 degree heat in the dry heat oven, the
gluten sample expanded and subsequently grew out of the vessel by lifting the
glass lid off. As the dishes were opened by the expanded gluten, the material
was exposed to the air and could no longer be considered sterile. For this
reason, the samples were discarded and dry heat excluded as a condition for
this experiment. To replace this, and alternative conditions, heat treatment
(with water at 80 degrees for 120 minutes) + autoclave + EPL coated, was
prepared using the remaining gluten prepared earlier.
