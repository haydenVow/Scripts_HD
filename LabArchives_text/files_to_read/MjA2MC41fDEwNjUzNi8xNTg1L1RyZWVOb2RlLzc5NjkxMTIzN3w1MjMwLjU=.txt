To do this: select the middle pH reading and check whether it's taking reading
from Probe 1 or 2. Select "Cali" tab for online reading probe (in this case
Probe 1) and change the offset value to (offline ph reading - online ph
reading) - in this case +0.1 offset. The select 'cali' tab for other probe and
change the offset value to (offline pH reading - online probe ph reading).
Doing the latter will ensure the offset has been changed already if online
reading is switched to alternative probe.
