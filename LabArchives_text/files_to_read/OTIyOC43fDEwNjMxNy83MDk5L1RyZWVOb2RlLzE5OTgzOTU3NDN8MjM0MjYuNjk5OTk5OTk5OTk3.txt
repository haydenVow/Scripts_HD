Took samples

  1. Sprayed down the sample line end with 70% ethanol.
  2. Connected a 5 mL sterile syringe.
  3. Withdrew 1 mL (first-draw)
  4. Disconnected sample syringe and transferred 1 mL of sample each to 1.5 mL Eppendorf tubes for cell count
  5. Connected a fresh sterile syringe and withdrew 1 mL of sample (second-draw).
  6. Disconnected sample syringe and transferred 1 mL of sample each to 1.5 mL Eppendorf tubes for cell count
  7. Sprayed sample line with 70% ethanol.
  8. Performed cell count:
    * 1st draw: 820K
    * 2nd draw: 900K
    * 3rd draw: 1.136M
    * average: 952K cells/mL (2 284 800 000 total)

### Observations/Summary:

  * Navigated to https://192.168.0.250/ from a web browser window
  * Logged into the Biostat web app using the details in the operating manual (see reference).
    1. Username: "admin" (all lower case)
    2. Password: "709aA0"

  

  * stirring speed: 70
  * pH: 7.56
  * dissolved oxygen: -1.9%
  * temperature: 37

Performed draw and fill:

  * removed 2L by pumping out into 2L bottle connected (originally for media in)
  * this was used as seed train for EPIC 31048
  * freshly prepared media (2L) was then pumped back into the system using SUBS-A
  * calculated cell count following: 
    * 1.136M/mL before draw (2L removed from 2.4L)
    * (1.136x2400) - (1.136x2000) = total remaining cells
    * ~190 000 cells/mL following media replacement
