crocodile cells)  

2\. Check under microscope to check for contamination or attached cells.
Please image cells on 10x magnification if you see any adhered to the plate.  

3\. Remove 1.5mL media from each well, without removing tissue chunks.

4\. Gently topped up media by slowly adding 1.5mL GM to side of well, taking
care not to dislodge chunks from the bottom of the plate.

4\. returned to incubator at 28C with no CO2 at 14:25  

  




Observations/Summary:

nothing obvious in terms of contamination, nothing moving but lots of debris
flaoting around. No adherent cells anywhere
