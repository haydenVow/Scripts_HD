Electrical stimulation has been found to increase myogenic maturation, myotube
formation and alignment. This is demonstrated in literature through enhanced
myosin heavy chain expression and increased myogenic markers MyoD and desmin.
Most stimulating setups use charge balanced square biphasic waveforms or a
salt bridge to prevent pH changes to the media. Different burst and frequency
patterns have been shown to produce different outcomes, such as different
myosin isoforms. Voltages used are commonly in the range of 2-100 mV/cm or
2-10 V/cm, where the units V/cm refers to the total voltage used over the
distance between the positive and negative electrodes. Studies which have
shown alignment have used voltages in the rage of 2 - 10 V/cm. Stimulation is
typically started at or after the cells have been changed from growth to
differentiation media. It is hypothesised that electrical stimulation induces
myotube formation by promoting cell growth in a PI3K-dependent manner.
