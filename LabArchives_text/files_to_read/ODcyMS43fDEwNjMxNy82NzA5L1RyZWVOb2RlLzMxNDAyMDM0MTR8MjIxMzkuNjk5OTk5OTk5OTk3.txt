Operator: Shaleen/Adem/Alex

Kitchen/yurt lab:

  1. Sacrificed lobster 10:59am 
  2. Collect sacrificed lobster and submerge in 10% Sodium Hypochlorite for 10 mins. 11:01 - 11:11
  3. Cut tail from lobster 11:11 - 11:14
  4. Spray lobster with EtOH three times and leave for five minutes at a time.
    1. 11:15 - 11:20
    2. 11:20 - 11:25
    3. 11:25 - 11:30 
  5. cut the inner section of the lobster tail to remove the shell 11:32
  6. Submerge lobster in a shallow bath of ALS + 1X P/S. 
  7. Dissect three 3-5g muscle tissues in this bath and wash thrice in ALS + 1X P/S (6 tubes needed) for 5 mins.

In BSC:

  1. Pipette 10ml of basal media into 2 x  100mm petri dishes.
  2. Place both samples into each petri dish and mince samples into 0.1mm - 5mm sections.

  


  
  
Figure 3: Conditions for outgrowth/enzymatic digestion isolation  
  
  




1\. Gelatin coated 4 x 6 well plates.

Outgrowth protocol:

  1. Transfer minced tissue from one petri dish onto sterile gauze briefly to dry the tissue from basal media.
  2. Split minced tissue into each condition well as outlined in Figure 3 above.

Place the dishes containing L-15 media into the incubator set to 0% CO2 and
the remaining petri dishes into an incubator set to 20째C.

Enzymatic digestion protocol:

  1. Transfer the minced tissue from the other petri dish to a 50ml falcon tube containing 50ml DMEM/F12 + Collagenase/Dispase (50:50).
  2. Incubate for 1 hour, 20째C with optional agitation in the water bath. 12:22 - 13:56
  3. Pass cell suspension through a 70uM cell strainer and split suspension into 1 x 50ml falcon tubes 
  4. Centrifuge tubes at 500g for 5 min.    14:07 pm   

  5. Wash the cell pellets once with 30mL Wash Media (DMEM/F12+ 1XP/S)
    1. Centrifuge at 1000 x g for 5 min in between washes. 14:18 pm  
*The supernatant should appear clear after the last wash.
      1. Note: a cell pellet was observed from 500g this time 
      2. Note:
  6. Aspirate supernatant from pellet.
  7. Resuspend pellet with 2ml of each respective media type.
  8. Take small aliquots of each cell suspension and observe under haemocytometer to gauge cell density.
  9. Transfer    200  uL of each cell suspension into 3mL of each room temperature growth media . Mix well.
  10. Seed each cell suspension as per Figure 3 above, and place in incubator at 20째C, 5% CO2 (except for L-15 media dishes). (parafilmed around the edges)    pm
