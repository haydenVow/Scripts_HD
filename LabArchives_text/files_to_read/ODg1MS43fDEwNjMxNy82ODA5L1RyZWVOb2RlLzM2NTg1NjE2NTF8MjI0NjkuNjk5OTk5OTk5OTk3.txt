  1. Prepare 150 mL of Hycell media in each water treatment (MilliQ, bottled ultrapure and reverse osmosis)
    1. Add 25.4 g/L of Hycell CHO powder, 2.2 g/L of sodium bicarbonate and 1 g/L of poloxamer 188
    2. Stir until dissolved
    3. Sterile filter through a 0.22 um filter unit
    4. Determine electrical conductivity and pH of each sample
