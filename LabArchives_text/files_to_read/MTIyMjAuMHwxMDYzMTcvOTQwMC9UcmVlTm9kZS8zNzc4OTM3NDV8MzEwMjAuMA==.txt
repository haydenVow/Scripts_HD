Passaged the 20% serum adapted CHOMP cells into new vessels today. Cells were
70% confluent upon passaging  
  
Cells were passaged as normal out of 6xT175 flasks (ID 13421)

  1. Cells were washed with sterile filtered dPBS 
  2. Wash was removed and cells were covered with 10mL of sterile filtered tryple-EDTA per flask. 
  3. Cells were incubated for 30 degrees at 5% CO2 for 10 minutes. 
  4. Cells were collected into 50mL tubes and flasks were washed down with equal volumes of dPBS to tryple 
  5. Washes were also collected to the same tubes 
  6. Cells were centrifuged at 650g for 5 minutes to pellet 
  7. Supernatant was discarded and cells were resuspended in 30mL of dPBS 
  8. 10uL of cells were taken in triplicate for a trypan blue stain at a 1:2 dilution followed by a count under a hemocytometer. (see cell count entry here https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1DPzKubYxfHmWogVPihC-SSIBtIylyrBQE5kRX5Z8NtI/edit#gid=0&range=2799:2802
    1. Cells Count average = 
  9. of cell suspension was taken and seeded into a flask containing 30mL of growth media.
  10. Flask was placed at 30 degrees, 5% CO2 (ID13421) 
  11. Remaining cells  were centrifuged once more as per above and then resuspended in 13mL of CRYOSTOR CS10 media
  12. Cells were moved to 13 cryovials, 1mL per cryovial (~1x10^6 cells per vial) 
  13. Vials were placed in a MR frosty in the -80 in the main lab (ID's 15498-15510)
