AIM/PURPOSE: To isolate & establish culture of endothelial cells.  
LINKED MILESTONE: Establish culture of at least 1 cell type additional to
MuSCs and Fibroblasts.

HYPOTHESIS: That endothelial cells can be isolated from a frozen single cell
suspension of muscle isolate by FACS.

RESULTS SUMMARY: See report

CONCLUSIONS: 1 x vial of ~500,000 cells were banked down.

NEXT STEPS: In the future, we will revive these cells, expand them to an MCB,
and stain for CD31 to verify whether they are endothelial cells.
