Process:

  1. Aliquoted:
    1. 1.5 mL  of  each of the growth media conditions above   

    2. 15 mL of DMEM/F12 + 10% FBS + 1X P/S 
    3. 15 mL of GM + HDAC 1 (0.1ug/mL)  

    4. 15 mL of GM + HDAC 2 (0.1ug/mL)  
Placed in water bath: ~ 14:50  

  2. Collected culture vessels from shakers, wiped with ethanol-sprayed cloth and brought into BSC (if necessary, paused shakers by pressing the "play" button on the controller on the side wall of the incubator)
  3. Using a p1000 for the 6-well plate cultures and a 5 mL serelogical pipette for the E125 flasks, gently pipette-mixed cultures for ~1 minute to break up cell clumps
  4. Pipetted suspensions though 70 um cell strainer into 8 x 15 mL tubes  and 3 x 50 mL flasks (keep E125 flask and 6-well plates in BSC as cultures will be returned to these post centrifugation) 
  5. Centrifuged at 300 x g for 5 min. Timestamp: 15:01 - 15:06    

  6. Aspirated supernatants, taking care to not disrupt or aspirate pellet
  7. Re-suspended all cultures in 500 uL of their respective growth media. 
  8. Took 1 x 20 uL aliquots from all cultures and performed cell count, recording counts in this spreadsheet https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1YuTvXJXQQMIMwRZGeqNjdi20WeURg5FpM-1TJ-zrb1c/edit#gid=787099888
  9. Replaced fresh, warmed media in all cultures 
  10. Gently pipette-mixed cultures again before moving back to E125 flask and 2 x 6-well plates 
  11. Returned vessels to incubator and replaced in clamp. If shaker was paused, remembered to press play to restart shaking. 6-well plates should be shaking at 150 RPM and E125 at 120 RPM) Timestamp:   15:59

### Observations/Summary:

 100 % media changed on vessel(s)

  1. 7502-F_DOLLY12-Sheep P8-1of2
  2. 7503-F_DOLLY12-Sheep P8-2of2
  3. 7504-F_DOLLY12-Sheep P8-1of3
  4. 7505-F_DOLLY12-Sheep P8-2of3
  5. 7506-F_DOLLY12-Sheep P8-3of3  
  
Cell suspensions were not concentrated enough for cell count and so cannot be
sure of accuracy with such low cells per haemocytometer square. Next time will
do 100% feed and re-suspend cells in ~500 uL growth medium
