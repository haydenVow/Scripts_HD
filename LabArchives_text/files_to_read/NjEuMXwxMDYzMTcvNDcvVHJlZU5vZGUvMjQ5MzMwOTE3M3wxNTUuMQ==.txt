Polysaccharides:

  * starch (glucose units linked by glycosidic bonds )
  * cellulose
  * xylan

  

  

Types of starch

  * cassava
  * tapioca starch
  * corn starch - normal or waxy, high amylose (50 or 70%)
  * wheat starch
  * potato starch 
  * sweet potato 

Benifts

  * biocompatable with degraded products not toxic 
  * food safe 
  * good mechanical properties 
  *   

  

\- high composition of amylose would have great stability upon the percent of
elongation with various values of relative humidity.

\- corn starch with high amylose had better properties over all the other
starch varieties [27].

\- In terms of  using local starch resources, starches from native Andean
(South American) crops such as "tunta", "muro-huayro" potato and white carrot
were used as a biofilm and they showed a high level of living cells and cell
viability [28].

Albumin + starch

Bovine serum albumiBenifitn (BSA) and cassava starch used to fabricate 3D
scaffolds using an in-house developed freeze-drying method.

  1. Starch colloidal solution was prepared by mixing cassava starch powder (from Chol Charoen Co., Ltd., Thailand) with distilled water by the concentration of 1.25 % (w/v), boiling for 10 min and then cooling at room temperature. 
  2. The albumin solution was prepared by mixing bovine serum albumin powder (fraction V from Sigma-Aldrich) with distilled water by the concentration of 23.75 % (w/v), stirring for 15 min and then leaving for 10 min to reduce bubbles. 
  3. The starch and albumin solutions were mixed and stirred for 15 min. 
  4. Then, the albumin/starch colloidal solution was transferred into a mold. 
  5. The mold was covered with Parafilm and then put in a freezer at −20 °C. 
  6. After 24 h, the frozen sample was placed in a lyophilizer for 24 h. 
  7. The obtained scaffold was modified by treating with either ethanol or methanol for 15 min in a beaker; then, each scaffold was washed in distilled water for 15 min and again placed in the freezer at −20 °C for 24 h and run through the freeze-drying cycle again. 

  

Results worth mentioning

  * Treatment with ethanol or methanol resulted in larger pore size (may occur due to alcohol washing way some material during lyophilization) 
  * Without treatment, the scaffold degraded within 24 hours in water. With treatment, scaffold lasted for at least 7 days. (data does not show over this) 
  * Used liver cancer cell line (HepG2) to test cell viability. All scaffolds had a vibility of cells > 90%  

  

  




 hydrogels of methylated starch + chitosan + glutaraldehyde cross-linker

https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0021955X13503843

The goal of the study was to evaluate the cytocompatibility of composite
hydrogels of methylated starch and chitosan, using glutaraldehyde as the
cross-linker. Commercial cassava starch with high purity (96.69%) was
methylated with dimethyl sulfate in order to obtain a rigid material that
could possibly render stronger mechanical properties to chitosan hydrogels.
