Aim/Purpose


To determine the ideal seeding density of Nuvonis suspension cells in 50/50
RPMI/CHO and 75/25 RPMI/CHO in terms of the maximum cell density that can be
achieved.


Hypothesis


That flasks seeded with 200K and 400K cells/mL will yield greater maximum cell
densities than flasks seeded with 50 - 100K cells/mL in both 50/50 and 75/25
RPMI/CHO. Additionally, flasks containing 50/50 RPMI/CHO will outperform
flasks seeded at the same cell density in 75/25 RPMI/CHO.


Technical Gap


We have noticed lower doubling rates in flasks seeded at lower seeding
densities <100K cells/mL, however the optimal seeding density has never been
properly tested.


Method/Procedure


  1. D0 (TUES): Seed 12 x E-125s in 75/25 RPMI/CHO and 12 x E-125s in 50/50 RPMI/CHO media at the following densities: 
    1. 3 x E125s @ 50K cells/mL (1M cells in 20 mL)
    2. 3 x E125s @ 100K cells/mL (2M cells in 20 mL) 
    3. 3 x E125s @ 200K cells/mL (4M cells in 20 mL)
    4. 3 x E125s @ 400K cells/mL (8M cells in 20 mL)
  2. D1 (WED): Perform cell counts on all flasks. 
  3. D2, D3 etc: Repeat D1 process until maximum density has been reached in all flasks (informed by plateauing and then declining cell counts) 
  4. Plot growth rate vs. seeding density (line graph) and maximum density vs. seeding density (column graph)
