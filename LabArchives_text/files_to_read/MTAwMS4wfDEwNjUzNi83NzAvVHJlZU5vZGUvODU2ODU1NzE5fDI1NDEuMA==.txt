50% Feed on 10xR850 and 3xRR2125 (normal frequency feeds)
  
  
# Procedure - Feed

# Note: Fibroblasts do NOT require Gelatin coated Flasks, and do NOT require
p38i.  

  1. Turn on the water bath and set to 37'C.
  2. Aliquot  required growth media into a sterile container/s and place into the water bath. 
  3. Place in the water bath and heat for at least 20 minutes.
  4. Observe the cell flasks for confluence under the microscope using 4 x magnification and take images as required. Note: The confluence of cells must be <50% to perform cell feeding in P1-P3 and <80% in P4 prior to the cell differentiation stage. 
  5. Transfer flasks to the BSC and remove required volume of media from each flask (according to the Table below).
  6. Replace the same volume into each flask with the prepared growth media.
  7. Return the flasks to the incubators

Cells have a dimpled look by eye mostly in the middle of the bottle and the
worst in the fast group.

No obvious differences between normal and slow speed bottles. 1 bottle in slow
group had a more obvious dimpled effect. All R850 bottles were at 100 %
confluence.

Many of the fast speed bottles had some small form of aggregation and the most
dimpling effect. (majority of other areas were at 100% confluence)

All RR2125 bottles in all groups were very difficult to observe, even on the
flat surface strip there wasn't many cells and many gaps visible in the ribbed
areas also.
