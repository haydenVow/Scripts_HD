AIM/PURPOSE: Determine if the type of water (MilliQ [Type 1 water] vs bottled
ultrapure vs RO [type 3 water]) used to reconstitute the Hycell CHO media
affects the survival and subsequent proliferation of CHO-S cells

HYPOTHESIS: No negative differences in CHO-S survival and proliferation will
be observed between Hycell media reconstituted in each of the water treatment
conditions.

RESULTS SUMMARY: See final report

CONCLUSIONS: Preliminary results indicate that the water type used to
reconstitute the Hycell CHO powder did not affect the ability of the CHO-S
cells to survive and proliferate. All treatment conditions were either equal
to or performed better than the control in terms of total cell numbers after 8
days in culture, doubling times and cell pellet weight.  

NEXT STEPS:

  * Evaluate different water types with the Nuvonis quail fibroblast suspension cells
