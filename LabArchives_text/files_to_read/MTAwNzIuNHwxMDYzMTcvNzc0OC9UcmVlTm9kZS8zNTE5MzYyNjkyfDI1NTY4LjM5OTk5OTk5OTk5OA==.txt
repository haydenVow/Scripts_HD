### Process:

1\. Took images of vessels with microscope on phase setting, 4x objective
before passage

2\. Aliquotted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then
placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath for a minimum of 20 minutes
prior to use:

  1. TrypLE:     15    mL in     1x15ML    tubes
  2.  dPBS (for neutralising):     15mL    mL
  3.  dPBS (for washing):     15mL    mL

Aliquots were kept at room temperature




4\. Removed vessel(s) from the incubator

5\. Collected supernatant into 50mL tubes then Washed the vessel(s) with dPBS
(warmed) (5mL),

6\. Collected wash to same tubes and added     5    mL tryple to each vessel,
incubated for 8 minutes at 30 degrees, 5% CO2.

7\. Neutralised with     5mL    dPBS and combined cell suspension into tubes
containing collected supernatant and washes.  

8\. Centrifuged at 500 x g for 5 min.




9\. Aspirated the supernatant(s).

10\. Resuspended pellet(s) in     1    mL    dPBS     media.  

11\. Aliquoted     10     of resuspended cells into a microcentrifuge tube for
cell count.

12\. Performed a cell count using the haemocytometer and recorded the cell
count data in the Google Doc spreadsheet: Cell Count Spreadsheet or cell count
widget below

  1. Total cell number was: 
    * ZIC1 2E 2.56x10^6 cells/mL
    * ZIC1 3C 1.68x10^6 cells/mL
    * IGFBP4 3F 2.856x10^6 cells/mL

13 Decided to passage the clones into T175 flasks to boost their numbers
before passage into new suspension cultures in the future, 2xT175 flasks for
ZIC1 2E and IGFBP4 3F, 500uL of cell suspension to each flask. All of ZIC1 3C
added to one T175 flask.




  

14\. Filled 5xT175 flasks with 30mL of cold growth media, left the growth
media for 8 minutes to get closer to room temperature before cells were added
to the flasks as per above.  

16\. Transferred vessel(s) to incubate at:

  * [x]  30ºC, 5% CO2 CHOMP cells, incubator 140
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (avian cells)

Version Change Log

NameChange Details  
V1 (original)N/A  
V2Changed all sentences to past tense to better reflect a hand-written lab
book entry.  
Various formatting changes.  
Addition of more detail to step 2, removal of step 3. Replaced volume
requirements table with updated volumes @Sep 22, 2020  
Updated temperature selection for mammalian/aviary cells @Sep 23, 2020  
V3Included a section for 'vessel type' in passage ID table Replace
'flask/plate' with 'vessel' throughout lab book Include at step 1 to take
image of vessel on the microscope  
Mentioned that dPBS for washing should be warm - step 3(2) and 5.  
Added timepoint at step 4 for when vessel is removed from incubator  
Include at step 11 to aliquot cell resuspension into microcentrifuge tube  
Included at step 10 and 13 time point for when cell pellet is resuspended and
when resuspended cells is moved into growth media.  
Included p38i in table of regent used  
Combined two dPBS entries in 'Media/reagents' table Added 'cell density per
vessel'
