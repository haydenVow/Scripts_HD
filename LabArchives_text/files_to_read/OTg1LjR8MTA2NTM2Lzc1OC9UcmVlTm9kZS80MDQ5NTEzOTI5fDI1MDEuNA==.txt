2xBottles in the VitC ONLY groups are peeling. ~30% peeling

When looking at a control bottle that was 100% confluent the cells visibly
started to peel in the highest confluence areas. Likely due to sheer forces of
the media.

TGFb+VitC bottles was 100% confluent with no signs of peeling by eye or under
the microscope.
