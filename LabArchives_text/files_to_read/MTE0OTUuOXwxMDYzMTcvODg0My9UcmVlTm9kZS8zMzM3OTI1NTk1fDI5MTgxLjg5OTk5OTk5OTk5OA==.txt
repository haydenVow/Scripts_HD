Prepare materials for thaw and seed:

  * Growth media (for washing):    70mL  OPTI media, 10mL KSR media  

  * Pre-filled 6x T75 and 1 xT175 with OptiPro Media, + 1xT75 with KSR media and placed in the incubator to warm and equilibriate, approx 90min prior to use. 
  * Time that aliquot/ flasks were placed in the water/incubator bath to warm before use: 

  




## Thaw and seed vial:  
Performed in 2 batches to reduce the time cells were sitting in cryostor
before wash media was added.

  1. Collected the cryovials from Liquid Nitrogen storage (as per table above) & place in foam floater in water bath for 3 min
  2. `Ethanol sprayed & transferred the vial(s) to the BSC.`
  3. `Added  500ul of Growth Media (to generate a total volume of 1.5mL in the cryovial) to the cryovial, re suspended the cell suspension gently to reduce osmotic shock. `
  4. `Collected the entire cell suspension & transfer into 50mL centrifuge tubes containing 10mL pre-warmed media (KSR media for SILKIE, OPTIPRO for all others)`
  5. `Centrifuge for 5min at 500g`
  6. `Removed 9mL supernatant and re-ssupended cells in the remaining 1mL`
  7. ```Transferred cells into flasks containing pre-warmed and equilibriated media as per the table above.`
  8. `Transfered flask/plate(s) to incubate at ```37ÂºC, 5% CO2, Incubator #77 Library lab. (Between 6:45pm and 7:10pm)
