Procedure

### Cell Harvest

  1. Take the flasks for harvest and observe under the microscope at 4x objective for even cell distribution . Refer to VSOP-006. Take 2-3 images per flask.
  2. Aliquot required volume of dPBS (37C) into sterile pots. 
  3. Place aliquots in pre-warmed water bath and leave for ~20 minutes or until warmed. 
  4. Transfer aliquots and flasks required for harvest into the BSC.
  5. Use a cell scrapper to scrape the cells off the surface of the flask
  6. Collect growth media and loose aggregates from each flask into centrifuge tubes.
  7. If required (for flasks containing loose cells) wash with warmed dPBS, then collect this also into centrifuge tubes.
  8. Centrifuge at 700 x g for 5 minutes.````
  9. Gently remove centrifuge tubes from the machine, ensuring not to disturb the cell pellets. Aspirate as much supernatant as possible from the tubes. Discard supernatant. Remove as much remaining supernatant with a 1mL pipette.

### Re-pellet and Weigh Final Yield

  1. Label and Record the weight of 1 sterile centrifuge tube and set aside. Record details in Widget.  
  2. Add growth media to each centrifuge tube and resuspend cells. Refer to the table below for the required amount of growth media to be added.
  3. Combine all resuspended cells into the weighed centrifuge tube. 
  4. Wash all empty centrifuge tubes with growth media and add this to the centrifuge tube containing the resuspended cells. 
  5. Centrifuge at 700 x g x 5 minutes. 
  6. Aspirate the supernatant from the tube. Remove as much remaining supernatant with a 1mL pipette.
  7. Record the final weight of the cell pellet. Enter details in Widget. 
  8. Immediately provide to the food team for testing.

Note: For bottle 2 harvest the aggregate was bunched up around the rim off the
bottle so sterile tweezers were used to detach it from the surface. Once it
was detached it fell into the bottle and a serological pipette was used to
transfer it into the weighed centrifuge tube. Due to the very minimal amount
of liquid also trasnfered, this harvest was not spun in the centrifuge,
instead a 1mL pipette was used to remove this excess liquid and the pellet was
then weighed.

For bottle 3 the usual harvest method of scraping was used, followed a dPBS
wash and spinning in the centrifuge.
