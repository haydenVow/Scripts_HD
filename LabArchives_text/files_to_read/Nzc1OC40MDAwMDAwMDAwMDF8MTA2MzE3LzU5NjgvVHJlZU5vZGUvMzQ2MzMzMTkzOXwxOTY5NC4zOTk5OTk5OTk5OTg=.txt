## Performed by: Bonnie  




Note: Because of the extremely slow rate of detachment of cells by
tyrplisation, a 30min tyrplisation was followed by 10minute in trypsin, after
which cells were combined. See details bellow.

Media/Reagents used:

  

NameDetails (reagent ID)  
Tryple A7592  
  
dPBS (for washing & neutralising) M9214  
  
Growth Media M9243  
  
0.25% Trypsin- EDTA  
  
  
  




Process:

1\. Imaged each plate on 10x and 10x magnification.

2\. Aliquotted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then
placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath for a minimum of 20 minutes
prior to use:

  1. TrypLE:     10  mL in    1   tubes
  2. dPBS (for washing and neutralising)   30   mL in     1  tubes
  3. Growth media (for seeding):   100    mL in    1    tub
  4. Times that all aliquots were placed in the water bath to warm before use   10:25

Note: if aliquots were placed in water bath at different times, record the
time stamp for each individual solution.




2\. Washed the flask(s) 2x with with dPBS. note: washed 2x as cells took 25
min to trypilise at last passage.

3\. Added     3mL (T25) or 0.5mL(12 well plate)  tryple to each vessel/well
and incubated at 37˚C for    30   min.

WALLE06: 10:50  
WALLE07: 10:50  
WALLE09: 11:05

4\. Neutralised with dPBS (warmed) transferred cell suspension into a   50mL
tube per cell line.

5\. Centrifuged at 650 x g for 5 min

WALLE06:  11:24  
WALLE07: 11:24  
WALLE09: 11:40  

  




6\. Aspirated the supernatant(s)

7\. Resuspended pellet(s) in      2  mL      growth  media (WALLE07).  
Resuspended pellet(s) in      1 mL      growth  media (WALLE06 and WALLE09).

8\. Performed a cell count using the haemocytometer and recorded the cell
count data in widget or the Google Doc spreadsheet called 'Cell Count
Spreadsheet' (see link below):

Additional incubation with 0.25% Trypsin-EDA  
As a large number of cells remained attached to the vessels after a 30min
incubation in trypsin, an additional incubation in trypsin was performed.

  1. Placed 10mL of 0.25% trypsin-EDTA to the waterbath and warmed for 15min
  2. Added     3mL (T25) or 0.5mL(12 well plate)  trypsin to each vessel/well and incubated at 37˚C for    10   min 11:55  

  3. Removed trypsin/cells from flasks and transfered to existing tubes containing the cells that were dissascociated by the tryple and mixed.

  4. Centrifuged at 650 x g for 5 min 12:05  

  5. Aspirated the supernatant(s)

7\. Resuspended pellet(s) in      0.5  mL      growth  media.

8\. Performed a cell count using the haemocytometer and recorded the cell
count data in widget or the Google Doc spreadsheet called 'Cell Count

13\. Transfer cell suspension into flasks/plates.

WALLE06: seeded into 5x wells of a 6-well plate, 7,380/cm  
WALLE07: seeded into 1x T75, 7,626/cm  
WALLE09: seeded into 2x wells of 12 well plate, 8,214/cm

14\. Transfer flask/plate(s) to incubate at: 12:55

  




Observations/Summary:

Cell counts obtained from each culture were much lower than expected given the
confluence observed prior to passaging. Tyrpelisation was extremely slow and
due to concerns about cell stress, it was stopped at 30minutes however there
were still many cells attached to the base of the vessels. Subsequent use of
trypsin on the remaining cells, and pooling of all cells resulted in an
increased cell count in 2 of the 3 cultures. Tryple does not appear to be
efficient in disassociating plastic adherent WALLE cells, I would recommend
trialling the use of 0.25% trypsin EDTA for the next passage.
