Aim/Purpose


To generate a standard curve for adherent CHOMP and suspension CHO-S cells
with an XTT assay and to determine the minimum number of cells detected with
this assay.


Hypothesis


That we will plot a standard curve for adherent CHOMP and suspension CHO-S
cells and that the XTT assay will be sensitive enough to detect wells with 50
cells.


Technical Gap


We have not tested XTT assays to assess CHOMP or CHO-S confluence at Vow, and
do not know whether the assay will be sensitive enough and/or suitable for our
purposes with single-cell cloning.


Method/Procedure


Experimental Plan

  1. D0: Thaw CHOMP fibroblasts and CHO-S cells and seed 2 x 96-wp as shown below:  

  2. D1: Add XTT reagent to plates (follow manual instructions). 
    * Run on plate reader at 1H 
    * Run on plate reader at 4H 
  3. D2: Run on plate reader (1D) 
  4. D6: Run on plate reader (5D) 
  5. D8: Run on plate reader (7D) 
  6. D10: Run on plate reader (9D)
  7. D13: Run on plate reader (12D) 
  8. D15: Run on plate reader (14D)
  9. D17: Run on plate reader (16D) 
  10. Plot graphs for each plate reader run to generate standard curve and monitor how readings change over incubation periods
