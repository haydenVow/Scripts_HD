Process

Passage  

  1. Prepared new media:
    * 260 mL new media + 1:1000 IGF + 1:5000 EGF
    * Added media to bead bath at 15:06
  2. Added cell suspension from culture ID xxxxx (B) to new flasks x2. Per flask, added:
    * 30 mL cell suspension + 130 mL new media. Flask type = E500
    * performed passage at 15:40
  3. Returned flasks to incubator:
    * at 15:40 
    * at 180 000 cells/mL
    * 120 RPM
    * 37degC 5% CO2

Cryopreserve

  1. Prepared freeze medium:
    * 1.8 mL DMSO + 10.2 mL growth medium
    * 12 mL growth medium
    * Placed the above in bead bath at xx:xx
  2. Aspirated cell suspension from flasks:
    * 160 mL flask ID xxxxx (A)
    * 20 mL flask ID xxxxx (B)
  3. Deposited into 50mL falcon tubes and centrifuged at 310xg for 5 minutes at 15:45
  4. Aspirated supernatant and resuspended in 12 mL growth medium
  5. Diluted cell suspension 1:2 by drop-wise addition of DMSO+media to bring to 7.5% DMSO final concentration at 15:55
  6. Pipetted 1mL per tube into prepared and labelled cryovials
  7. Placed cryovials in foam Mr Frosty and moved to -80degC freezer at 16:00
