22-APR-21 Prepare Zein in 96-well plate


  1. Aliquotted 60uL/well into wells C3-F9 of a 96-well plate.
  2. Transferred 1 zein piece into each well containing poly-l-lysine solution from the zein equillibrated in growth media overnight.
  3. Not enough liquid to cover each piece so additional 60uL/well of poly-l-lysine added to each scaffold.

Note* At this point (9:30 am) it was decided to go ahead with non-coated
scaffolds to see a greater comparison between the co-culture vs mono-culture
samples at later time points.

  

  1. A new 96-well plate was collected and 1 x zein scaffold (incubated in dPBS overnight) was added to each well between C3-F9 (28 wells total).
  2. Lid left ajar to dry scaffolds `10am` whilst cells being harvested


22-APR-21 Prepare Growth Media


Prepare 10mL of Growth Media + 50ug/mL L-ascorbic acid

Note* stock solution of LAA2P = 100mg/mL (100,000ug/mL)

  1. Mix 10mL of DMEM/F12 + 20% FBS + 1X P/S with 5uL of LAA2P (100mg/mL stock conc.). Sterile filter with syringe and 0.22um filter unit.
  2. Aliquot 10mL of DMEM/F12 + 20% FBS + 1X P/S.
  3. Warm at 37C.
