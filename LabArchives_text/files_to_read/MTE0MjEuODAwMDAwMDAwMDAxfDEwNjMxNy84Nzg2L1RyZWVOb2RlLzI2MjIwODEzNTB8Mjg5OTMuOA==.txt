3\. Cells from flask 12735 and 12736 were combined and spun down for 5 mins.

4\. Supernatant removed and resuspended in 25 mL.

5\. Cells were mixed in 1 x 2L roller bottle. A cell count was conducted:

6\. The 2L of cells were split across 2x E5000. As 1M cells/mL is too many
cells, an extra 1L of media was added to each flask.

7\. A final cell count of the 2 Flasks was conducted and recorded below:
