### Process:

1\. Took image of vessel with microscope on phase setting.

3\. Aliquotted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then
placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath for a minimum of 20 minutes
prior to use:

  1. TrypLE:     40    mL in     1    tubes
  2.  dPBS (for neutralising):      40   mL
  3.  dPBS (for washing):     40    mL
  4. Growth media (for pellet resuspension):  20  mL
  5. Growth media (for seeding):    360  mL 

Time that all aliquots were placed in the water bath the warm before use
10:21 am  

Note: if aliquots were placed in water bath at different time, record the time
stamp for each individual solution.




4\. Removed vessel(s) from the incubator     :   a/pm

5\. Washed the vessel(s) with dPBS (warmed).

6\. Added    10     mL tryple to each vessel/well and incubated at 37˚C.

  1. Start/Finish for TrypLE was     10:49 - 11:00  am 

7\. Neutralised with    10mL/flask      dPBS and combined cell suspension into
a     2 x 50mL    tube.

8\. Centrifuged at 650 x g for 5 min.

  1. Start/Finish time for centrifugation was    11:13 - 11:18   am 




9\. Aspirated the supernatant(s).

10\. Resuspended pellet(s) in         mL          media     :   a/pm

11\. Aliquoted          of resuspended cells into a microcentrifuge tube for
cell count.

12\. Performed a cell count using the haemocytometer and recorded the cell
count data in the Google Doc spreadsheet: Cell Count Spreadsheet or cell count
widget below

  1. Total cell number was:    22,752,000  
  2. Volume of cell suspension required for subculture was:           
  3. Cell density per vessel:          




13\. Transferred           µl of cell suspension to the pre-warmed
mL Growth media:      :    a/pm

14\. Transferred cell suspension into the pre-gelatin coated
vessel.

15\. Left at RT in the BSC for 30 min to allow cells to settle      :  \-  :
a/pm  

16\. Transferred vessel(s) to incubate at:

  * [X ]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (avian cells)
