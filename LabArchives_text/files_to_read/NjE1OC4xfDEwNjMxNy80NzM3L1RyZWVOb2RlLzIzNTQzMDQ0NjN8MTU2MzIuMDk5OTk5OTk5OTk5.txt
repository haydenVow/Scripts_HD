### Preparation of reagents  

For Passage: Heat the following to 30C in the water bath

  1. TrypLE:     500 mL in      1  tub
  2.  dPBS (for neutralising):   500  mL
  3.  dPBS (for washing):     500 mL
  4. DMEM + 20% FBS + 1 x PS for pellet resuspension + Seeding):    5 L (additional 4L added at 09:00-09-20)

Time that all aliquots were placed in the water bath the warmed to 30C before
use  07:55

Note: if aliquots were placed in water bath at different time, record the time
stamp for each individual solution.




Passage  

  1. Washed the vessel(s) with dPBS (warmed). 08:20
  2. Added 10ml tryple to each vessel/well and incubated at 30ËšC.
  3. Start/Finish for TrypLE was   08:22-08:34  

  4. Neutralised each with with   dPBS (equal to volume of tryple) and transferred to  4x 250mL tube.
  5. Centrifuged at 650 x g for 5 min.
  6. Start time for centrifugation was  08:45
  7. Aspirated the supernatant(s).
  8. Resuspended pellet(s) in   100 mL   growth  media
  9.  Aliquoted   50uL  of resuspended cells into a micro centrifuge tube for cell count.
  10. Performed a cell count using the haemocytometer and recorded the cell count data in the Google Doc spreadsheet called 'Cell Count Spreadsheet' (see link below):

SSIBtIylyrBQE5kRX5Z8NtI/edit#gid=0  

    1. Total cell count was: 252,000,000
    2. Re-seeded approximately cells into  6x 10CFs, giving a seeding density of 6645/cm
    3.  Incubate at 30C and 5% CO2. 09:50
