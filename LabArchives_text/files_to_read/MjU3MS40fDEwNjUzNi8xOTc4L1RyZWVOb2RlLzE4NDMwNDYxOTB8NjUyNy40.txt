Cell suspension pumped into new palletank bag (Lot No. A0045488, STK: 6901).  
170L removed from the STR200 using the harvest tube line with the pumpable
tubing.  
  
Started removing cell suspension: 0935  
Finished removing cell suspension: 1005

Original volume: 195.55 L

After draw volume: 20L  
  
Performed by: CB, AV, SR


Harvest


Performed by (centrifuge MFG): SR/ME/CB/LP/AK  
STARTED: 10:53

FINISHED: 12:20

  * After being drawn out of the STR200 the cell suspension was fed into the new centrifuge. = 170L
  * The flow rate was set at 4L/min and the centrifuge was set at full speed (60 RPM)
  * Waste media samples taken at start and middle from flow. Sample taken from waste tub. Max cell density of waste media:2500-5000 cells/mL

Remaining 5L from large centrifuge further centrifuged in benchtop centrifuge
(1000xg, 10mins).

Predicted mass: 950g

Actual mass: 754 g

  




Procedure

Before starting Media Top Up perform a microscope check to ensure there is no
contamination in the Bioreactor OR media containing vessel.

  1. Connect the media containing vessel to the STR200 or STR2000 in a sterile manner
  2. Use a peristaltic pump to pump media into the Bioreactor at a moderate speed
  3. Once the desired volume is reached immediately clamp the lines to prevent back flow
  4. Dis-connect the Media containing vessel from the bioreactor

Notes:

\- Media collection from different media batches: ALQ: 13133,
13132,13134,13250, 13255, 13257, 13254, 13252, 13246

Centrifugation Notes:

\- Large centrifuge failed to produce pellet and instead created an opaque
soup like suspension

\- After benchtop centrifugation, supernatant checked under a microscope and
significant cell debris was confirmed.

\- Suggestions for centrifuge optimisation:

  1. Lower speed to 1000 xg
