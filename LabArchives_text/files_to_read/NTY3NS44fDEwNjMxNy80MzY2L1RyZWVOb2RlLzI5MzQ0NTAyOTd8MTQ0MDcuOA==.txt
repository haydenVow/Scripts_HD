Prepare materials for thaw and seed:

1\. Aliquotted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then
placed all aliquots to warm at 30C in the water bath for a minimum of 20
minutes prior to use:

  *  Growth media (for seeding):    30mL 
  * Time that aliquot was placed in the water bath to warm before use:   13:30-14:50  

  




## Thaw and seed vial:

Collected the cryovial from Liquid Nitrogen storage & place in foam floater in
water bath for 4 min  14:49-14:53  

Location where cryovial was collected from:

Vial details:  3   xcryovials at estimated   500K  cells each for a total of
1.5M  cells

`Ethanol sprayed & transferred the vial(s) to the BSC.```

  1. `Added  500µL of Growth Media to each vial (to generate a total volume of 1mL in the cryovial) to the cryovial, resuspended the cell suspension gently to reduce osmotic shock. `
  2. `Combined all cells in a 15ml tube  
`

  3. `Took a 20ul sample to perform a cell count and put aside`````
  4. `Collected the entire cell suspension & transfer into the pre-warmed 30mL tube of Growth Media. `
  5. Performed cell count using retained cells, and trypan blue stain + manual count. See cell count table here: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1DPzKubYxfHmWogVPihC-SSIBtIylyrBQE5kRX5Z8NtI/edit#gid=0 Total cell number was: 1,1380,000. Decided to seed 1x T175 flasks to give a seeding density of 7,885 cells/cm
  6. `Using a 10mL serological pipette, resuspended & distributed the cells evenly in the  30mL of pre-warmed Growth Media.`
  7. `Transferred  to 1x T175 flask```
  8. `Transferred flask/plate(s) to incubate at: 15:05`
