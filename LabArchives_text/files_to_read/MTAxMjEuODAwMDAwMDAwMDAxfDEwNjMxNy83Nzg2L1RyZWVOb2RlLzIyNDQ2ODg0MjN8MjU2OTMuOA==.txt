Process:

  1. Placed the  50 mL aliquot of  Growth Media in the bead bath set at 37 C for 20 minutes or until warm to the touch. 14:00-14:21
  2. Removed  15 mL (50%) supernatant from each vessel (you can use the same tip for the 3 x T175 as they contain the same batch of cells).
  3. Replaced with 15 mL of growth media per well/per vessel  (once again, you can use the same tip for the 3 x T175 as they contain the same batch of cells).
  4. Returned vessel to incubate at: 14:39

### Observations/Summary:

50  % media changed on vessel(s) and images taken of cultures.  
  
Culture 11833 appears to be somewhat less confluent than cultures 11832 and
11831. Images attached below (10x mag. at phase contrast)
