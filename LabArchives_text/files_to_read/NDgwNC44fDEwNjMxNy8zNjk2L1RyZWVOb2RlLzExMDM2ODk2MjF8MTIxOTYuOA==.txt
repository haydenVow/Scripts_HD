Prepare materials for thaw and seed:

1\. Gelatin coated   4 x  T175  flasks/plates with sterile filtered 0.1%
gelatin solution and then incubated all coated flasks at 37ºC  (Note: 1 vial
is seeded into 3 x T175)

  * Time when all flasks placed into the incubator  11 :30 a/pm 

2\. Aliquotted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then
placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath for a minimum of 20 minutes
prior to use:

  *  Growth media (for seeding):    60mL of D/F + 20%FBS + 1xP/S +p38i  and    60mL of D/F + 20%FBS + 1xP/S + LAA2P \+ p38i  

  * Time that aliquot was placed in the water bath to warm before use:   12:28 pm 

  




## Thaw and seed vial:

  1. Collected the cryovial from Liquid Nitrogen storage & place in foam floater in water bath for 5 min   13:29 - 13:34 pm 
  2. Location where cryovial was collected from: 

Vial details:  1   x  DOLLY12  WCB cryovials at   540K  cells each for a total
of    540K  cells

` `

  1. `Ethanol sprayed & transferred the vial(s) to the BSC.`
  2. `Added 600 µL of Growth media (to generate a total volume of 1.1 mL in the cyrovial) to the cyrovial, reuspended the cell suspension gently to reduce osmotic shock. `
  3. `measure total volume of cell suspension with a 1000uL pipette - need around 1.1mL  
`

  4. Add 500 uL of cell suspension into each media type. 
  5. `Using a serological pipette, resuspend and distribute the cells evenly in the   60mL of pre-warmed Growth media. `
  6. `Transfered   30 mL to each pre-coated   T175 flask/well, allow to rest in the BSC at RT for 30 minutes  13:45 - 14:15 pm ```
  7. `Transfered flask/plate(s) to incubate at: `

  * [X]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells) THERMO
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (aviary cells)

Meanwhile,

  1. With remaining ~100uL of cell suspension in the vial, perform cell count. 
  2. Obtained 594000 cells.
