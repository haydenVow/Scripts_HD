NOTES

  




Temperature data




  

Biopsies to be collected from the vaticus heads.






Note: please take just 3 biopsies of about 4-6g each, and then 1 larger biopsy
of around 10g. This is so that we can take pieces off the larger biopsy and
freeze them for genomics/proteomics/histology. Please put the large biopsy in
tube 154.




Process:

  1. Prepared for biopsy:

    1. Surgical drapes

    2. Iodine spray/solution
    3. 70% ethanol bottle

    4. Lab coats

    5. Gloves

    6. Sterile guaze 

    7. Sterile forceps

    8. Sterile scalpels 
    9. Sterile scissors 
    10. Hair clippers 
    11. Rediwipes 
    12. Permanent markers
    13. 50mL tubes stored in the fridge until use:
      1.  DMEM/F12 + 1% v/v P/S

      2. PBS + 1% v/v P/S

Details of animal biopsy harvest & transportation:

  1. Removed meat from fridge- 0.94kg bag.  11:25
    1. Second tissue piece removed from fridge 12:25 pm (weight = 0.958 kg)
  2. Sprayed the surface of the leg with 70% ethanol, gently dab with sterile gauze.
  3. Poured iodine solution into sterile gauze and dabbed it over the surface of the leg. Left this on for 5 min

  4.   

    1. 11:37-11:42

    2. 12:30 pm - 12:35 pm

  5. Gently dabbed away excess with sterile gauze

  6. REPEAT STEPS 2-4. Iodine :

  7.   

    1.  11:45-11:50

    2. 12:38 - 12:43 pm

Process for collecting muscle biopsies:

  1. `First cut a square (not too deep) to remove the skin`

  2. Changed scalpels and tweezers (as the outer layer may be contaminated). Cut another square into the tissue (not too deep). Removed this - It will not be used as it may be contaminated.

  3. Changed scalpels and tweezers and take biopsies 

Process for collecting dermal biopsies:

  1. Using scalpels and tweezers, pull and cut away the thin outer white layer from the surface of the sample

  2. Placed each biopsy in a tube containing DMEM/F12 + 1x P/S. 

  3. Once all biopsies have been taken. Transferred biopsies to tubes containing PBS + 1x P/S.

  4. Transfer tubes containing biopsies to the lab
    1. Tube 1 was taken into the lab ahead of the others so that processing could begin ASAP - time = 12:20 pm
    2. Samples 2-4 : 1:15pm
    3.
