Process:

  1. Zaber scan 384 wp on phase (5x, exposure: 50, illuminator lamp: ~1). 
  2. Removed 20uL/well of media from columns 13-24. (This was done to bring down the well volumes to 50uL/well which is what we have on day 7 of single cell cloning, before a feed is performed).
  3. Prepared 2 mL of 50uL/ml of sterile Hoechst in PBS solution using 'new' Hoechst (stock ID: 3722 )
  4. Prepared 2 mL of 60uL/mL of sterile Hoechst in PBS solution using 'new' Hoechst (stock ID: 3722 )
  5. Prepared 1 mL each of 50uL/mL and 60uL/mL of sterile Hoechst in PBS solution using 'old' Hoechst (stock ID: 2562 )
  6. Added 20uL/well of staining solutions to wells as follows:
    1. B13-B24 = 50uL/mL, new. Same for C13-C24, D13-D24, E13-E24
    2. F13-F24 = 60uL/mL,  new. Same for G13-G24, H13-H24, I13-24, J-13-24
    3. N13-N24 = 50uL/mL, old
    4. O13-O24 = 60uL/mL, old
  7. Incubated plate at room temp in BSC in the dark: ~19:40 - 20:05
  8. Aliquoted 7.5 mL D/F + 10% FBS + 1x P/S and place in waterbath. 13:33 
  9. Imaged all stained wells, as well as unstained wells (K,L,M,N from 13-24 = control) 
    1. 5x (all)
    2. Phase: exposure 40, illuminator lamp: ~1
    3. DAPI: exposure 200 (for rows B to N), illuminator lamp: 55
    4. DAPI: exposure 20, lamp 55 for rows O and P (these were stained with old Hoechst and were very bright)
  10. Performed a 100% feed on columns 13-24 (50uL/well added after removing media)
  11. Returned plate to incubator ~20:40
    1. 37 degrees, 5% CO2, ID #68




Observations/Summary:

Hoechst stained wells with old and new Hoechst, imaged and performed a 100%
feed.

  

Plate stained: 8123
