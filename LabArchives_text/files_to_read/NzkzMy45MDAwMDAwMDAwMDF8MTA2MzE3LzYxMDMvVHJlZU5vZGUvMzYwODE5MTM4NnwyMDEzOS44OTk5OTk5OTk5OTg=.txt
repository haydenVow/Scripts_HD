Process

  1. Collected E125s from shaker, wiped with ethanol-sprayed Rediwipe, and brought into BSC 
  2. Using a 25 mL serelogical pipette, gently pipette-mixed culture to break up cell clumps
  3. Took 100 uL samples from each culture and transferred to separate wells in a 96-WP, recording the location of each sample for future plate mapping 
  4. Gently pipette-mixed cultures using serological, before moving cell suspension back to E125s
  5. Returned E125s to incubator 12:10

Staining

Prepare reagents

Prepared dead stain solution in amber/black centrifuge tube:  
\- 2 mL dPBS  
\- 2 drops Nucgreen AF488 dead stain  
Vortex for 5 seconds to mix

Prepared Hoechst stain (50 ug/mL) solution in amber/black centrifuge tube:  
\- 9500 uL MilliQ  
\- 500 uL Hoechst Trihydrochloride trihydrate (1mg/mL)  
Vortex for 5 seconds to mix. Solution can be stored at 4°C for up to 6 months

Stain plates

  1. Added 100 uL dPBS into plate columns 3, 4, 9 and 10 using a multichannel pipette
  2. Added 100 uL of dead stain solution (dPBS+Sytox) to cells
  3. Serially diluted cell suspension by transferring 100 uL cell suspension to subsequent wells, down to 25% dilution
  4. Stained samples with 20 uL of Hoechst stain solution
  5. Incubated for 30 minutes in the dark at room temperature 12:55
  6. Centrifuged plates at 300 RCF for 1 minute 13:25
  7. Prepared plate maps PLATE ID: 9601

## Imaging

  1. Configure the Zaber session to image the entirety of each well; for 96 well plates this requires a 3 x 3 stitched image
  2. Take images of each well on the blue fluroescence ("DAPI") and green fluorescence ("AF488") channels




## Analysis

  1. Analyzed the blue- and green-channel images using the DAPI and AF488 MIA macros respectively.
  2. Downloaded and extracted the data then pasted it into the "MIA output" data workbook created in the "Staining" section.
  3. Copied the data from the "Final output" sheet of the "MIA output" data workbook to the "Master Cell Counting Sheet" of the "Suspension culture counting spreadsheet": https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1YuTvXJXQQMIMwRZGeqNjdi20WeURg5FpM-1TJ-zrb1c/edit?usp=sharing
  4. Following cell count analysis, assessed culture performance as per culture performance criteria:
    * Cells flatline at a very low level (less than 10% of seed number) after 5 weeks - discard
    * Cells plateau at a moderate number (more than 25% of seed number) after 5 weeks - retain
    * Cells begin to proliferate - move culture to larger vessel and add appropriate volume of fresh medium to keep cell concentration in 0.1 - 1 million cells/mL range. Once total cell count reaches at least 20 million, bank down into MCB.
