Seed 4 pieces of zein at 0.8M and 1.2 M cells per scaffold.




After harvest

  1. gelatin coat 24 WP - 14:28
  2. Transferred cell suspension (for scaffold seeding) and place in a 15 ml tube. 
    1. 1.2M = 3.566mL of cell sus
    2. 0.8 = 2.377mL of cell sus
    3. control (14K) = 42uL of cell sus - seed directly into 24wp 
  3. Centrifuged cells for scaffold seeding at 650g for 5 min (needed to be able to resuspend in less growth media for denser cell suspension)
  4. Timestamp: 15:19 - 15:24  pm
  5. Resuspend each pellet in 260uL of growth media
  6. Seed each scaffold with 60 uL of cell resuspension. 
  7. Pipetted 60 uL of growth media into the 2 remaining cell free scaffold 
  8.  Allowed to rest in BSC for 30 minutes.
  9. Timestamp: 15:33 - 16:03
  10. Added 170ul growth media to scaffolds to make volume up to 230 uL 
  11. Transferred flask/plate(s) to incubate at: 
  12. [x]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  13. [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (aviary cells)
