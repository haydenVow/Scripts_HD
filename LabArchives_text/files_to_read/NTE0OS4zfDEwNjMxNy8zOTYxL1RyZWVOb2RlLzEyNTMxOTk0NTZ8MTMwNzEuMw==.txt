Process:

  1. Aliquotted  5 mL  mL of  Growth Media 
    1. Placed in water bath   14:37    

  2. Collected T25 from incubator and imaged culture, noting any observations below
  3. Moved cell suspension to 15 mL tube 
  4. Centrifuged culture at 300 x g for 5 min 15:45-15:50
  5. Removed  100 % of supernatant from vessel. 
  6. Added 100 uL of growth medium to pellet, resuspended, and took 1 x 10 uL sample 
  7. Performed cell count on haemocytometer, recording observations 
    1. Cell count: 91,600 
  8. Re-suspended pellet in  5 mL of   warmed growth  media. 
  9. Gently pipette-mixed to re-suspend pellet and moved back to T25 flask
  10. Returned vessel to incubate at:
