The dip tube line that was used to pump cell suspension out of the STR200 has
some dried up white residue in the line. This is likely to be glutamine or
growth factor from the last top up. This is not the first time this has been
seen, making a note in case of unusual reg test results.


Draw


Cell suspension pumped into the old palletank bag (Lot No. A0045488)that
previously held the media in the STR200.  
110L removed from the STR200 using the dip tube line with the pumpable tubing.
The yellow pump was not strong enough to pump this out, so the grey pump was
used instead. Pump speed 141RPM  
  
Started removing cell suspension: 8:30am  
Finished removing cell suspension: 9:03am

Original volume: 184000mL

After draw volume: 73690mL  
  
Performed by: SR/CB/ME

  


Harvest


Performed by (centrifuge MFG): SR/ME

Performed by (centrifuge Lab and sample collection): CB/AK  
  

  * After being drawn out of the STR200 the cell suspension was fed into the new centrifuge.
  * The flow rate was set at 4L/min and the centrifuge was set at full speed (___)
  * The centrifuge failed to produce a cell pellet and instead produced 5L of very concentrated cell suspension
  * This cell suspension was taken into the lab and spun in a lab centrifuge using 250mL and 500mL centrifuge tubes.
    * The tubes were spun at 1000 rcf for 5min.
    * It is very hard to successfully spin down cells when they are in a solution as concentrated as this so the tubes were spun, the supernatant poured into another tube and then the supernatant was spun again. This was repeated several times until the pellet because significantly smaller even though the cell suspension was still quite cloudy.

Harvest samples/weights:

  * 110g for nutritional testing (-20 freezer)
  * 93g for antibiotic testing (-20 freezer)
  * 82g for bacterial/fungal testing (-20 freezer)
  * 2x pellets from 50mL for genetic drift (sterile sample, flash frozen, -80 freezer)
  * 2x pellets from 50mL for growth factor testing (sterile sample, flash frozen, -80 freezer)
  * 2x 3mL supernatant mycoplasma samples (sterile sample, -80 freezer)
  * 2x spare pellets from mycoplasma sample (sterile sample, -80 freezer)

We also obtains 58g extra for Adem.  
  
TOTAL HARVEST WEIGHT = 344g
