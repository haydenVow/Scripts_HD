Hoechst staining protocol.

Trial staining was first performed on N=1 scaffold (seeded by JB on 15/04/21)-
Non sterile

  

1. N=1 scaffold (seeded by JB on 15/04/21) #6403 was transferred to a new 96 well plate.  

2\. 5ul of Hoechst stain was added to 245ul of growth media.  

3\. Scaffold covered with 100ul/well of Hoechst/media mix and incubated cells
at 37°C for 10 minutes, protected from light. 13:20-13:30

4\. Wash with 2x with 200ul PBS for 5 minutes. 13:32, 13:37  
5\. Imaged.  

  

After successful trial staining, Hoechst staining was performed on more
scaffolds.

Note: Perform all staining in the BSC.

Prepare 1ml per well for 24well plates, and 100ul per well for 96 well plates.
Use Hoechst at 20ul/mL.

  

  1. Prepared Hoechst stain by adding 2800ul of Hoechst to 3ml of growth media. 16:00
  2. Hoeschst/media mix was sterilised using a syringe filter. 
  3. Media was removed from N=4 cell seeded scaffolds and N=4 cell free scaffolds in plate 6405 as well N=4 2D wells on plate 6392  

  4. Covered these wells with 100ul hoechst/media mix and incubate cells at 37°C for 10 minutes, protected from light. 16:
  5. Removed hoechst/media mix. 
  6. Wash with 2x with 200ul PBS for 5 minutes.
  7. Replaced PBS with fresh growth media for imaging. 
  8. Imaged. 
  9. After imaging returned to plates incubate at 37°C and 5% CO2.  
  
Reagents  
Hoeschst: 1403  
DMEM/F12 + 20%FBS +1x p/s: 4235, p38i 3978

Live Dapi staining protocol.

Note: Perform all staining in the BSC.

Prepare 1ml per well for 24well plates, and 100ul per well for 96 well plates.
Use DAPI at 10 ug/mL (10x amount used for fixed cells).

  

  1. Prepare dapi stain by adding 20ul of Dapi to 2ml growth media.   

  2. Removed culture medium from N=4 wells in 96 well plate #6329 and replaced with 100ul/well Dapi/media mix. Incubated at 37°C for 5 minutes, protected from light. 17:05-17:10
  3. Wash with 2x with 100ul PBS for 5 minutes. 17:10-17:15, 17:15-17:20  

  4. Replace PBS with fresh E6 media. 
  5. Image. 
  6. After imaging return to plates incubate at 37°C and 5% CO2.   
  
Reagents  
Dapi: 2193  
DMEM/F12 + 20% FBS +1x p/s: 4235 + p38i 3978  
PBS: 4218

  




Images and observations

When staining with Hoechst, far fewer cells were seen attached to the scaffold
on plate 6405 (EPL coated samples) compared to the trial scaffold taken from
plate 6403 (non-coated). This was unexpected because the same seeding and
staining protocol was used. The low attachment of cells to scaffolds on plate
6405 may be due to the long (overnight) EPL coating time used in this
experiment (normally only 1hr).

SCAFFOLDS DISCARDED - Due to the low apparent attachment of cells to scaffolds
on plate 6405, this plate was discarded. EPL coating on these scaffolds was
performed overnight, rather than for the usual 1 hour. See: https://au-
mynotebook.labarchives.com/. It is theorised that this has affected cell
attachment. This arm of the experiment will need to be repeated.  
  
Test for effects of Hoechst on cell survival will continue with the remaining
2D seeded cells which did not endure EPL coating.




Observations -  
The media in the wells of plate 6405 containing the EPL coated and dried
scaffolds was very pink on D1 after seeding. Whereas samples on the 6403 plate
(non coated wet and dry scaffolds) were yellow in colour by D1. The pink media
colouration suggested a lower cell presence in these wells. This pink
colouration could infer that the presence of EPL had a negative effect on cell
survival. Wherein, typically even cells growing on the base of the well will
cause media discolouration.
