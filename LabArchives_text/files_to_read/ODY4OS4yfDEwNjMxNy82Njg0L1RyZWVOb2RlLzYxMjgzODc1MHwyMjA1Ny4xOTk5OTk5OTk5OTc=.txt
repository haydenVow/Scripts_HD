### Process:

1\. Aliquotted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then
placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath for a minimum of 20 minutes
prior to use:

  1. Growth media (for seeding):   30  mL 

Time that all aliquots were placed in the water bath the warm before use
11:27  

Note: if aliquots were placed in water bath at different time, record the time
stamp for each individual solution.




2\. Removed vessel from the incubator

3\. Transfer the entire contents into sterile 50 mL flacon tube

4\. Removed 10 uL sample from culture and performed cell count. Count =

5\. Discarded __ mL of cell suspension ( __ cells) so 1,500,000 cells remain

6\. Centrifuged remaining cell suspension at 300 x g for 5 min.

  1. Start/Finish time for centrifugation was      




7\. Aspirated the supernatant.

8\. Resuspended pellet in   30  mL     Growth     media each

9\. Transfer cell suspension into new 1 x E125




10\. Transferred vessel(s) to incubate at:

  * [x]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (avian cells)
