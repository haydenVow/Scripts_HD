adhered to the base of the wells.

2\. Aliquot 9mL 'crocodile food' from fridge 104 and place in water bath.
NOTE: PLEASE REDUCE WATER BATH TEMPERATURE TO 28 DEGREES (37 degrees will kill
crocodile cells)  

3\. Check under microscope to check for contamination or attached cells.
Please image cells on 10x magnification if you see any adhered to the plate.  

4\. Remove 1.5mL media from each well, without removing tissue chunks.

5\. Gently topped up media by slowly adding 1.5mL GM to side of well, taking
care not to dislodge chunks from the bottom of the plate.
