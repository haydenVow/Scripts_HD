Reagent preparation:

Use the following spreadsheet to:

  * Determine the total amount of regent required for primary staining
  * Provide more information on antibody types

OR

  

Alternatively plug in your values and manually calculate: (note these volumes
are for primary and secondary staining + DAPI)

PBS:  10 x        (number of wells) x     mL  (volume per well) =    mL  

PBST (0.2% Triton-X) : 4 x       (number of wells) x     mL  (volume per well)
=    mL  

Blocking buffer:  3 x       (number of wells) x     mL  (volume per well) =
mL  

Note: blocking buffer is: PBST (0.1% Triton-X + PBS) + 3% bovine serum albumin
(BSA). Kept in the fridge until needed in blocking step

  

Prepared Primary Antibody Mix: :    µL   Primary #1 MyoG (Santa Cruz)   (1:200
) +    µL   Primary #2 MF20 (DSHB)   (1:50  ) +     mL Blocking Buffer

Pipette-mixed antibody mix and stored refrigerated away from light until
needed.

Process:

Fixing ( ~ 20 - 30 min)

  1.  Removed media from each well and wash with PBS. 
  2.  Added   µL PFA for 15 min:  : - : pm 
  3. Removed PFA (and add in PFA waste container) and wash wells with    µL PBS. 

  

Permeabilise ( ~ 20 - 30 min)

1\. Removed PBS from each well.

2\. Added   µL PBST (0.2% Triton-X) to each well for 15 min:  : - : pm

3\. Aspirated PBST for each well.




Blocking ( ~ 1 hr)

1\. Added    µL of blocking buffer (3% BSA in PBST [0.1% Triton-X]) and
incubate for 45 minutes - 1hr at RT. (no more than 1 hour):   : - : a/pm




Single/Simultaneous Primary Antibody staining ( ~ 10 minutes or 2hr)

1\. Removed blocking buffer from each well.

2\. Incubated cells with primary antibody for 90min - 2hrs at RT, or 4ºC
overnight:   : - : a/pm

3\. Parafilmed plates and stored at 4ºC in tissue culture lab Fridge.

After this step, all further task should be performed in a dark room. The
vessel should also be wrapped foil when not used.
