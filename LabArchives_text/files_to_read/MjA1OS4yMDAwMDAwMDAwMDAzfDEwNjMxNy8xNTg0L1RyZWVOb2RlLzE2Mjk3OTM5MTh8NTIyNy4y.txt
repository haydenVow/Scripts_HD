## Process

  1. Prepared 0.2M solution of GABA by adding 0.103 g in 5 mL PBS.
  2. Prepared 100mM glyoxylic acid solution by adding 0.092g in 10mL DMEM/F12.
  3. Prepared 1M hypoxanthine solution by adding 0.272g in 2mL of DMEM/F12.
  4. Made 180 mL of E8 (0.2xP/S) medium (do not filter yet) using E8 media calculator
  5. Opened E8_9C Media Calculator spreadsheet
  6. Prepared 1:100 dilution of ethanolamine
  7. Added ACF ingredients to E8 to make 180mL of E8_10C 
    1. E810C includes: 50uM Glyoxylic acid: used   90uL of 100mM stock
    2. E810C includes: 2mM hypoxanthine: used 360 uL of 1M stock
    3. 40uM GABA: 36 uL of 0.2M stock 
  8. Wrapped bottle with foil to protect from light  
  9. Labelled and stored in fridge.
