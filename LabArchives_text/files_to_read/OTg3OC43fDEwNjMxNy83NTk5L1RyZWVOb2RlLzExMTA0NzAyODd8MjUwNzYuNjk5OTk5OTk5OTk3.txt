18/11/21 Ellen placed an order for 10 x Label Free Quantitative Proteomics
analysis




16/111/2021 Chris O'Keefe dropped off 10 samples




22/11/21 Kyline sent the following sample details:  
  
 The samples that Chris dropped off earlier are the following:  
 \- P006 - Sheep myoblast  
 \- P007 - Sheep fibroblast grown on roller bottles  
 \- P008 - Sheep fibroblast grown on planar culture  
 \- P009 - Water Buffalo myoblast  
 \- P010 - Cow myoblast  
 \- P011 - Mouse myoblast  
 \- P012 - Crocodile fibroblast grown on planar culture  
 \- P013 - Crocodile fibroblast grown on roller bottles  
 \- P014 - Store bought Impossible patty for alternative protein comparison  
 \- P015 - Store bought Crocodile tail fillet tissue

All the samples have been washed with cold dPBS. We removed as much of the
dPBS as possible, but I suspect that the pellets still retain some of it. The
weight varies per tube, but are within the range of 30mg - 120 mg, which
should be enough for analysis.

Water buffalo (Bubalus bubalis) has 2321 sequences in Uniprot.

Shashikumar etal Theriogenology 110 p52-60 2018 used a IPI Bovine database
(IPI has closed down).

Brito etal Reprod in Dom Animals 2018 used the B. bubalis RefSeq Assembly
(Accession Number: GCF_000471725.1) > the NCBI page is here which has 72,808
sequences for tax id 89462.

There are 10 genomes:

The NCBI Release 102 protein FASTA file was downloaded and set up on the
Mascot server.

Saltwater crocodiles (Crocodylus porosus) are the predominant species that are
farmed so it was assumed that all the crocodile samples were from salties.  

 The CroPor_comp1 protein sequences were downloaded and set up on the Mascot
server.

The Impossible patty is mainly soy based according to the Gille'd website.

100uL of each sample was taken out and centrifuged at 20,000g for 30min @4degC

Supernatant was taken (avoiding fatty layer at top) and 100uL MilliQwater was
added and vortexed

Proteins were precipitated using a chloroform/methanol cleanup protocol, r/c
in 100uL lysis buffer and quantified using Qubit

Samples were normalised to ~100ug/100uL, reduced with 10mM DTT, alkylated with
25mM IAA, diluted 1 in 5 with HEPES buffer (50mM, pH 7.8) and 2ug trypsin was
added.  Sample were digested o/N at 37degC in a thermomixer.

  

24/11/2021

Samples were acidified by adding 100% TFA to a concentration of 1% TFA,
centrifuged at  16000g for 5 min and  supernatant collected.

Samples were then cleaned up using HLB cartridges, eluted in 500uL 50% ACN,
0.1% TFA and dried down overnight

25/11/2021

Samples were reconstituted in 30uL water and a qubit quantification was done
(see table above)

Samples were diluted so that  ~1ug/3uL was loaded onto the HFX3

Samples were run in triplicate

One of the Impossible patty samples (14_1) was researched, this time against
soy and the whole of SwissProt:

The search his 18,854 proteins, 2694 (up from 2530) protein groups, 13,146
peptide groups, 30,847 PSM from 150,092 MSMS.

To double check the Swissprot bovine database, samples 10_1 and 14_1 were
researched against the NCBI bovine reference proteome.

At the request of Chris from Vow Foods, the soy samples searches were repeated
using this RefSeq database:

  

When loaded in to PD, the RefSeq is smaller than the Uniprot DB:

When generating the mascot reports it was noticed that PD had split the mascot
search over multiple (usually 4) separate search's before compiling the
results.  So there isn't a mascot report corresponding to each of the
triplicate searches.  To get around this the 3 .raw files for each sample were
converted to 1 .mgf file and searched directly in mascot.
