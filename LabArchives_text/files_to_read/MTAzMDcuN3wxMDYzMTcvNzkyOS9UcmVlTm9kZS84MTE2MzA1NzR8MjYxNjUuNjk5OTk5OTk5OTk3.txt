Aim/Purpose


To obtain chicken chondrocytes for integration with alginate strands as an
analogue for shark fin soup


Hypothesis


We hypothesise that cells integrated inside the alginate strands have a
different texture to plain alginate strands.


Technical Gap -


Currently, we do not know if the cells have a beneficial attribute to the
alginate strands. We want to understand if textural behaviour of the cells in
the alginate strands is present with an immediate integration.


Method/Procedure


  1. Planning and set up Experiment
  2. Biopsy and Isolation briefing 
  3. Biopsy 
  4. Isolation
  5. Harvest
  6. Tasting immediately after harvest
  7. Seed onto alginate strands
  8. The seed inside alginate strands 
  9. Tasting 48 hours after harvest
