Procedure

Media Bottle Change:

  1. Switch off to stop the pump.
  2. Press "Stop" to stop the CelCradle Stage operation.
  3. Remove CelCradle-500AP from the CelCradle Stage and remove pump head from CelFeeder.
  4. Move the whole set into a BSC.
  5. Move the head plate to a new vessel with fresh culture medium. Tightly cap the head plate.
  6. Move the whole set back into the incubator and mount CelCradle-500AP on CelCradle Stage, then mount pump head onto CelFeeder.
  7. Re-start CelCradle Stage and CelFeeder.

  
Due to the low pH measured yesterday the media was changed to fresh media
today.  
Due to my clean autoclaved Schott bottles accidently being mistaken as waste
bottles, I was not able to used a new bottle to change the media. Instead the
media was poured out of the existing bottle and fresh media was poured in.  
  
Media ID: A11179  

  




Observations:

Some aggregates were observed in the bottom of the CelCradle-500AP bottle (see
images below). This is likely to be either from cells that did not attach
during seeding, or cells that have detached over time and accumulated at the
bottom of the bottle.
