## Performed by: Bonnie




Note

Given the confluence of these cultures when passaged, the counts were very low
compared to other cell lines. The cells also appear larger however, and had
very long cell projections. The SILKIEK culture was very clumpy and it was
difficult to break up the clumps with pipetting.  




Process:

  1. Observed cultures under the microscope, SILKIEO and SILKIEK cultures were approximately 90% confluent with largely fibroblastic morphologies. SILKIEF was over confluent.
  2. Aliquoted reagents and placed in the cell culture incubator to warm >45 minutes prior to use: TrypLE:    20 ,Growth media (for pellet resuspension):    100   mL of each media
  3. Removed media from flasks 
  4. Washed with 10mL PBS to wash 
  5. Added 5mL Tryple to each flask and incubated at 37C for 10min 
  6. Added 5mL PBS to each flask, then transferred the mix to 50mL centrifuge tubes
  7. Centrifuged for 5 min at approx 500g. 
  8. Removed supernatant and resuspended cell pellets in 5mL of their respective growth media.
  9. Took 40ul aliquots from each tube to perform cell counts.
  10. Performed trypan blue counts for each culture and recoded in the cell count spreadsheet

CELL COUNTS  
SILKIEO- 2.05M  
SILKIEK- 4.05M  
SILKIEF- 5.7M

  11. Reseeded SILKIEO AND SILKIEK into 2x T175s and SILKIEF into 1x T175 flasks, in 30mL per flask of their respective medias.
