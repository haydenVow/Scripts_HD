AIM/PURPOSE: Determine if the type of water (MilliQ [Type 1 water] vs bottled
ultrapure vs RO [type 3 water]) used to reconstitute the Hycell CHO media
affects the survival and subsequent proliferation of Nuvonis suspension cells

HYPOTHESIS: No significant differences in Nuvonis survival and proliferation
will be observed between Hycell media reconstituted in each of the water
treatment conditions.

RESULTS SUMMARY:

See final report

CONCLUSIONS:

Nuvonis quail fibroblasts were able to survive and proliferate in 3 of the
water types testing, including ID, RO and tap. Unfortunately cells grown in
growth medium reconstituted in UD water exhibited either very little growth or
mass cell death. Cells grown in MilliQ had the highest total cell numbers and
the lowest doubling times, followed by tap, ID, RO and finally UD.

NEXT STEPS:

  * Repeat with sufficient technical replicates (n â‰¥ 3) for statistical analysis to determine the performance of different water types relative to the control conditions.
