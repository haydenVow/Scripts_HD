## Feed performed by: Bec Screnci  




Growth Media:

  * [X ]  DMEM/F12 + 20% FBS + 1X P/S
  * [X ]  DMEM/F12 + 20% FBS + 1X P/S + 1:100 Anti-clumping agent
  * [X ]  DMEM/F12 + 20% FBS + 1X P/S + 1:500 Anti-clumping agent
  * [X ]  DMEM/F12 + 20% FBS + 1X P/S + 1:100 RevitaCell




Process:

1\. Place the pre-aliquotted  10 mL  mL of each respective type of Growth
Media into the water bath  13:39 pm

2\. Placed shake tubes in centrifuge and centrifuge at 650 x g for 5 min at
RT.   13:58 - 14:03 pm

Aspirated supernatant from each pellet

Note* RevitaCell pellet was dislodged so re-centrifuged  14:20 - 14:25 pm

Added 1mL of respective growth media to each tube and used a P1000 pipette to
break up cell clumps.

10uL of each culture taken for viability check

Remaining 9mL of each respective media was added afterwards and triturated
with 10mL serological pipette to break up cell clumps for each culture further
and resuspend cells evenly.

4\. Returned 3 x vessel to incubate at:   14:22 pm Shaking at 206 RPM  
RevitaCell transferred to incubator 14:29 pm

  * [X ]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (aviary cells)

Observations:

Upon collecting the tubes from the shaking platform, tubes were observed.

1:100 anti-clumping - supernatant is cloudy with cells, and contains 5-6
clumps of cells, all small (no large aggregate)

1:500 anti-clumping - supernatant is cloudy with cells, and contains and one
medium & one small irregular shaped clump

1:100 RevitaCell - supernatant is cloudy with cells, and contains and one
medium irregular shaped clump

Serum control - supernatant has some cells when looked at closely, and one
large irregular shaped clump

 100  % media changed on vessel(s)

### Results

  * Results were;
    * [ ]  As Usual (this is a repetitive task)
    * [ ]  Unexpected because...
    * [ X]  Need to be further analysed (this will be graphed along with continual viability and cell count measurements over the course of the experiment to plot cell survival
    * [ ]  Other (.......)
