Process:

1\. Aliquotted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then
placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath for a minimum of 20 minutes
prior to use:

  1. TrypLE:   40    mL.
  2. dPBS (for neutralising)   40  mL.
  3. OptiPro media: 10 mL




2\. Washed the flask(s) with dPBS.

3\. Added   10    mL tryple to each vessel/well and incubated at 37ËšC for   10
min.

Start/Finish time for centrifugation was    3:05    \-    3:15   pm

4\. Neutralised with    10   dPBS (warmed) and combined cell suspension into 2
x    50 mL   tube.

5. Centrifuged at 650 x g for 5 min. Aspirated supernatant.

6\. Resuspended cell pellet in 10 mL growth medium and performed count on
heamocytometer.

7\. Total count was 5,960,000 cells. This was recorded on the cell count
spreadsheet.

8\. Centrifuged at 650 x g for 5 min.

9\. Aspirated supernatant and resuspended cell pellet in 6 mL cryostor.

10\. Dispensed 1 mL of cell suspension into each cryovial to freeze down at 1M
cells/mL.
