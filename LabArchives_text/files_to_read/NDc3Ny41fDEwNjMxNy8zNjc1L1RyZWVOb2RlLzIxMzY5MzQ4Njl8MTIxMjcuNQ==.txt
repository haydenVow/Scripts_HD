Process:

  1. Checked C2C12 plate under microscope to observe confluency, if wells are confluent enough for differentiate - then aliquot 1.5mL of E6 and proceed with feed. If not, aliquot and feed with Growth Media (+ p38i). DOLLY plate to be fed with E6 as normal.
  2. Placed media aliquot/s in water bath   10:33 a/pm 
  3. Removed  100  % of supernatant from vessel. 
  4. Replaced with  140uL  (per well/per vessel) of   E6/GM  media. 
  5. Returned vessel to incubate at: 12:23

  * [x]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (aviary cells)

  

  * Incubator (#  ), Lab [Main/Library/Production]




### Observations/Summary:

 100 % media changed on vessel(s)

  1. C2C12 not confluuent enough yet. fed with GM. See images
