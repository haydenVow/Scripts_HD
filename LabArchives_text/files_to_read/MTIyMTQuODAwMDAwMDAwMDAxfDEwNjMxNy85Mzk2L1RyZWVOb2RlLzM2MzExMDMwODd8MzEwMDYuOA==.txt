Briefly

  1. Culture media was removed from the clone. 
  2. 1mL of dpBS was added to wash the cells 
  3. dPBS was removed and cells were then treated with 2mL of TRYPLE-EDTA
  4. Cells were incubated at 30 degrees for 10 minutes to detach cells
  5. Cells were removed from incubation, mixed by pipetting. then all of the Tryple volume was taken and added to a 15mL tubes.
  6. Flask was then washed with 2mL of dPBS
  7. DPBS wash was collected and added to the same tube containing cells. 
  8. Cells were centrifuged at 650g for 5 minutes. 
  9. Supernatant was removed and cells were resuspended in 12 mL of DMEM/F12 + 20% FBS + 1xP/S growth media. 
  10. Cells were transferred to a new T75 flask
  11. Flasks were returned to incubate at 30 degrees, 5% CO2. incubator 140.
