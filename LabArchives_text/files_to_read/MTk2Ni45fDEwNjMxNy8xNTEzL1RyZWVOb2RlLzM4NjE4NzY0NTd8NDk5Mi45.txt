Background


See Background Section as well as the Background Section written for Trial #2
of fibroblasts in suspension culture.


Aim


To identify media composition that will allow primary fibroblasts to adapt to
suspension culture in 50mL shake tubes and promote proliferation.


Hypothesis


That screening 4 more media components will allow us to assess their effect on
cell survival and proliferation in suspension culture of primary fibroblasts.


Methods


1\. Prepare 50mL of each Growth Media:

\- DMEM/F12 + 20% FBS + 1X P/S (Serum Control)

\- DMEM/F12 + 20% FBS + 1X P/S + ROCK Inhibitor (Y27632, 10µM)

\- DMEM/F12 + 20% FBS + 1X P/S + ROCK Inhibitor (Y27632, 20µM)

\- DMEM/F12 + 20% FBS + 1X P/S + Pluronic F-68 (Poloxamer 188) 0.1% w/v

\- DMEM/F12 + 20% FBS + 1X P/S + Pluronic F-68 (Poloxamer 188) 0.2% w/v

\- DMEM/F12 + 20% FBS + 1X P/S + RDG Peptide (0.01mM)

\- DMEM/F12 + 20% FBS + 1X P/S + RDG Peptide (0.1mM)

\- DMEM/F12 + 20% FBS + 1X P/S + RDG Peptide (1mM)  

\- DMEM/F12 + 20% FBS + 1X P/S + YIGSR (0.1-100µM)  
2.1 pmol/cm2 used for adherent so something similar?) = 3000pmol for 10M cells
(if 2.1pmol/cm2 and 7,000 cells / cm2 = 2.1pmol / 7,000 cells) = 0.000003 mM
or 0.003 µM

\- DMEM/F12 + 20% FBS + 1X P/S + YIGSR (10µM)

\- DMEM/F12 + 20% FBS + 1X P/S + YIGSR (100µM)

\- DMEM/F12 + 20% FBS + 1X P/S + 1:100 RevitaCell

  

  

  

ROCK

Pluronic

RevitaCell

Serum Ctrl x 3 (1 control, 2 for RGD/YIGSR when it arrives)

  




Note* Due to delay in RGD and YIGSR peptide delivery, 4 conditions will go
ahead:

\- Serum control (high cell density)

\- Serum control (low cell density)

\- ROCK inhibitor 10µM

\- Pluronic F-68 (Poloxamer 188) 0.1% w/v

  

  




  1. Prepare 500mL of Growth Media
  2. Aliquot 2 x 50mL for the serum control conditions
  3. Aliquot 49.95mL Growth Media + 50µL ROCK inhibitor (Mix ID #2224 10mM Y-27632)
  4. Aliquot 49.5mL Growth Media + 500µL Poloxamer (Aliquot ID #4915 10% W/V Poloxamer 188)

Seeding Day:

  1. Harvest DOLLY12 fibroblasts from 5CF and perform cell count
  2. Aliquot 8.5M cells into 3 x 50mL shake tubes, and 34M cells into 1 x 50mL shake tube.
  3. Centrifuge at 650 x g for 5 min at RT.
  4. Aspirate supernatant carefully
  5. Resuspend each pellet in 1mL of the respective Growth Media with a P1000 to break up the cells
  6. Add the remaining 9mL of respective Growth Media with a 10mL serological pipette to disperse cells evenly throughout the suspension
  7. Transfer tubes to shake at 206 RPM at 37ºC, 5% CO2.

Every 2 days: (week-day)

  1. Aliquot 10mL of each growth media required for the 100% feed (20mL of serum-based Growth Media and 10mL of each ROCK / Pluronic -supplemented media).
  2. Warm at 37ºC for at least 15 mins.
  3. Collect the 50mL shake tubes and observe the suspensions.  
Note cloudiness, any clumps, sediment, other observations

  4. Centrifuge 50mL shake tubes at 650 x g for 5 min at RT.
  5. Transfer tubes to the BSC.
  6. Aspirate supernatant from each pellet.
  7. Resuspend each pellet in 1mL of respective Growth Media with a P1000 to break up the cells (triturate 10-20 times)
  8. Collect 1 x 10µL aliquot for cell counting (unless new counting method is developed).
  9. Add the remaining 9mL of respective Growth Media with a 10mL serological pipette to disperse cells evenly throughout the suspension.
  10. Return shake tubes back to shake at 206 RPM at 37ºC, 5% CO2.
  11. Perform a 1:1 trypan blue dilution on the cell count and visualise under a hemocytometer. Count live and dead cells for each grid, and add details to this counting spreadsheet https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1DPzKubYxfHmWogVPihC-SSIBtIylyrBQE5kRX5Z8NtI/edit#gid=124392711
