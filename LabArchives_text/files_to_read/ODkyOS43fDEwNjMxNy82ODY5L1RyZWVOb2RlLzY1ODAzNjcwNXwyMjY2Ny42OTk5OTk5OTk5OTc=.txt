### Process:

1\. Took image of vessel with microscope on phase setting.

3\. Aliquotted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then
placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath for a minimum of 20 minutes
prior to use:

  1. TrypLE:    1500     mL in   3x 500mL bottles     
  2.  dPBS (for neutralising):     1500   mL
  3.  dPBS (for washing):      1500   mL
  4. Growth media (for pellet resuspension):         mL
  5. Growth media (for seeding):    18L   mL 

Time that all aliquots were placed in the water bath the warm before use
13:35 pm  

Note: if aliquots were placed in water bath at different time, record the time
stamp for each individual solution.




Flask 1of3

4\. Removed vessel(s) from the incubator    14:+30   a/pm

5\. Washed the vessel(s) with dPBS (warmed) (500mL).

6\. Added     500    mL tryple to each vessel/well and incubated at 37˚C.

  1. Start/Finish for TrypLE was     14:34 - 14:55 pm 

7\. Neutralised with    500 mL      dPBS and combined cell suspension into a
250 mL      tube.

8\. Centrifuged at 650 x g for 5 min.

  1. Start/Finish time for centrifugation was     15:10pm 

  

Flask 2of3

Flask 3of3

4\. Removed vessel(s) from the incubator     14:42 pm

5\. Washed the vessel(s) with dPBS (warmed) (500mL).

6\. Added     500    mL tryple to each vessel/well and incubated at 37˚C.

  1. Start/Finish for TrypLE was    14:45 pm 

7\. Neutralised with    500 mL      dPBS and combined cell suspension into a
250 mL       tube.

8\. Centrifuged at 650 x g for 5 min.

  1. Start/Finish time for centrifugation was    15:28 pm 




9\. Aspirated the supernatant(s).

10\. Resuspended pellet(s) in    83.5 mL    PRF DMEM/F12 20% FBS      media
15:30 pm

11\. Aliquoted    2x 100 uL   of resuspended cells into a microcentrifuge tube
for cell count.

12\. Performed a cell count using the haemocytometer and recorded the cell
count data in the Google Doc spreadsheet: Cell Count Spreadsheet or cell count
widget below

  1. Total cell number was:    889,644,000       
  2. Volume of cell suspension required for subculture was:      853,200,000     
  3. Cell density per vessel:   11500 cells/cm2
  4. Cell suspension per 10CS (1.5L) = 6.65 mL @15,000 cells/cm2  

  5. Cell suspension per 5CS (.75L) = 3.325 mL @15,000 cells/cm2  

  6. Vitamin C per 10CS (for CHOMP method flasks) = 750 uL per 1.5 L media (375 uL per 750 mL media) of a 100mg/mL stock




 13\. Transferred      below   µl of cell suspension to the pre-warmed
750mL (per 5CS) and 1.5L (per 10CS)   mL Growth media:      19:20 pm

Seeded 4 x 10CS + 1 x 5CS WITH VITAMIN C

Seeded 4 x 10CS + 1 x 5CS WITHOUT VITAMIN C

16\. Transferred vessel(s) to incubate at:

  * [X ]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells) in the library lab
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (avian cells)
