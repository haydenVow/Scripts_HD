Aim


To investigate the effect of CO2 independent media on myoblast proliferation
and differentiation


Hypothesis


CO2 independent media (L-15) will support the proliferation and
differentiation of BUFFY6 myoblasts on par with CO2 dependent media (DMEM).


Background


In order to satisfy energy requirements during cell proliferation and
differentiation, cultures are maintained with various culture media
formulations. For certain medium, the basal media often contains sodium bi-
carbonate as a mild buffer system to maintain culture pH. Moreover, these
cultures are kept in 4-10% CO2 as a requirement for this buffer system. Using
CO2-independant media such as Leibovitz L-15 would allow our cultures to be
incubated without a constant CO2 supply. Should such media prove to provide
similar proliferation rates and differentiation potential as our CO2 dependant
basal medium, there are clear implications about the cost reduction of
maintaining our cultures. This experiment investigates the performance of CO2
independent L-15 medium in comparison to the currently used DMEM/F12 (CO2
dependent basal media) in regards to BUFFY6 myoblast proliferation and
differentiation.
