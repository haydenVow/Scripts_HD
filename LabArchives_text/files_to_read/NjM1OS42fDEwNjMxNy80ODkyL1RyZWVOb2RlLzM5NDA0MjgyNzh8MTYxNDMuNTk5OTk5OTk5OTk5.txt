## Image flask

  1. Observed flask under the microscope at 4x or 5x objective for even cell distribution and < 50% confluency. Refer to VSOP006_0
  2. Took at least 3 images per flask and returned flask back to incubator.

  




## Harvest

  1. Transfer flask and aliquots into BSC, ensuring to wipe down containers with 70% EtOH during the transfer.   
  2. Discarded growth media from each flask 
  3. Washed with warmed dPBS, then discarded. (for cell factory equalised and gently swirled flask

  




  1. Added TrypLE to each of the flasks. Swirled flask thoroughly to ensure coverage of the surface area.
  2. Placed in the incubator at 37C.
  3. After 5 minutes, swirled flask again to ensure all surfaces are covered.
  4. After 10 minute, removed flasks and observed for 95-100% dissociation of cells. Incubated further if needed until maximum dissociation level is reached.
    1. Flask 1 `Time stamp`:
    2. Flask 2 `Time stamp`:
    3. Flask 3 `Time stamp`:

  




  1. Collected TrypLE solution into 225mL centrifuge tubes
  2. Wash flask with ambient temperature dPBS and transferred into centrifuge tube. 
  3. Centrifuged at 650 x g for 5 minutes. 
    1. `Start time stamp` :
    2. `End time stamp` :

  




  1. Freeze cells 
    1. Weigh 6 x 15 mL tubes and record weight 
    2. Remove supernatant and wash cells with additional ice cold PBS and divide into the 6 x 15 mL tubes - 3 containing 2/3 of the cells and the other 3 containing 1/3 of cells. 
    3. Centrifuge tubes and remove as much of the supernatant 
    4. Weight tunes containing cell pellet and record the pellet weight on the tube. Label as: cell line myoblast, weight of cells and the number of tube 
    5. Place samples in the - 80 freezer in main lab.

Handling cell factories:  

For cell factories, majority of steps involving removing or adding large
amount of media will be performed by carefully pouring liquid in or out of the
cell factory.

Quick tips:

  * Both caps on the cell factory need to be removed when adding and removing liquid. This prevents the liquid for gurgling and forming bubbles. (vid: 2:16 - 2:44)
  * Avoid touching the waste bottle with the cell factory opening. (sterile urine waste containers are easier to pour into)
  * After adding liquid into the cell factory, make sure to equalise it. To equalise, return lids to cell factory and place it on its side (blue lid at the bottom side). Allow liquid to equalise before lifting it to an upright position. (vid: 0.51- 1:16)
  * When transferring 4CF into the BSC, wipe down with ethanol sprayed ready wipe.
  * Any accidental spills on the BSC should be wiped up with an ethanol sprayed ready wipe.
  * Any spills on the cell factory and the slides of the opening should be wiped up with a ethanol sprayed kimwipe. (never wipe the top of the cell factory opening)
  * If a lid of the cell factory is compromised (dropped or an object passes over it) use a replacement lid (replacements can be found in the lab draws)
