RELATED TO OKR:  NON KR

AIM/PURPOSE The overarching goal is to expand the Vows existing cell library
to include a broader range of species. Here, we aim to isolate a plastic
adherent population of cells from wallaby muscle tissue (which we will refer
to as WALLE cells). These cells will then be expanded to form a master cell
bank (MCB) and working cell bank (WCB).

HYPOTHESIS

  1. 12 Vials of WALLE crude homogenate will be frozen down following Vows established protocols for cell isolation.
  2. Plastic adherent populations of cells will be established via immediate culture of WALLE crude homogenate. 
  3. The plastic adherent population of WALLE cells will be expanded in culture to an MCB of ≥ 15M cells. 

RESULTS SUMMARY

  1. 12 Vials of WALLE crude homogenate were frozen down from 4 biopsies, following Vows established protocols for cell isolation.
  2. Plastic adherent populations of cells were established via immediate culture of WALLE06, WALLE07, WALLE08 and WALLE09  crude homogenate, and were first observed after 6-7 days in culture. 
  3. We were unable to expand and of our cell lines to an MCB of ≥ 15M cells. This was due to extremely slow cell proliferation.
  4. Last ditch efforts to kick-start p5 WALLE06 proliferation via seeding cells into media containing a higher proportion of FBS, into conditioned media, or by seeding at a higher cell density were all unsuccessful.
  5. Stunted proliferation resulted in WALLE08 being terminated after 14 days, WALLE07 being terminated after 50 days, and WALLE06 + WALLE09 being terminated after 53 days in culture.

CONCLUSIONS  
We have now made multiple attempts to establish MCBs of plastic adherent cell
lines derived from Bennet's Wallaby muscle tissue. We have been unsuccessful
in each attempt, largely due to the slow proliferation of the cells.  
  
NEXT STEPS  
For the foreseeable future, Vow will not further pursue the addition of
Bennet's Wallaby cells to our cell library. It is possible that the
optimisation of media, passaging and culture conditions would improve the
proliferative capacity of these cells. We are currently focusing our resources
in other areas, however if our priorities change in future, frozen WALLE
isolate may be thawed, and culture optimisations performed.
