Only two flasks out of 7 had visible aggregates

Flask 6559 had very obvious aggregates. It looks like a film of cells peeling

Flask 6559





Flask 6556 had very small aggregates only near the neck of the flask.

  

Flask 6556 is the flask on top. Aggregates near neck of the flask are harder
to see but look in the area with a dark background
