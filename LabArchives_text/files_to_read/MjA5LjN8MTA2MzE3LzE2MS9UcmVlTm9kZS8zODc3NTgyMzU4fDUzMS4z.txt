Equilibrate microcarriers in culture medium before use

  1. Prior to use, 270mg of sterilized microcarriers (conc 20g/L) were aliquoted into an E250 vessel (13.5mL).
  2. The microcarriers were rinsed in warm culture medium (20-50 mL/g Cytodex, 13.5mL). this rinse reduces dilution of the culture medium by PBS trapped between and within the microcarriers, which is particularly important when using small culture volumes or cells with low plating efficiencies. 
  3. The microcarriers were then allowed to settle and 18mL of supernatant was removed and discarded. 
  4. The microcarriers were resuspended to 60mL in the desired volume of culture medium. 
  5. The culture vessel was transferred to the incubator for at least 1 hour so that the microcarriers and culture medium could equilibrate at 37 degrees 5% Co2. Incubated at 12:06, incubator #78
