1.Performed 2x trypan blue cell counts.  
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1DPzKubYxfHmWogVPihC-
SSIBtIylyrBQE5kRX5Z8NtI/edit#gid=0  
Average =666,165,000  
3M cells will be taken for use by Alex  
9M cells will be taken for use by Adrian  
15M cells will be taken and expanded to form a second WCB by Victoria.

This leaves 583,776,000 cells to be banked. At 7.5M cells/vial, this will
equate to 77.8 vials, 76 vials will be prepared (to account for loss via
pipetting error)  
6 vials of 7.5M cells per vial will be banked as MCB vials, and the remaining
70 vials will be frozen as a WCB.  

4.Prepare room temperature CRM and 2xCFM. For each vial to be filled 0.5 ml
CRM and 0.5 ml 2xCFM is needed.  
CRM= Nuvonis suspension media without ACA- 40mL prepared Note that we
accidentally included ACA  
2x CFM= CRM with 15% DMSO.

5.Transfer  the  required  culture  volume  from  the  shaker flask  into   3x
200ml  centrifuge tubes and centrifuge cells at 310g for 10 min.

7.Dilute cells to 1.5E07 cells/ml in CRM.

8.Dilute  cell  suspension  1:1  with  2xCFM  (final  cell  density:  7.5M/ml;
final  DMSO concentration: 7.5% (v/v))

9.Homogenise cell suspension by gentle pipetting and aliquot into cryo vials
(1 ml/vial)  
Lot 1: 13998-14023- aliquots performed by: Adrian  
Lot 2: 14023-14047- aliquots performed by: Victoria  
Lot3 : 14048-14072- aliquots performed by: Bonnie

10.Transferred cryovials into room temperature Mr. Frosty cell freezing
containers, and moved to library lab -80 freezer 64.
