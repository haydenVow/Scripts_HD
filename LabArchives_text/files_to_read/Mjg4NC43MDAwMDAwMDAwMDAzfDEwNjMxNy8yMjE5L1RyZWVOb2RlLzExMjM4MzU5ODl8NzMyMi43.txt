NOTE: Please check Daisy fibroblasts and take a few photos on 10x
magnification. I was trying to expand them to a MCB but they have been very
slow growing. On Friday they were looking like they were senescing, with
vacuoles in their cytoplasm.  If they still do not look healthy today, we may
need to chuck them. If they are healthy, please bank as MCB.

  

Cells appear to have further senesced and not grown since Friday based on
microscope images (see below), so cells were discarded (LL)
