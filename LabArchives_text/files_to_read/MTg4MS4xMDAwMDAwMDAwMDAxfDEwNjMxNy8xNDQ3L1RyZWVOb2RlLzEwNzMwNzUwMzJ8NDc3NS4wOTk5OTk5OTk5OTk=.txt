Growth Media:

  * [x ]  DMEM/F12 + 20% FBS + 1X P/S + P38i (10uM)




### Process:

1\. Took image of vessel with microscope on phase setting.

2\.  

  1. Time when all vessels(s) placed into the incubator       09:25   

3\. Aliquotted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then
placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath for a minimum of 20 minutes
prior to use:

  1. TrypLE:    100     mL in       1  tub
  2.  dPBS (for washing and neutralising):    100     mL in      1  tub
  3. dPBS (for neutralising):    100     mL in      1  tub
  4. Growth media (for pellet resuspension):   10   mL in    1     tub
  5. Growth media (for seeding):  1.5  L in       3  tubes

Time that all aliquots were placed in the water bath the warm before use
13:50

Note: if aliquots were placed in water bath at different time, record the time
stamp for each individual solution.




4\. Removed vessel(s) from the incubator     16:45

5\. Washed the vessel(s) with dPBS (warmed).

6\. Added     100    mL tryple to each vessel/well and incubated at 37˚C.

  1. Start/Finish for TrypLE was    15:55- 17:05 

7\. Neutralised with    100ml      dPBS and combined cell suspension into
4x 50mL   tube.

8\. Centrifuged at 650 x g for 5 min.

  1. Start/Finish time for centrifugation was     17:10-17-15 




9\. Aspirated the supernatant(s).

10\. Resuspended pellet(s) in    6.5     mL       growth   media     17:20

11\. Aliquoted     2x50ul     of resuspended cells into a microcentrifuge tube
for cell count.

12\. Performed a cell count using the haemocytometer and recorded the cell
count data in the Google Doc spreadsheet called 'Cell Count Spreadsheet' (see
link below):

SSIBtIylyrBQE5kRX5Z8NtI/edit#gid=0

  1.  Total cell number was:      5,600,000       

  2. Volume of cell suspension required for subculture was:       all      

  3. Cell density per vessel:    5,600,000/10CS        




13\. Transferred   6.5        µl of cell suspension to the pre-warmed
1.5    L Growth media:    17:45  

14\. Transferred cell suspension into the pre-gelatin coated     10SC
vessel.

15\. Left at RT in the BSC for 30 min to allow cells to settle     17:55  

16\. Transferred vessel(s) to incubate at: 18:20

  * [ x]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (avian cells)
