This 2nd cell expansion of C2C12s was performed due to the premature death of
several cultures derived from the WBC previously banked (see lab book summary
here:https://au-
mynotebook.labarchives.com/share/Vow%2520-%2520Team%2520Science/MjQxNC4xfDEwNjMxNy8xODU3LTEyNzc2L1RyZWVOb2RlLzg4NjE2MjU4NXw2MTI4LjA5OTk5OTk5OTk5OQ==).

The expansion to a 2nd WCB was successful, with a final bank of 80 million,
apparently healthy cells.

It is unclear why C2C12 cells thawed from the 1st WCB died unexpectedly. We
have also recently experienced death of our MOCHA cells as well as DOLLY
fibroblasts. The issue may be due to possible malfunction/ or improper
maintenance of the Thermo Incubator in main lab. This will be investigated
further.

Another possible reason for reduced viability of cells was the addition of P38
inhibitor (used prior to 1st WCB and by the science team after thawing these
vials). P38 inhibitor is not traditionally used in C2C12 cell culture. As it
is not required to prevent differentiation in these cells, it will be omitted
from future C2C12 cultures.

For the initial WCB expansion, culture flasks were coated with 1% gelatin
prior to cells seeding. As C2C12s are plastic adherent and vessel coating is
not required, this step was omitted from our second expansion. It is possible
that is also have an affect on cell viability. Gelatin coating of flasks will
not be performed when working with C2C12s in future.
