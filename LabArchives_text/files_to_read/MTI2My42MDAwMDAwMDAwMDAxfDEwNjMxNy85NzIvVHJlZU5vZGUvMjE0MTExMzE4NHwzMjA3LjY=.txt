  * [ ]  DMEM + 10% HS + 1X P/S
  * [ ]  DMEM + 10% HS + 1X P/S + 25ng/mL FGF-basic + P38i (10uM)
  * [ ]  DMEM + 10% HS + 1X P/S + 25ng/mL FGF-basic
  * [ ]  DMEM + 10% HS + 1X P/S + P38i (10uM)
  * [ ]  DMEM + 10% FBS + 1X P/S
  * [ ]  DMEM + 20% FBS + 1X P/S
  * [ ]  DMEM/F12 + 10% FBS + 1X P/S
  * [ ]  DMEM/F12 + 20% FBS + 1X P/S
  * [ ]  DMEM/F12 + 20% FBS + 1X P/S + 25ng/mL FGF-basic
  * [x]  DMEM/F12 + 20% FBS + 1X P/S + P38i (10uM)
  * [ ]  DMEM/F12 + 20% FBS + 1X P/S + 25ng/mL FGF-basic + P38i (10uM)

Total media required: 750mL

Total p38i required: 375uL




Reagent preperation

1\. Removed   750mL  mL of  Growth Media in  2x 500   mL bottles from the cell
expansion fridge. Placed in water bath   10:20 am




## 10CS Process

2\. Removed  50  % of supernatant from vessel.

3\. Replaced with  750mL (per well/per vessel) of  growth   media.

4\. Returned vessel to incubate at: 11:14am

  * [x]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (aviary cells)

  

  * [x]  Thermo Incubator (ID #13)
  * [ ]  Top Sanyo Incubator (ID #25)
  * [ ]  Bottom Sanyo Incubator
  * [ ]  Top Binder Incubator
  * [ ]  Bottom Binder Incubator

  




Cell factory Process

  1. Unscrew white cap and remove blue cap and place aside.
  2. Removed  `50`  % of supernatant (300 mL) from 1 x 10CS by carefully pouring into a waste container with 750mL marked.
  3. Replaced with  `750` mL (per flask) of  `growth`   media by carefully pouring media through the white cap opening (alternatively you may use a 50mL serological to add media.)
  4. Place caps back and equalise 10CS by placing it on its side (blue cap on the bottom and white cap on the top, see image below:)  
  

4\. Returned vessel to incubate at:

  * [x]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (aviary cells)

  

  * [x]  Thermo Incubator (ID #13)
  * [ ]  Top Sanyo Incubator (ID #25)
  * [ ]  Bottom Sanyo Incubator
  * [ ]  Top Binder Incubator
  * [ ]  Bottom Binder Incubator
