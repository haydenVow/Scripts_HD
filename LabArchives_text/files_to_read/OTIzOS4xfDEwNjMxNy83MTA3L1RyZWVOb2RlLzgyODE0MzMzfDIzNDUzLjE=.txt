Passage

  1.  ~~Calculated required media for new E125 flask with required media for 50 000 cells/mL in 30mL final volume (made up of old cell suspension and new media). Used seeder widget to calculate required volume of cell suspension~~
    *  ~~Required cell suspension:        ~~
    *  ~~Required new medium:         ~~
  2.  ~~Added required growth factors to media, calculated fromMedia Calculator~~
    *  ~~+EGF:         ~~
    *  ~~+IGF:         ~~
  3.  ~~Incubated media at    37   °C for       minutes~~
  4.  ~~Removed vessel from incubator and performed media change/passage: <indicate which here by strikeout>~~
    *  ~~added newly prepared media and added cell suspension drop-wise~~
    *  ~~Returned vessel to shaking incubation at 37 °C~~ ~~~~

Observations:

  * Last count could be an anomaly - found to be considerably lower than the first two counts.
  * Average live cell count is in the range of 161K-196K cells/mL
