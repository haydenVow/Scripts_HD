1\. Prepared  2 mL  PBST (0.2% Triton-X)

2\. Prepared  2 mL  blocking buffer: PBST (0.1% Triton-X + PBS) + 3% bovine
serum albumin (BSA). (Kept in the fridge until needed in blocking step)

3\. Prepared Primary Antibody Mix:   5µL   Primary #1 MyoD (Santa Cruz)
(1:200  ) + 995 µL Blocking Buffer  
  
Total volume required = 1000 uL

4\. Prepared Primary Antibody Mix:  10 µL   Primary #1 TE-7   (1:100  ) + 990
µL Blocking Buffer  
  
Total volume required = 1000 uL

Vortexed antibody mix for 5 seconds and stored refrigerated away from light
until needed.

Process:

Permeabilise

1\. Removed PBS from each well.

2\. Added 150 µL PBST (0.2% Triton-X) to each well for 15 min: 10:42 - 10:57

3\. Aspirated PBST for each well.




Blocking

1\. Added  150 µL of blocking buffer per well (3% BSA in PBST [0.1% Triton-X])
and incubate for 45 minutes - 1hr at RT. (no more than 1 hour):  11:00 - 11:50




Single Primary Antibody staining

1\. Removed blocking buffer from each well.

2\. Incubated cells with primary antibody for 90 mins - 2 hr, wrapped in foil:
12:00 - 13:30  

After this step, all further task should be performed in a dark room. The
vessel should also be wrapped foil when not used.

Secondary Antibody Staining

6496-DOLLY12-Sheep P11-1of196-well plate10  
  
  




Reagent preparation:

1\. Aliquotted   14 mL   PBS for washing

2\. Centrifuged the secondary antibody stock using the benchtop
microcentrifuge for 10 seconds.

3\. Prepared Secondary Antibody mix:

1µL   Secondary #1 AF555 IgG2b  (1:1000  ) +   999µL Blocking Buffer (PBST
(0.1% Triton X + dPBS) + 3% BSA)  

Total volume required =  1000 uL

4\. Prepared Secondary Antibody mix:

 1µL   Secondary #1 AF488 IgG1  (1:1000  ) +   999µL Blocking Buffer (PBST
(0.1% Triton X + dPBS) + 3% BSA)  

Total volume required =  1000 uL

If using AlexaFluor secondary antibodies then the max concentration should be
1:500 (typically used at 1:1000)

Vortexed antibody mix for 5 seconds and stored refrigerated away from light
until needed.

4\. Prepared DAPI (1:1000) mix:

 999 uL  PBS +  1 uL  of DAPI

Vortexed DAPI mix and stored refrigerated away from light until needed.

Process:

1\. Removed plate after being incubated with primary antibodies.

2\. Washed 3 times for 5 min with PBS at RT.

13:36 - 13:41

13:43 - 13:48

13:49 - 13:54

3\. Incubated the cells with secondary antibody mixture in the dark at RT for
1 hour.  14:02 - 15:02

NOTE: from this step onwards protect from the light by wrapping plates in foil
and perform experiment in the dark.




Counter staining

1\.  Removed 2nd antibody solution.  15:05

2\.  Washed with DAPI (1:1000) in PBS for 5 min at RT in the dark.

15:07 - 15:12

3\.  Washed in PBS 3 x 5 min at RT in the dark. (No Triton)

15:13 - 15:18

15:19 - 15:24

4\.  Replaced dPBS.

15:25  

5\. Confirmed staining on microscope by imaging.
