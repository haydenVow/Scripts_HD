Prep of growth media:

1\. Prep growth media mixes and store at 4'C

*Growth Media: RPMI + 7% FBS + 1X P/S + hydrolysate (5g/L)

In order to make media with hydrolysates at 5g/L just add 5 mL of the
hydrolysate concentrate to 100 mL of growth media.

Process:

1\. Aliquotted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then
placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath for a minimum of 20 minutes
prior to use:

  1. TrypLE:    18   mL in   1x 50 mL   tube   12:19   

  2. dPBS (for neutralising)    36   mL in    1x 50 mL   tube  12:19   

  3. Growth media (for seeding/pellet resuspension):  
 7 mL ( Condition 1/2/5/serum control) 1 mL for pellet resuspension     12:19  

  4. Times that all aliquots were placed in the water bath to warm before use

Note: if aliquots were placed in water bath at different times, record the
time stamp for each individual solution.




2\. Washed the flask(s) with dPBS.

3\. Added    3   mL tryple to each vessel/well and incubated at 37˚C for   20
min.

Note: Fibroblasts typically require 15-18 minutes of incubation with tryple,
slightly longer than MuSCs.

  1. Start/Finish time for tryple was   12:44    \-   13:04    

4\. Neutralised with    3 mL   dPBS (warmed) and combined cell suspension into
separate    15 mL   tubes.

5\. Centrifuged at 650 x g for 5 min

  1. Start/Finish time for centrifugation was   13:20  \-  13:25   




6\. Aspirated the supernatant(s)

7\. Resuspended pellet(s) in      1  mL    growth   media.

8\. Performed a cell count using the haemocytometer and recorded the cell
count data in widget or the Google Doc spreadsheet called 'Cell Count
Spreadsheet' (see link below):

SSIBtIylyrBQE5kRX5Z8NtI/edit#gid=0

  




9\. Total cell number was:

Condition 1:   464,000  

Condition 2:   320,000  

Condition 3:   896,000  

Condition 5:   352,000  

RPMI control:   920,000  

Serum control:    776,000  

10\. Seeded ~7k cells per cm2 of the flasks/plates. Note that fibroblasts
prefer to be subcultured closely together.

11\. Volume of cell suspension required for subculture was:   T25s (175,000
cells)  
 377 uL (Condition 1)  

533 uL (Condition 2)  

195 uL (Condition 3)  

497 uL (Condition 5)  

190 uL (RPMI control)

225 uL (Serum control)  

12\. Transferred   required volume of cell suspension to the pre-warmed   5 mL
Growth Media aliquots.

13\. Transfer cell suspension into (non-gelatin coated)  T25 flasks.

14\. Transfer flask/plate(s) to incubate at:  14:36  

  * [x]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (aviary cells)




Observations/Summary:

\- Low cell numbers in hydrolysate conditions compared the RPMI and serum
control.
