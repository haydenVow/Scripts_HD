2\. Aliquotted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then
placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath for a minimum of 20 minutes
prior to use:

  *  Growth media (for seeding):    30 mL
  *  Time that aliquots were placed in the water bath to warm before use:  10:45

  




## Thaw and seed vial:

1\. Collected the cryovial from liquid nitrogen storage & place in foam
floater in water bath for 5 min    11:25 am  

Location where cryovial was collected from:

Vial details:  1   x   MCB cryovials at   1M  cells.

Vial ID(s):3375-Culture-7768-Vial-1of11- TOWER 5, BOX 1, A1

2.Ethanol sprayed & transferred the vial the the BSC

3\. Added 500ul of Growth media to the cryovial, resuspended the cell
suspension gently to reduce osmotic shock.

4\.  Take a 20ul aliquot and set aside to perform cell count. 786.000 in 1 ml  

5\. Collected the 1mL of cell sustention & transferred into the pre-warmed
Growth Media.

6\. Using a p1000 micropipette, resuspend & distribute the cells evenly in the
30mL pre-warmed Growth Media

7\. Transfer cell suspension to 1x T175 11:34

`8. Take the 20ul aliquot and perform cell count. Note: A cell count should be
performed prior to seeding after an isolate thaw to ensure accurate viability
data at seed.`
