Process:

  1. Imaged all wells in 'Row B' of both plates at 4x and 10x using the Primo
  2. Aliquotted  40 mL  mL of  Growth Media 
  3. Added   20 uL  mL of p38i. 
  4. Placed in water bath  13:50
  5. Removed 100% of supernatant (per well/per vessel) and replaced with 1.5mL of Growth media, ensuring to do so one well at a time. Changed tips between plates (can keep the same tip for all wells in a plate).
  6. Returned vessel to incubate at: 14:43 (plate 1)  14:53 (plate 2)
