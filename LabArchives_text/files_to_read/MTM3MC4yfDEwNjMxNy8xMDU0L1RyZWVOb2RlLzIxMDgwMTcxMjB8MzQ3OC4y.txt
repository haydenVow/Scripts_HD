Process:

The following steps were performed using a multichannel pipette by aspirating
reagents from 1 plate and adding the next reagent. Then repeating this for the
other 2 plates before moving to the next step.  

  1. Aspirate PBS from wells. Incubate with 50 uL/well of DAPI (1:1000 in PBS). 13:58 - 14:06 
  2. Aspirate DAPI from wells. Incubate with 150uL/well of PBS. 14:09 - 14:18
  3. Aspirate PBS. Add fresh PBS (200uL/well). ~14:22
  4. DAPI staining was confirmed on the Axio microscope.
  5. Plates were imaged on the main lab Zaber with the following settings:
    1. DAPI: illuminator lamp intensity 35, exposure 15, histogram: 0-90 
    2. AF488: illuminator lamp intensity 37, exposure 400, histogram: 40-170
    3. 5x magnification
