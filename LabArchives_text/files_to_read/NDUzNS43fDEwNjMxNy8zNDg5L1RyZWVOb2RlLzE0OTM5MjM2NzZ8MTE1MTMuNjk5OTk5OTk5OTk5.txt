Process:

  1. Aliquoted:
    1. 1.5 mL  of  each of the growth media conditions above   

    2. 15 mL of DMEM/F12 + 10% FBS + 1X P/S 
    3. 15 mL of GM + HDAC 1 (0.1ug/mL)  

    4. 15 mL of GM + HDAC 2 (0.1ug/mL)  
Placed in water bath: 12:25  

  2. Collected culture vessels from shakers, wiped with ethanol-sprayed cloth and brought into BSC (if necessary, paused shakers by pressing the "play" button on the controller on the side wall of the incubator)
  3. Using a p1000 for the 6-well plate cultures and a 5 mL serelogical pipette for the E125 flasks, gently pipette-mixed cultures for ~1 minute to break up cell clumps
  4. Pipetted suspensions though 70 um cell strainer into 8 x 15 mL tubes  and 3 x 50 mL flasks (keep E125 flask and 6-well plates in BSC as cultures will be returned to these post centrifugation) 
  5. Centrifuged at 300 x g for 5 min.
    1. Timestamp: 12:50 - 12:55    

  6. Aspirated supernatants, taking care to not disrupt or aspirate pellet
  7. Re-suspended all cultures in 500 uL of their respective growth media. 
  8. Replaced fresh, warmed media in all cultures 
  9. Gently pipette-mixed cultures again before moving back to E125 flask and 2 x 6-well plates 
  10. Took 100 uL samples from each culture and placed in separate wells of 96-WP
  11. Returned vessels to incubator and replaced in clamp. If shaker was paused, remembered to press play to restart shaking. 6-well plates should be shaking at 150 RPM and E125 at 120 RPM)
    1. Timestamp 13:34  

  * Incubator (#116 & #81), Lab [Main]




Stain and image:

  1. Took 100 uL samples of each culture, transferred to wells in 96 well plate
  2. Prepared stain buffer of equal volumes of NucBlue and NucGreen reagents (M6457)
  3. Added 10 uL of stain buffer to each well, pipet mixed each well
  4. Incubated at room temperature in the dark for 20 minutes  16:08 - 16:30   

  5. Centrifuged at 650 RCF for 1 minute 16:31 - 16:32
  6. Took images of each well on the blue and green fluorescence channels using the Zaber on
