Prepare materials for thaw and seed:

  *  ~~ ~~NOTE: IF PERFORMING A THAW FROM A CLONAL MCB_2 OR WCB_2, PREPARE AT LEAST ONE EXTRA 96 WELL PLATE FOR A DIFFERENTIATION ASSAY. THIS IS AN IMPORTANT QUALITY CONTROL STEP WHILE WE BUILD OUR CLONAL CELL BANK.~~~~
  *  ~~Suggested layout for diff assay (please refer to previous diff assays for exact seeding, feeding and analysis procedures)  
~~

  *  ~~~~

 ~~1\. Gelatin coated    x    flasks/plates with sterile filtered 0.1% gelatin
solution and then incubated all coated flasks at 37ºC ~~

  *  ~~ ~~Time when all flasks placed into the incubator    : a/pm~~ ~~

2\. Aliquotted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then
placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath for a minimum of 20 minutes
prior to use:

  *  Growth media (for seeding):   30 mL 
  * Time that aliquot was placed in the water bath to warm before use:  15 : 30a/pm 

  




## Thaw and seed vial:

3\. Collected the cryovial from Liquid Nitrogen storage & place in foam
floater in water bath for 5 min 15 :35 - 15:

Location where cryovial was collected from:

Vial details:  1   x  1mL cryovials at   2M  cells each for a total of
2Mcells

Brew

Tower/Bucket # 6

Box/Cane # 6

Vial location:C5

Vial ID(s):14479

`4. Ethanol sprayed & transferred the vial(s) to the BSC.`

`5.  Added 500µL of Growth Media (to generate a total volume of 1mL in the
cryovial) to the cryovial, resuspended the cell suspension gently to reduce
osmotic shock. `

`6. Collected the entire 1mL of cell suspension & transfer into the pre-warmed
tube of Growth Media. `

`7. Using a 10mL serological pipette, resuspended & distributed the cells
evenly in the 5.5mL of pre-warmed Growth Media (prepared in Step 2). `

`8. Aliquot 10uL into a tube for cell count. `

`Total cell number: 2,482,400 cells in 5.8 mL of growth medium`

  * equally split the growth medium into 2x T175 
  * ``seed density: 7092.57 cell/cm^2

`8. Transfered   30mL to each pre-coated  T175  flask/well, (2xT175 total)  
`

`9. Transfered flask/plate(s) to incubate at: `

  * [ X]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (aviary cells)

  

Making labels

Note - You will need to increase the passage number by one. (i.e. if your
thawed vial ID has a passage number of 3, when you make a culture ID for you
vessel you will need change the passage number to 4 on Airtable.)

Summary:

1x cryovial of chicken chondrocytes was thawed and resuspended in 30mL of
DMEM/F12+20%FBS+1XP/S at a ``seed density: 7092.57 cell/cm^2 and then placed
in a incubator at 37C.
