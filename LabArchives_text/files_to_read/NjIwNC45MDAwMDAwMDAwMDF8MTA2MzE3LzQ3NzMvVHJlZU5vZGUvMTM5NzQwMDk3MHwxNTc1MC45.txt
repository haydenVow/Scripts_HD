Observations

Cultures were examined under the microscope. When adherent cells were
observed, images were taken. See mia links below.

Culture  
Observations  
  
8241-WALLE02-Bennets Wallaby P0-1of1  
A few very small clusters of cells in A2, no adherent cell observed in B1,
Some areas are 100% confluent in B2(while the majority of the well is bare).
Passaged B2 today and discarded the rest.  
  
8243-WALLE04-Bennets Wallaby P0-1of1  
No adherent cells observed in B1, a few small clusters of adhered cells in A2
and B2. Discarded today.  
  
8533-F_WALLE04-Bennets Wallaby P1-1of1  
Less debris that 8532, estimated confluence, 80%- passaged today  
  
8532-F_WALLE02-Bennets Wallaby P1-1of1  
A lot of debris, particularly in the centre of the well. Estimated confluence,
50%- Not passaged today

### Process:  

3\. Aliquoted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then
placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath for a minimum of 20 minutes
prior to use:

  1. TrypLE:     3  mL in     1 x   tube
  2.  dPBS (for washing and neutralising):    3  mL 
  3. dPBS (for neutralising):    3 mL
  4. Growth media (for pellet resuspension +seeding):    5 mL 

Time that all aliquots were placed in the water bath the warm before use
08:00  

Note: if aliquots were placed in water bath at different time, record the time
stamp for each individual solution.




4\. Removed vessel(s) from the incubator

5\. Washed the vessel(s) with dPBS (warmed).08:10

6\. Added    2ml (6 well plate)/500ul(24 well plate)  mL tryple to each
vessel/well and incubated at 37˚C.

  1. Start/Finish for TrypLE was   08:30-09:00 (checked under the microscope at 10min and then every 5 min thereafter)  

7\. Neutralised with    2ml (6 well plate)/500ul(24 well plate)   dPBS and
combined cell suspension.

8\. Centrifuged at 650 x g for 5 min.

  1. Start/Finish time for centrifugation was  09:35-09:40   




9\. Aspirated the supernatant(s).

10\. Resuspended each pellet(s) in    1  mL       growth   media

11\. Aliquoted   10ul     of resuspended cells into a microcentrifuge tube for
cell count.

12\. Performed a cell count using the haemocytometer and recorded the cell
count data in the Google Doc spreadsheet called 'Cell Count Spreadsheet' (see
link below):

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1DPzKubYxfHmWogVPihC-
SSIBtIylyrBQE5kRX5Z8NtI/edit#gid=0

  1. Total cell number was:  8241WALLE02: 36,000  
8533WALLE04:12,000  

13\. Added cell suspension into  of growth media. - Note- cells were seeded in
1mL growth media rather that the recommended 500uL for 24 well plates in order
to avoid needing to re-centrifuge WALLE04.  
8241WALLE02: 3mL  
8533WALLE04: Left in 1mL media  

14\. Seeded into  
8241WALLE02: 3 x wells of a 24 well plate (1mL/well) 6315/cm  
8533WALLE04: 1 x wells of a 24 well plate (entire 1mL volume) 6315/cm  

15\. Placed in incubator at Library #68 09:40




Process- Feed.  

8532-F_WALLE02-Bennets Wallaby P1-1of1 was not passaged today so instead
received a 50% feed.  

2\. Removed  50 % of supernatant . 09:00

3\. Replaced with   ~~~~1 mL of   growth  media per well.

4\. Returned vessel to incubate at: 09:10

### Observations/Summary:  
Note: Counts are unlikely to be accurate due to very low cell numbers  
It also took 30 minutes to tryplize the cells, which were checked at 10min and
every 5 minutes thereafter. Despite looking confluent, only 12,000 cells were
harvested from WALLE04.
