Observation of KHAKIF cultures prior to passage

The 2 KHAKIF cultures were vastly different, with 1 culture 80% confluent and
the other was just 10% confluent.  Harvested cell number was extremely low. I
believe that the non-vented caps have had a detrimental affect on cell growth.
For this reason, all cells were re-seeded into a single, vented T75 flask to
see if they can recover. It is also possible that cells are being lost during
centrifugation. I have been informed by other lab users that the centrifuge is
"unpredictable".

Process:

  1. Aliquoted reagents and placed in the cell culture incubator to warm > 40 minutes prior to use  
TrypLE:  20mL  
dPBS (for washing and neutralising)    40mL  
Growth media (for pellet resuspension and reseeding): 20mL

  2. Washed the flask(s) with dPBS.
  3.  Added | 10 |mL tryple to each vessel/well and incubated at 37ÂºC for | 10 | min. 
  4. Neutralised with |10mL  | dPBS (warmed) and combined cell suspension into a |50mL (per culture)| tube. 
  5. Centrifuged at approximately 650 x g for 5 min.
  6. Aspirated the supernatant(s).
  7. Resuspend pellet(s) in |5|mL | medias | 
  8.  Performed a cell count using the hemocytometer and recorded the cell count data in the Google Doc spreadsheet called 'Cell Count Spreadsheet' (see link below):

SSIBtIylyrBQE5kRX5Z8NtI/edit#gid=0

  9. Total cell number was:  
|KHAKIF: 800,00 |

  10. All cells were reseeded into 1 x T75 flask.
