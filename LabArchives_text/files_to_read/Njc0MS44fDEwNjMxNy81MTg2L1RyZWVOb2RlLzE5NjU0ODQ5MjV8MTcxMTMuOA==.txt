Process:

  1. Used the  2 x 40 mL  aliquots of  Growth Media + p38i contained in the Weekend Feeds Only box in the 117 fridge.
  2. Placed in water bath   10: 18 am

  

Removed all C2C12 96 wp (6 plates in total) from the incubator into the BSC.

Remove 1 x 40 ml urine pot containing warm DMEM/F12 + 20% FBS + 1x P/S + p38i
media from the water bath labelled with C2C12.

  1. Removed  50% (100uL) of DMEM/F12 + 20% FBS + 1x P/S + p38i supernatant from vessel (All the wells contained between wells B3 to ~~B11 and G3~~ to G11).
  2. Use 3 tips of the multi-channel pipette to aspirate the media from wells ~~~~~~B3-B5 (horizontally).~~
  3.  ~~There is NO NEED TO CHANGE TIPS for the feeds of the 6 x 96 wp containing C2C12 cells.~~
  4.  ~~Add 100uL warm media to wells B3-B5 immediately.~~
  5.  ~~Aspirate from wells B6-B8 (horizontally).~~
  6.  ~~Add 100uL warm media to wells B6-B8  immediately.~~
  7.  ~~Aspirate from wells B9-B11 (horizontally).~~
  8.  ~~Add 100uL warm media to wells B9-B11  immediately.~~
  9.  ~~Repeat for rows  C, D, E, F, and G in all 6 x 96 wp plates.~~
  10. Replaced with 50% (100uL) of DMEM/F12 + 20% FBS + 1x P/S per well
  11. Returned vessels to incubate at:   12:30

*There are 3 wells in 1 of the plates that we did not have enough media + cells for, DO NOT FEED these.  

Removed all DOLLY12 96 wp (6 plates in total) from the incubator into the BSC.

Remove 1 x 40 ml urine pot containing warm DMEM/F12 + 20% FBS + 1x P/S + p38i
media from the water bath labelled with DOLLY12.

  10. Replaced with 50% (100uL) of DMEM/F12 + 20% FBS + 1x P/S + p38i per well
  11. Returned vessels to incubate at:  13:05

*There are 3 wells in 1 of the plates that we did not have enough media + cells for, DO NOT FEED these.
