Media/Reagents used:

NameDetailsVolume used (mL)  
Growth/Proliferation MediumMix #6191 + S3199  
50 mL  
  
  

Growth Medium: DMEM + 10% FBS + 1xP/S + 1:100 anti-clumping agent




Process:

  1. Aliquoted:
    1.  25 mL  of  DMEM + 10% FBS + 1xP/S + 1:100 ACA   
Placed in water bath: 11:55  

  2. Paused shakers by pressing the "play" button on the controller on the side wall of the incubator
  3. Collected culture vessel from shaker, wiped with ethanol-sprayed cloth and brought into BSC
  4. Using a 5 mL serelogical pipette, gently pipette-mixed culture for 1 minute to break up cell clumps
  5. Pipetted suspension though 70 um cell strainer into 1 x 50 mL tube
  6. Centrifuged at 300 x g for 5 min. Timestamp: 12:30 - 12:35
  7. Re-Centrifuged at 350 x g for 5 min (pellet too lose to safely aspirate) 12:37 - 12:42
  8. Aspirated supernatant, taking care to not disrupt or aspirate pellet 
  9. Re-suspended cultures in 500 uL of growth media.
  10. Took 1 x 20 uL aliquot and performed cell count, recording counts in this spreadsheet https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1YuTvXJXQQMIMwRZGeqNjdi20WeURg5FpM-1TJ-zrb1c/edit#gid=1104649984
    1. Count (NANDO): 14,000
    2. Count (DOLLY): 56,000
  11. Replaced fresh, warmed media
  12. Gently pipette-mixed culture again before moving back to E125 flask
  13. Returned vessel to incubator and replaced in clamp. Pressed "play" at side of incubators. Timestamp: 11:46

### Observations/Summary:

 100 % media changed on vessel(s)

  1. 7342-NANDO3F-Chicken P3-1of1
  2. 7465-F_DOLLY12-Sheep P8-1of1  
  
Cell suspensions were very clumpy - think straining got rid of a large
majority of cells. Pellet was also very loose - centrifuged twice before count
but still may have aspirated cells.
