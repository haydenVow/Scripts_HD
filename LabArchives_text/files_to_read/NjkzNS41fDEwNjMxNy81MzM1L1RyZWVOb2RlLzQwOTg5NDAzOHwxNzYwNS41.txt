Process:

Bradford:

  1. Added 12 drops of Hoescht 33342 to 24mL of Milli-Q water.
  2. Removed media supernatant from the 24 well plate and added 500uL of Hoescht/Milli-Q water mix.
  3. Performed serial dilutions of BSA stock till all concentrations [2000,1500,1000,750.500,250,125,25,12.5,6.75,0 mg/ml]
  4. Incubated in the dark at RT for 15 mins [15:19 pm - 15:34]
  5. Imaged relevant rows on Zaber for cell normalisation.
  6. Thawed v2 mince sample (in 50mL falcon tube) in water bath until room temp was acheived.
  7. Weighed out 8 replicate samples of the v2 mince aiming for similar weights.
  8. Submerged each mince sample in 1mL PBS
  9. Ground up each sample using spatula, aiming for a slurry solution of mince in PBS.
  10. Performed freeze-thaw lysis protocol on the 24 well plate and 8 eppendorf tubes containing the mince samples [ 16:21 - 16:27pm, 16:27 - 16:33 a/pm, 16:33 - 16:39 a/pm]
  11. Centrifuged tubes for 5 mins at 1000g using micro-centrifuge.
  12. Tested volumes of BUFFY and v2 mince supertnatant against 250uL of Bradford reagent until grey/brown colour is achieved.
  13. Eventual ratio determined was 250uL of Bradford reagent with 20uL of sample.
  14. Constructed a standard curve with BSA solution (2mg/mL) using the determined ratio from the previous step in triplicate.
  15. Added 20uL of each v2 mince and BUFFY sample to 250uL of Bradford reagent in triplicate
  16. Centrifuged all three plates for 3 mins at 300g.
  17. Read absorbance at 595nm.
