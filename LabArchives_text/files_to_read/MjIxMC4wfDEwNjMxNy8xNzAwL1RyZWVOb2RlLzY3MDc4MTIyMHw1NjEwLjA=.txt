### Process:

1\. Took image of vessel with microscope on phase setting.

2\. Place pre-gelatin coated      1     x    4CF      vessel into the
incubator at 37˚C. (Use the gelatin coated flask in the fridge)

  1. Time when all vessels(s) placed into the incubator   11:23 

3\. Aliquotted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then
placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath for a minimum of 20 minutes
prior to use:

  1. TrypLE:     30    mL in     1x 50 mL    tube
  2.  dPBS (At 37 degrees for washing):     30 mL   mL in    1x 50 mL    tube
  3.  dPBS (at RT neutralising):     30 mL    mL in    1x 50 mL    tube
  4. Growth media (for pellet resuspension):     10    mL in     1x 15 mL    tube
  5. Growth media (for seeding):     600    mL in     1x 500 mL    container

Time that all aliquots were placed in the water bath the warm before use
11:39

Note: if aliquots were placed in water bath at different time, record the time
stamp for each individual solution.




4\. Removed vessel(s) from the incubator   11:52

5\. Washed the vessel(s) with dPBS (warmed).

6\. Added     10    mL tryple to each vessel/well and incubated at 37˚C.

  1. Start/Finish for TrypLE was    11:58 - 12:08 

7\. Neutralised with     10     dPBS and combined cell suspension into a
2x 50 mL    tubes.

8\. Centrifuged at 650 x g for 5 min.

  1. Start/Finish time for centrifugation was  12:18 - 12:23  




9\. Aspirated the supernatant(s).

10\. Resuspended pellet(s) in     4    mL     Growth     media  12:32

11\. Aliquoted     10 uL     of resuspended cells into a microcentrifuge tube
for cell count.

12\. Performed a cell count using the haemocytometer and recorded counts in
"Seed Calculator" widget (see below):




13\. Transferred      4000     µl of cell suspension to the pre-warmed
600     mL Growth media:   12:48

14\. Transferred cell suspension into the    600 mL    pre-gelatin coated
1x 4CF     vessel.

15\. Left at RT in the BSC for 20 min to allow cells to settle    12:55 -
13:15  

16\. Transferred vessel(s) to incubate at:

  * [x]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells) thermo incubator
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (avian cells)

### Results:

  * Results were;
    * [ ]  As Usual (this is a repetitive task)
    * [x]  Unexpected because... low cell count
    * [ ]  Need to be further analysed
    * [ ]  Other (.......)
