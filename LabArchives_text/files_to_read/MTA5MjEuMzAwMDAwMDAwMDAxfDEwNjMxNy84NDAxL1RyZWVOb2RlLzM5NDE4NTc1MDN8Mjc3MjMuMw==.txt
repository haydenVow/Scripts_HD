1\. Cell counts performed by Jesi.

  * Cell count viable cells / mL = 2.33 M cells/mL. 
    * Note: Copy the value for 'viable cells per mL) from vicell into the master cell count spreadsheet, with the respective culture ID.
  * Total volume = 124 mL
  * Total number of cells = 288 M cells

  1. 35 M cells were harvested for MCC experiments, 15 mL removed from 124 mL flask with a remaining volume of 109 mL.

  

Seeding density:  2.33 M x10^6 cells / mL

Volume in flask: 109 mL

Flask size: E500 (flat bottom)




## Summary/ Results

Nuvonis cells were counted.

Count in Vicell was 288 M cells (2.33 M cells/mL) with a 99.5% cell viability.
15 mL was removed by Shaleen for the MMC project work (35 M cells). We kept
the same flask and did not add any additional media and placed it in the
incubator (37C, 5%CO2, 120RPM).
