Process:

1\. Aliquotted   32mL  mL of  growth Media into   1x50mL    tube(s). Placed in
water bath   16:30 a/pm

2\. Stopped the shaker and removed cultures from the incubator before
restarting the shaker   16:40 a/pm

3\. Placed suspension flask(s) inside the BSC and allowed to sit static for
3-5 minutes to allow microcarriers to settle to the base of the flask.

2\. Carefully removed  50  % of supernatant from the flask(s) by pipetting
slowly and following the meniscus with the pipette tip so as to avoid placing
the pipette tip near the microcarriers at the base of the flask(s).

3\. Replaced with  30 mL (per well/per vessel) of   growth  media.

4\. Returned vessel to incubate at:   16:50 a/pm , incubator #   68

  * [x]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (aviary cells)
