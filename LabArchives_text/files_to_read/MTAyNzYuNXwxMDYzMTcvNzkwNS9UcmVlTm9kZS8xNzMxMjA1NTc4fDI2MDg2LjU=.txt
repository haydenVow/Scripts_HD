Process
  
  
  1. Removed flasks from incubator 
  2. Took 2 x 100 uL samples from each E500 and 2 x 50 uL samples from E125
  3. Performed cell counts and averaged for each flask and each condition (recorded in table below)
  4. If cell density is > 1,000,000 cells/mL in any cultures, aliquoted X mL of media with growth factors and warmed in water bath to reduce density. Checked table below to see if any cultures require expansion into larger E-flask. 
    1. 75/25: Discarding or giving away - there are already lots of frozen vials in 3:1 for MFG use and 75/25 is less important to focus on than 90/10
    2. 90/10: 380 mL + IGF + EGF (topping up to 500 mL) 
    3. 100: 30 mL + IGF + EGF (100% feed - still seems to be in adapting phase)
    4. Freestyle: N/A - was fed yesterday
  5. Transferred 100 culture to 1 x 50 mL flask 
  6. Centrifuged at 500 x g for 5 min 
  7. Aspirated 100% of supernatant and resuspended in 30 mL warmed media 
  8. Strained 100 culture through 40 um cell strainer and transferred back to E125 
  9. Added 380 mL to 90/10 culture 
  10. Strained 90/10 culture through 40 um cell strainer and transferred to E500 flask 
  11. Returned cultures to incubate at 37'C, 5% CO2, 120 RPM

look healthy, pretty consistent. No clumping on counts but can see some
clumping in flask - not too bad

quite a lot of variation in morphology but don't look too unhealthy. Some
