Media/Reagents used:

NameDetailsVolume used (mL)  
Growth/Proliferation MediumMix #6191 + S3199  
50 mL  
  
  

Growth Medium: DMEM + 10% FBS + 1xP/S + 1:100 anti-clumping agent




Process:

  1. Aliquoted:
    1.  26 mL  of  DMEM + 10% FBS + 1xP/S + 1:100 ACA x2  
Placed in water bath: 11:35  

  2. Paused shakers by pressing the "play" button on the controller on the side wall of the incubator
  3. Collected culture vessel from shaker, wiped with ethanol-sprayed cloth and brought into BSC
  4. Using a 5 mL serelogical pipette, gently pipette-mixed culture for 1 minute to break up cell clumps
  5. Pipetted suspension though 70 um cell strainer into 1 x 50 mL tube
  6. Centrifuged at 300 x g for 5 min. Timestamp: 11:56 - 12:01
  7. Aspirated supernatant, taking care to not disrupt or aspirate pellet 
  8. Re-suspended pellet in 500 uL growth media
  9. Took 2 x 10 uL aliquots from cell suspension
  10. Performed cell counts and recorded in cell-count spreadsheet: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1YuTvXJXQQMIMwRZGeqNjdi20WeURg5FpM-1TJ-zrb1c/edit#gid=1104649984
    * Count NANDO: 426,800
    * Count DOLLY: 120,000
  11. Replaced with fresh, warmed media
  12. Gently pipette-mixed culture again before moving back to E125 flask
  13. Returned vessel to incubator and replaced in clamp. Pressed "play" at side of incubators. Timestamp: 12:16

  * Incubator (#68), Lab [Main/Library/Production]




### Observations/Summary:

 100 % media changed on vessel(s)

  1. 7342-NANDO3F-Chicken P3-1of1
  2. 7465-F_DOLLY12-Sheep P8-1of1  
  
DOLLY cells very clumpy on count - difficult to discern true number. NANDO had
some clumps but far less than DOLLY. Counts suggest that NANDO cells might be
better at adapting to suspension than DOLLY cells.
