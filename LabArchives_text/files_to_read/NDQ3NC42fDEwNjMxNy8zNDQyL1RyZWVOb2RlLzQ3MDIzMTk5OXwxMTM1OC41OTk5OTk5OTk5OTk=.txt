  3. Centrifuged at 300 x g for 5 min. 14:21 - 14:26
  4. Ethanol sprayed 5 x NANDO shake tubes and loaded on OT2 (Otis)
  5. Ran "Media change 5 x 50 mL tubes suspension culture" protocol (attached above) 
    1. Order of media in 12-well reservoir
      1. control
      2. RPMI
      3. CD CHO
      4. Avian
      5. HyCell
    2. Start time: 2:43:24 PM
    3. End time: 15:00
    4. Run time: 16 min 36 seconds
  6. Returned vessels to incubator and repeated process with 5 x DOLLY 50 mL shake tubes
  7. Centrifuge timestamp: 15:16 - 15:21
    1. Protocol start time: 3:30:09 PM
    2. Protocol end time: 15:44
    3. Run time: 14 min 27 seconds
  8. Returned vessels to incubator.

Process E125 flasks:

1\. Transfer culture vessels to BSC

2\. Using a 5 mL serological pipette, gently pipette-mixed culture for 1
minute to break up cell clumps

3\. Pipetted suspension though 70 um cell strainer into 2 x 50 mL tube

4\. Centrifuged at 300 x g for 5 min. 16:33 - 16:38

5\. Aspirated supernatant, taking care to not disrupt or aspirate pellet

6\. Re-suspended cultures in fresh 25 ml of appropriate media using
serological.

8\. Gently pipette-mixed cultures again before moving back to spin tubes

9\. Returned vessel to incubator and replaced in clamp. 16:45  

[X ]  37ÂºC, 5% CO2

  

  




Stain and image:

  1. Took 100 uL samples of each culture, transferred to wells in 96 well plate
  2. Prepared two stain buffers of:
    1. 1 mL dPBS and 5 drops Hoechst  
    2. 1 mL dPBS and 5 drops NucGreen  
  3. Added 20 uL of Hoechst stain buffer to each well, pipet mixed each well
  4. Incubated at room temperature in the dark for 10 minutes  16:43 -16:53   

  5. Added 20 uL of NucGreen stain buffer to each well, pipet mixed each well
  6. Incubated at room temperature in the dark for 10 minutes  16:55 - 17:05   

  7. Centrifuged at 650 RCF for 1 minute 17:09 - 17:10  

  8. Took images of each well on the blue and green fluorescence channels using the Zaber on culture 7742  
  9. Plate setup was as follows:
    1. Row B, 2-5:
      1. 7743
      2. 7415
      3. 7465

Observations from watching OT2 process NANDO:

\- dispense speed of new media to tube is very slow - we can speed this up a
lot Increased to 700 uL/s

\- could we also speed up aspiration from fresh medium? Q for Derek: Is it
safe to do faster than "default"? Will it be accurate?  

\- did not aspirate full 4.5 from cultures - think the cultures had less than
5 mL in them, maybe from evaporation? Or just less exact measuring during
feeds

\- maybe slow down aspiration to be safer? It's already at default which is
quite slow - probably being over-cautious with this one

\- 500 uL of dead volume in 12-well reservoir works well, however Avani uses
1.5 mL dead vol. Also, 12-well reservoir was slightly warped so the middle of
the base came up higher than the edges - meant that the pipette was trying to
aspirate but was touching the bottom of the well so couldn't get all media.
Only impacted culture 7697, and the rest of the medium was added by hand after
protocol. Given these issues, it might be best to use 15 mL tubes instead of a
12 mL reservoir. Also more sterile.

\- Add protocol with sampling step for end of each culture e.g. after mixing,
takes 100 uL and puts in 96WP for staining

  

Observations from watching DOLLY

\- 700 is too fast - generated bubbles on surface - going to adjust to 300 and
see how next feed looks
