Trialling cell culture without antibiotics


26/11/2021

1x Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (DPBS) made up: 9.6 g powder/L dH2O
(non-sterile as no vacuum pump was yet available in the Melbourne lab)

FBS thawing in fridge

29/11/2021

5 cryovials of sheep fibroblasts (Dolly 12 fibroblasts) placed in red bucket
of liquid N2 tank.

Vial ID order in cryogenic vial cane (top to bottom):

  1. 2319
  2. 2321
  3. 2317

Seed fibroblasts at 7,000 cells/cm2 in 2x T75 flasks:

  1. DMEM/F-12 media containing 10% FBS was prepared but NO PEN-STREP (penicillin-streptomycin antibiotic mixture) was included as this was not yet available in the Melbourne lab. 500 μl was filtered using the handheld vacuum pump.
  2. Media warmed to 37°C in water bath.
  3. Vial 2319 (containing ~1 million cells in 1 mL media) removed from LN2 and thawed in 37°C water bath for precisely 5 minutes.
  4. Contents of vial 2319 added to 24 mL warmed DMEM/F-12 media.
  5. 12 mL cells + media mixture added to each of two T75 flasks.
  6. Flasks swirled in 'figure 8' motion and then allowed to sit for 15 minutes in hood before being picked up and moved to incubator/microscope.
  7. Counted/visualised remaining cells on haemocytometer.
  8. 2x T75 flasks placed in 37°C incubator.

At the start of each day:

  1. UV lamp on for 15 minutes
  2. Water bath heated to 37°C (turn water bath to highest setting and then down to 37°C setting when water reaches 37°C)
  3. Visualise cells

At the end of each day:

  1. Visualise and image cells post-media change
  2. Cap of bleach in water bath

02/12/2021 Lab maintenance:

  1. Thorough cleaning of inverted microscope
  2. TrypLE delivery arrived

100% media change:

  1. 25 mL of DMEM/F-12 media warmed to 37°C in water bath.
  2. All 12 mL media removed from each flask.
  3. 12 mL fresh DMEM/F-12 media added to both T75 flasks.

03/12/2021

50% media feed:

  1. 13 mL of DMEM/F-12 media warmed to 37°C in water bath.
  2. 6 mL old media removed from each flask.
  3. 6 mL fresh DMEM/F-12 media added to both T75 flasks.

05/12/2021

50% media feed:

  1. 13 mL of DMEM/F-12 media warmed to 37°C in water bath.
  2. 6 mL old media removed from each flask.
  3. 6 mL fresh DMEM/F-12 media added to both T75 flasks.

06/12/2021

Splitting cells in 10 T75 flasks:

  1. TrypLE, PBS, and media warmed to 37°C.
  2. Media removed.
  3. Cells washed with 5 mL PBS.
  4. Cells released from flask: incubated in 5 mL TrypLE for ~ 5 mins in 37°C incubator.
  5. TrypLE inactivated by dilution with 5 mL PBS.
  6. Cells collected in 50 mL tube after 2nd wash of flasks with PBS.
  7. Tubes spun at speed 6 for 10 minutes.
  8. Cells resuspended in 1 mL DMEM/F-12 media.
  9. Cell count:

A: 254 + 227 + 223 + 196 = 900; B: 261 + 272 + 204 + 212 = 949; 900 + 949 =
1849*2*104= 4.62 x 106 cells/mL

To seed cells at original seeding density of 500,000 cells/flask, cells were
split across 9 flasks. The remaining cells were grown up in a 10th flask at
lower density.

50% media feed:

  1. DMEM/F-12 media warmed to 37°C in water bath.
  2. 6 mL old media removed from each flask.
  3. 6 mL fresh DMEM/F-12 media added to each of the 10 T75 flasks.

10/12/2021

50% media feed:

  1. DMEM/F-12 media warmed to 37°C in water bath.
  2. 6 mL old media removed from each flask.
  3. 6 mL fresh DMEM/F-12 media added to each of the 10 T75 flasks.

10/12/2021 Lab maintenance:

  1. Pen-Strep thawing in fridge to be aliquoted on Sunday.

12/12/2021

CONCLUSION to trialing cell culture without antibiotics: We were able to
culture Dolly 12 Sheep Fibroblasts without antibiotics for over two weeks
without contamination indicating that with proper aseptic technique,
successful cell culture in the Melbourne Co-Labs facility is possible.

  


Culturing Dolly 12 Sheep Fibroblasts under standard conditions (incl. antibiotics)


12/12/2021

50% media feed:

  1. DMEM/F-12 media warmed to 37°C in water bath.
  2. 6 mL old media removed from each flask.
  3. 6 mL fresh DMEM/F-12 media (complete media: 10% FCS; 1% Pen-Strep) added to each of the 10 T75 flasks.

12/12/2021 Lab maintenance:

  2. Pen-strep aliquoted (9.5 mL per tube)

These cells will be used for our first microcarrier experiment to be set up
tomorrow.
