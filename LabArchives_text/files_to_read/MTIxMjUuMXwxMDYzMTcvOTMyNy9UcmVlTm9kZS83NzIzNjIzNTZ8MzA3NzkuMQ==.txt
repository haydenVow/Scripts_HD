Passaged the 20% serum adapted CHOMP cells into new vessels today.  
  
Cells were passaged as normal out of 5xT75 flasks (ID's 13145-13149)

  1. Cells were washed with sterile filtered dPBS 
  2. Wash was removed and cells were covered with 5mL of sterile filtered tryple-EDTA per flask. 
  3. Cells were incubated for 30 degrees at 5% CO2 for 10 minutes. 
  4. Cells were collected into 50mL tubes and flasks were washed down with equal volumes of dPBS to tryple 
  5. Washes were also collected to the same tubes 
  6. Cells were centrifuged at 650g for 5 minutes to pellet 
  7. Supernatant was discarded and cells were resuspended in 20mL of dPBS 
  8. 10uL of cells were taken in triplicate for a trypan blue stain at a 1:2 dilution followed by a count under a hemocytometer. (see cell count entry here, lines 2721-2724 https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1DPzKubYxfHmWogVPihC-SSIBtIylyrBQE5kRX5Z8NtI/edit#gid=0
    1. Only half the cells were counted during this cell count.  

Cells Count total  ~ 6,106,000 in 86mL.

The cell suspension was centrifuged and resuspended in growth media (DMEM/F12
+ 20% FBS + 1xP/S) before being split equally across 6xT175 flasks. (ID's
13340-13345).
