Process
  
  
  1. Prepared control 1: 
    1. 95 mL of HyCell CHO Nuvonis medium with growth factors (0.00005 mg/mL IGF + 0.00001 mg/mL EGF)
  2. Prepared base medium: 
    1. Made 600 mL of R&D 50:50 RPMI:CHO Nuvonis medium without growth factors. 
    2. Added 95 mL of the base medium to each of 6 x 120 mL pots.
  3. Prepared control 2: 
    1. Added growth factors (0.00005 mg/mL IGF + 0.00001 mg/mL EGF) to 1 x 95 mL aliquot
  4. Prepared control 3: 
    1. Added factors for condition 14 as specified in spreadsheet linked below process to 1 x 95 mL aliquot
  5. Prepared conditions 14.1-14.4 according to spreadsheet linked below with remaining 4 x 95 mL aliquots
  6. Aliquoted 1 mL of each media condition into 7 x 1.5 mL eppendorf tubes for biochem analysis and stored in freezer at -20'C
  7. Placed all 95 mL media aliquots in fridge 

  

Amendments:

  * prepared 1.5L R&D formulation without thymidine and hypoxanthine. Reserved 500mL for other purposes
  * concerns around solubility of 40x Amino acid stock -> instead added powders directly to media for a 1x final concentration in 1L media
  * weighed out amino acids and as outlined in G-sheet
  * weighed out hypoxanthine and thymidine powders and added to media as per G-sheet (10mg and 1mg, respectively)
