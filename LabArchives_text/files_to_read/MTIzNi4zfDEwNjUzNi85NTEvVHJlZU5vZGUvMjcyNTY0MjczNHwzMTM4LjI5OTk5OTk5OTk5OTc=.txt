Batch 30 Overview

[CHOMP09]

Batch Total Weight: N/A (Terminated early due to fungal contamination)

Batch Objectives/Outline:

  * Produce ~200g of cell mass for Product 

Batch Timeline (Proliferation days in each passage & Flask no./type):

Passage NumberProliferation daysFlask No./Type  
P16  
1x10CF, 2x4CF  
P277x10CF, 3x4CF  
P34 (terminated early)40x5CS  
  
  

Notable Events:

  * On the 17th January fungal like growth was seen during a passage of the 1x10CF and 2x4CF.
    * It was found to come from one of the 4CF flasks and so the cells from this flask were excluded from the batch passage and were instead given to Sarah for an rNA experiment a we did not know the extent of the danger in using these cells. 
    * As we did not know what the growth was we decided to put it into a T25 flask and sit it on the bench to see if anything grew
    * after 2 days on the bench the fungus looked to be growing and was discarded
    * As this was thought to an isolated infection from the one 4CF and these cells were not mixed with cells from the other flask, no further action was taken.  

Fungus identified on the 17th of January:

Fungus growth observed on the 19th of January:

  

  * 27th January: During a 50% feed on this day 1 out of 40x5CS was seen to contain a similar looking fungal growth to what was seen on the 17th, except this time the colouring was only white. This flask was discarded, all bottles in the hood were changed except for the fresh media bottle, the bench was wiped down and the feed was continued. 
    * on this same say a similar fungal infection was observed in library lab cultures and main lab cultures. All ones that had used the CHOMP09 WCB2
  * 28th January: The next day due to a widespread contamination throughout the laboratory, all flasks were observed carefully under 40x magnification to identify for possible contamination. Spindle-like structures were found in 5+ flasks, indicating potential fungal growth within the cultures. It was decided to discard the flasks due to the identification of 2 fungal infections in this batch (17/01 and 27/01) as well as the visible spindle structures.
