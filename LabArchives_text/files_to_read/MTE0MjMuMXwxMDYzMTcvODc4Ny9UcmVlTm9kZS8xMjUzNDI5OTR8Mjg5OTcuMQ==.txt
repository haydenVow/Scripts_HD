Note  
  
All 200RPM cultures were discarded today due to their being very few or no
surviving cells.




Process:  

  1. Aliquoted 90mL Nuvonis suspension media (without growth factors) into a urine jar
  2. In the BSC, add 4.5ul EGF, 180ul FGF2 and 90ul IGF1-LR3 to the urine jar. 
  3. Placed in the water bath and warm to 37C 
  4. Collected vessels from shaker, Centrifuged for 5 min at 500 RPM
  5. Aspirated and discarded 8mL media from each tube (leaving 2mL)
  6. For the MUSC, KHAKI and eye 200RPM cultures, Cells were passed through a 70um cell strainer. An additional 3mL of fresh media was then also passed over strainer to collect all the cells. From this 4mL cell suspension counts were performed from a 40ul sample. See count spreadsheet here: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1DPzKubYxfHmWogVPihC-SSIBtIylyrBQE5kRX5Z8NtI/edit#gid=0.
  7. Due to concern that filtering was removing all the cells in the 200 RPM cultures (pellet had been visible in KHAKI cultures in particular), Rep 1 of the KHAKI 175 culture was counted both before and after filtering, the filtered count was only slightly lower but given clumps were breaking up fairly well with pippetting alone, it was decided not to continuing with filtering for the remaining cultures (175 KAHKI R2 +R3 , 175 MUSC, 175 EYE, 200 EYE). For these cultures, 8mL of media was discarded after centrifuging and after re-suspension, cells were counted without filtering. 
  8. Added additional 8mL of media to each culture 175RPM cultures, discarded all 200RPM cultures.
