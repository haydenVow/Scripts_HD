BioNOC Preliminary Study

Aim: To see if the CHOMP cells can attach to, grow on and be removed from
BioNOC II macrocarriers. Also to see if we can get some baseline data from our
cells in this environment before seeding them into the CelCradle Bioreactor.  

Questions being investigated:

  1. Do the CHOMP cells attach to the macrocarriers?
  2. What is the optimal seeding density?
  3. Do the CHOMP cells grow on the macrocarriers?
  4. What is the optimal harvest method to get the CHOMP cells off the macrocarriers
  5. What is the best way to monitor cell growth during the batch incubation period?

Original Experiment Plan:

  

  

Deviations from the plan:

  * The pH was not checked every second day. The reason for this was that every time media was removed for a pH test (minimum 5mL), it would need to be replaced, resulting in a changed feeding schedule. I wanted to keep things are close to our normal schedule as possible for direct comparison with multi-layered flasks so chose to only do a pH test at the time of a previously scheduled feed.
  * Did not get to compare cell growth between BioNOC and multi-layered flasks because cell growth was not observed in these experiments
  * The monitoring of cell growth was not very robust in this experiment because I tried a lot of different methods to find a suitable one for future experiments.

  

Results:

1\. Do the CHOMP cells attach to the macrocarriers?  
Yes. Multiple DAPI stains throughout the course of this experiment have
consistently shown cells attached to the carriers. The cells also showed a
great attachment efficiency after 2 hours of incubation during the inoculation
phase. See example DAPI images and attachment efficiency data below.

2\. What is the optimal seeding density?  
Due to the lack of cell growth seen in these experiments it is not possible to
compare the effectiveness of the different seeding densities. Although, the
5,000cells/cm2 condition did seem to have quite a low cell count compared to
the other 2 conditions when looking at the DAPI staining, so for future
experiments I would probably stick between 7,500cells/cm2 and 15,000cells/cm2  
  

3\. Do the CHOMP cells grow on the macrocarriers?  
Based off the results from this experiment I would have to say no. However
after some discussion with Esco Aster, it is believed that there may be a lag
phase of adaption of these cells to the 3D structure and this experiment was
not long enough to allow the cells to overcome this. It is also possible that
the rocking speed was too fast and therefore impeded cell growth. For future
experiments like this I would recommend growing the cells for at least 2 weeks
to see if they are able to overcome this lag phase of adaption, as well as
lowering the rocking speed.  
It is also important to note that the lack of cell growth was not due to
unhealthy/dying cells. This is known because the cells looked healthy during
the post-harvest cell counts, but also because some of the harvested cells
from one of the BioNOC flasks were passaged into a T25 flask and grown up for
an additional week. During this time the cells looked very healthy and
displayed the expected growth rate of CHOMP cells, reaching 100% confluence by
days 7-8.

3a. Follow up question: Is there something wrong with the cells?

To test this, the cells harvested from the 7,500cell/cm2 (1) flask were
passaged into a T25 flask and monitored for 8 days. During this time the cells
were healthy and displayed normal growth rates (See images below). This
suggests that there is likely a lag phase that was not accounted for with the
BioNOC.

4\. What is the optimal harvest method to get the CHOMP cells off the
macrocarriers  
Two harvest methods were tried, 5min in TrypLE and 15min in TrypLE. First it
is important to note that TrypLE itself was successful in removing these cells
from the BioNOC and that both 5 min and 15min incubation time produced very
similar cell counts in all seeding density conditions. For future experiments
an incubation time of 10min should be sufficient for a successful harvest
followed by 4 washes in dPBS with vigorous mixing.

15,000cells/cm2 (2)151,125,000871,000-23  
  
BioNOC was also stained with DAPI before and after harvest with TrypLE. Due to
the very small number of cells left behind on the BioNOC after the harvest we
can confidently say the harvest was successful (see images below).

5\. What is the best way to monitor cell growth during the batch incubation
period?  
A number of DAPI staining protocols were tried. In the end the following was
the most successful:  
1. Take out 1 BioNOC from each (1) tube/flask using sterile forceps  
2\. Add 1mL 70% Ethanol to each well for 15 minutes  
3\. Remove ethanol and wash with dPBS  
4\. Add DAPI (1:1000) in dPBS for 5min  
5\. Remove all liquid and image with Z-stack  
  
However it was very difficult to quantify the number of cells present with
DAPI due to the unusual 3D structure. It was therefore decided that DAPI
staining with z-stack imaging was a useful measure to monitoring obvious cell
growth by eye but not a useful measure of quantifying this growth. To obtain
more robust quantifiable results in future studies a XTT metabolic assay will
be tried.

Side Experiment: Two methods of fixing were tried; Ethanol fixing and PFA
fixing.

  * PFA fixing resulted in a loss of cells off the BioNOC compared to Ethanol.
  * Ethanol was a superior method.

What we learnt/Recommendations for future studies:

  * The CHOMP cells are able to adhere to the BioNOC
  * There may be a lag phase of adaption before proliferation occurs
  * DAPI staining is not a suitable method alone to measure cell growth, a metabolic assay should also be performed
    * Ethanol should be used to fix the cells before staining, not PFA
  * TrypLE is able to remove the cells from the macrocarriers after 10 minutes of incubation and 4 dPBS washes will successfully remove the remaining cells
