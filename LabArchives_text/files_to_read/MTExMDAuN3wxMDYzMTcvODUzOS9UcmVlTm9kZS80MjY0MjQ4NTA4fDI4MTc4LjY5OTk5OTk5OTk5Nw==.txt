Aim / Goal


To seed both the "Pork buns" and "Pork bun" gel to determine the following:

\- Optimal feeding (Every day vs Every 2nd day)

\- Gel vs Bun (Encapsulation vs. Adherent)  
  
Side mission if buns do not form: Include vitamin C in media. (50ug/mL)

ULTIMATE GOAL: Cells to survive in biomaterials and hopefully proliferate.


Hypothesis


The cells will proliferate through the gel when kept in a suspension form on a
shaker to increase perfusion throughout the scaffold.

Things to be mindful of:

\- Scaffold to media concentration

\- Perfusion throughout scaffold

\- Cell clustering and necrotic cores


Protocol


Pork Bun Gel Creation

  1. Weigh out all biomaterial powders (see below) and combine together into a homogenous powder.
    1. \- 2% (w/v) Low viscosity alginate
    2. 2% (w/v)  Metho cellulose (Sigma Aldrich Brand)
    3. 1% (w/v) Xanthan Gum
    4. 1% (w/v) Glucomannan
  2. Hydrate various biomaterials to required volume in PBS. Stir with a spatula until mostly dissolved. If clumps form, try pushing against the side of the jar.
  3. Leave for 1hr in room temperature
  4. Stir to ensure a homogenous biogel, incorporate air in to form bubbles
  5. Autoclave for 30 mins at 121C on liquid setting. Or pressure cook at similar settings with water in pan.
  6. Refrigerate remaining gel overnight at 4C.

Cell Seeding Protocol - FOR PORK BUN GEL

  1. Add growth factors to the growth media. 
  2. Place growth media aliquot in the waterbath (37C) for minimum 20 minutes
  3. Bring other reagents and biogel to RT for 1 hour. 
  4. Perform cell count. Density for experiments: 20 million cells / mL (required density to be proven). 
  5. Passage cells. Put required cell volume into 50mL centrifuge tubes.
  6. Centrifuge cell suspension for 5 mins at 500g.
  7. Based on cell count, use c1V1=c2V2 to determine amount of biogel required.
  8. Using a 5 mL syringe, stir biogel and draw up required amount and transfer to sterile specimen jar.
  9. Remove supernatant from cells, resuspend in media (~30uL / mL of biogel). Transfer to biogel in jar with a 1mL pipette, slowly stirring into ink as you do. Make sure to get into tip of cartridge and that it entirely incorporated (~1.5 min).
  10. Draw up into a syringe and add to anchor moulds in a 24WP.
  11. Add CaCl2 solution (100mM) to drops and crosslink for 15 mins.
  12. Following crosslink, remove scaffolds with anchor moulds to a 6 well plate.
  13. Wash scaffolds in media at RT according to this:
    1. 1x 1 min wash
    2. 1x 5 min wash
    3. x 10 min wash at 37 C
  14. After scaffolds are washed of all excess CaCl2, culture in media.
  15. Leave for 1 day prior to feeding to ensure stabilisation of construct.
  16. Feed according to schedule.

Cell Seeding Protocol - FOR PORK BUN CONSTRUCTS

Preparing pork buns

  1. Using a sterile biopsy punch cut 1cm wide cylinders from sterilised "pork bun" plugs. 
  2. Rehydrate in media for 24 hrs (Exact time to be determined)

Seeding

  1. Add growth factors to the growth media. 
  2. Place growth media aliquot in the waterbath (37C) for minimum 20 minutes
  3. Bring other reagents and biogel to RT for 1 hour. 
  4. Perform cell count. Density for experiments: 20 million cells / mL (required density to be proven). 
  5. Passage cells. Put required cell volume into 50mL centrifuge tubes.
  6. Centrifuge cell suspension for 5 mins at 500g.
  7. Based on cell count, determine how many cells are required using a density of 6 million cells / cm2 (equivalent to 20 million cells per 1cm wide by 0.5cm high cylinder).
  8. For crosslinked conditions: Crosslink rehydrated "pork bun" scaffolds with calcium chloride (100mM) for 15 mins on shaker platform in 6 WP or 70mL specimen jar. 
    1. Wash scaffolds in media at RT according to this:
      1. 1x 1 min wash
      2. 1x 5 min wash
      3. x 10 min wash
    2. After scaffolds are washed of all excess CaCl2, place in media at culture conditions. .
  9. For non-crosslinked conditions: Place rehydrated "pork bun" scaffolds into media in 6WP.
  10. Resuspend required cell volume into 3mL per pork bun scaffold and pipette onto rehydrated pork bun scaffolds.
  11. Culture on shaking platform for 5 mins followed by static culture for 25 mins. Repeat this 4 times. Followed by continuous static culture (This seeding method is under investigation)
  12. Leave for 1 day prior to feeding to ensure stabilisation of construct.
  13. Feed according to schedule.

Feeding Schedule

Everyday feeds

  1. Take 3 images at 5x and 3 images at 10x
  2. Check for signs of contamination.
  3. Remove 50% of media and replace with 50% fresh media every day.

Every second day feeds

  1. Take 3 images at 5x and 3 images at 10x
  2. Check for signs of contamination.
  3. Remove 50% of media and replace with 50% fresh media every second day.

Staining Protocol

Hoechst 33342 /Propidium Iodide

  1. Transfer scaffolds to to a 24 WP on days 0, 3, 7
  2. Remove any excess media.
  3. Add in fresh media with 2 ug/mL of Hoechst and 2 ug/mL Propidium Iodide.
  4. Incubate for 15 mins on a shaker plate.
  5. Remove media and wash 2x with PBS.
  6. Replace with fresh PBS and image on Zaber.
