Process for feed

  1. Took images of each flask and recorded observations in the table below. 
  2. Growth media pre-warmed to 37C, by placing in the water bath for >15min.
  3. Cultures removed from the incubator and placed in the BSC
  4. 50% of the growth media removed from each vessel (6mL)
  5. Media replaced with 6mL of each cultures growth medium
  6. Returned to the cell culture incubator, Library Lab #138, 37C and 5% CO2.  
  




Cultures in serum free media imaged and observations recorded in the table
below.

with senescent morpholog (enlarged nuclei + cytoplasm, vacuoles).
