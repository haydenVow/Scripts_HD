Total media required: 30mL

Total p38i required: 15uL

Process:

1\.  Placed   30mL  mL of  Growth Media in  1 x 50 mL   tube(s) into BSC.
Added 15uL of P38i to aliquot.

Placed in water bath  10:20am  

2\. Stopped the shaker and removed cultures from the incubator before
restarting the shaker   10:39am  

3\. Placed suspension flask(s) inside the BSC and allowed to sit static for
3-5 minutes to allow microcarriers to settle to the base of the flask.

2\. Carefully removed  50  % of supernatant from the flask(s) by pipetting
slowly and following the meniscus with the pipette tip so as to avoid placing
the pipette tip near the microcarriers at the base of the flask(s).

3\. Replaced with  30 mL (per well/per vessel) of   growth  media.

4\. Returned vessel to incubate at:   10:50am    , incubator #  68   , ensured
the shaker was shaking at 110rpm.

  * [x]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (aviary cells)
