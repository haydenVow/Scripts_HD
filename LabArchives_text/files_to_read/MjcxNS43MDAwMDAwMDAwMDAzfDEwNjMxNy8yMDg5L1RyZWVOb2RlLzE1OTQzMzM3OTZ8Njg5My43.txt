We will be using the Clubhouse roadmap function to structure and track
deliverables.

Our team tag will be "Project Maturation"

Main MILESTONES will be the 2 key results with a substructure of EPICS

proposed EPIC ideas

  1. all must contribute to us achieving our objective!
  2. Who is on what?
  3. when to start each and when to finish
  4. need to get more biological results and faster!

  

  

  1.  EPIC: Electrical stim 
    1. prototyping the lid, design
    2. commercial systems
  2. EPIC: DOE HTS 
    1. for incoming scaffolds
    2. ECM sheets from fibros
  3. EPIC: DSD for media components
    1. includes lit research portion  

  4. EPIC: Mechanical stim (passive)
    1. morrocan claypot shaped well inserts with variable angle
    2. pillars with collagen solution using fibros (inject at 4 C, gels at 37 C) 
    3. order more collagen solution, thrombin etc
  5. EPIC: Tool development 
    1. Transparent bottom cups for HTS screening
    2. Myotube alignment tool
    3. ELISA improvements
      1. using primary cells
      2. includes OT integration for washes etc
  6. EPIC: Big scale reactor improvements
    1. better pot (flat bottom, glass? or can we go with stainless steel until we get E-stim to work?)
    2. better lid (UV-sterilizable, so can use acrylic with grooves for silicone seal, lasercut holes for ports, can even tap to properly interface with Luer and commercial threads, can also glue to multilayer
