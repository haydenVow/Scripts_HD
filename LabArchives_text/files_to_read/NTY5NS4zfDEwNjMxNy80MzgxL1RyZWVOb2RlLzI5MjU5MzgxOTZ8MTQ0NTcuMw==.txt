Total number of wells per plate = 8 x 5 = ~100

Total number of plates = 4

Total number of wells = 400

Total gelatin volume required (coat all the wells to minimise evaporation in
the incubator) = 50 uL x 400 wells = 20 mL (+ 10% = 22 mL)

Total growth media required = 40 wells x 4 plates x 200 uL (working volume for
96-WP) x 1.2 (excess factor) + the media for pellet resuspension =~ 40 mL

Volume of tryple required = 10 mL (from the table above)

Total volume of dPBS required = 10 mL (to wash the growth media in the wells)
+ 10 mL to neutralise the tryple = 20 mL

  




### Process:

1\. Took image of vessel with microscope on phase setting.

2\. Gelatin coated     4     x    96-WP      vessel with sterile filtered 0.1%
gelatin solution and then incubated all coated flasks at 37˚C.

  1. Time when all vessels(s) placed into the incubator       11:12  am 

3\. Aliquotted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then
placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath for a minimum of 20 minutes
prior to use:

  1. TrypLE:     10    mL in     1 x 15mL    tube
  2.  dPBS (for neutralising):     10    mL
  3.  dPBS (for washing):      10   mL
  4. Growth media (for pellet resuspension + seeding):     40    mL

Time that all aliquots were placed in the water bath the warm before use
1:17  pm

Note: if aliquots were placed in water bath at different time, record the time
stamp for each individual solution.




4\. Removed vessel(s) from the incubator     1:50  pm

5\. Washed the vessel(s) with dPBS (warmed).

6\. Added    10     mL tryple to each vessel/well and incubated at 37˚C.

  1. Start/Finish for TrypLE was     2:09 - 2:25  pm 

7\. Neutralised with     10     dPBS and combined cell suspension into a
50 mL    tube.

8\. Centrifuged at 650 x g for 5 min.

  1. Start/Finish time for centrifugation was   2:31 - 2:36  pm 




9\. Aspirated the supernatant(s).

11\. Aliquoted     10 uL     of resuspended cells into a microcentrifuge tube
for cell count.

12\. Performed a cell count using the haemocytometer and recorded the cell
count data in the Google Doc spreadsheet: Cell Count Spreadsheet or cell count
widget below

  1. Total cell number was:      452,000       

  2. Volume of cell suspension required for subculture was:      0.272 mL       

  3. Cell density per vessel:     640 cells / well       




13\. Transferred       272    µl of cell suspension to the pre-warmed
38.13    mL Growth media:

14\. Transferred cell suspension into the pre-gelatin coated       4x 96-WP
vessel.

15\. Left at RT in the BSC for 30 min to allow cells to settle      4:30  \-
5:00 pm  

16\. Transferred vessel(s) to incubate at:

  * [X]  37ºC @ 5:00 pm, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (avian cells)
