Day -1: Setup bioreactor and perform sterility test  
StepTaskDescriptionReferenceDoneChecked  
23Calibrate peristaltic pumps  
  
  
  
  
24Transport the sterile bioreactor vessel to the work benchOnce the
autoclaving chamber has cooled to 60-70 deg C, open the chamber and check
connections to make sure that all vessels remain sealed. In the event that any
tubing has popped off, rinse connections with 70% ethanol and reconnect; or,
re-autoclave the entire assembly. Use a trolley to transport the assembly to
the work bench.Operating manual page(s) 70

33Fill adjustment agent bottlesIf not autoclaved inside the vessels, dispense
the adjustment agents using a sterile filling process.https://www.infors-

Operating manual page(s) 70, 77  
  
  
35Prime the feed tubesFill the corrective reagent tubes. If the tubes are not
filled with the appropriate reagent, the control unit may malfunction, because
it will initially feed air into the culture vessel instead of liquid reagent.  
Set the totaliser to 0 after priming all tubes.https://www.infors-

36Add the culture mediumUse the "SUBS-A" pump as it is the fastest. Pump out
the waste liquid and add fresh growth medium  
  
  
  
37Turn on the gas supply to the control tower

38Set the air flow rateEnsure that the line is unclamped to the air inlet. Set
to 0.05 L/minhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3864403/

Extra notes:

Set SUBS-A setpoint to 0 before calibration.

Check foil wrapped pieces to feel if they have popped off during autoclaving.

Inspect screws and attachments for loose pieces

Ensure the exhaust filter incrementor has been checked off after autoclaving

Stir tank bioreactor: Lowest working volume = 1/3 of the maximum working
volume.

Connect up your autoclaved bottles before the heating blanket

O rings on autoclaved schott bottles may be sticky, When fixing the autoclaved
bioreactor lids to the schott bottle ensure lid detaches easily. otherwise
transfer the contents of your innoculum to the autoclaved schott bottle.

Anything bottles containing liquids going into the culture should be connected
to the multiport on the top of the reactor.

The arrows below each pump on the biostat A indicate the flow of liquid once
the tubes are connected.

Heating blanket is orange. Smooth side to the glass, foam side facing out. Try
not to cover the volume measurements on the side of the glass.

Make sure you've unclamped all your lines after everything is connected.

Anti-foam and base lines should always go to anti-foam and base pump
respectively because they are automatically controlled.

Don't connect microcarrier containing innoculum to the multiport, it will
block the tube.

Need to add steps for configuring pH control in base pump and CO2.

Need to add steps for exhaust heater.
