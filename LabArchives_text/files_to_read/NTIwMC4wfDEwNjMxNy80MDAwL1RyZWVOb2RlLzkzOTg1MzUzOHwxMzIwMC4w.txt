Prepare materials for thaw and seed:

2\. Aliquotted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then
placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath for a minimum of 20 minutes
prior to use:

  *  Growth media (for seeding):   2x 30 mL 
  * Time that aliquot was placed in the water bath to warm before use:   13:20   \-        

  




## Thaw and seed vial:

3\. Collected the cryovial from Liquid Nitrogen storage & place in foam
floater in water bath for 5 min  14:13 - 14:18  

Location where cryovial was collected from:

Vial details:  1  cryovials at  1 million  cells

Tower/Bucket #2  

Box/Cane #2  

Vial location: C9

`4. Ethanol sprayed & transferred the vial(s) to the BSC.`

`5.  Added  500 µL of Growth Media (to generate a total volume of 1mL in the
cryovial) to the cryovial, resuspended the cell suspension gently to reduce
osmotic shock. `

`6. Collected the entire 1mL of cell suspension & transfer into the pre-warmed
tube of ~30mL Growth Media. `

`7. Used this cell suspension to seed half of a 384 wp (column 1-12) with
70uL/well.`

`8. Diluted 10mL from the remaining cell suspension into 30mL more of growth
media (i.e. 1 in 4 dilution). Used this to seed the other half of a 384 wp
with 70uL/well.  
`

`9. Transfered flask/plate(s) to incubate at:  14:50  
`

  * [X]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (aviary cells)

  

Making labels

Note - You will need to increase the passage number by one. (i.e. if your
thawed vial ID has a passage number of 3, when you make a culture ID for you
vessel you will need change the passage number to 4 on Airtable.)

  




SOPs used:

  * Thaw/Revival Template_V3

  

Summary:

Thawed F_DOLLY12 and seeded 1x 384 wp (half with high cell density, half with
low).
