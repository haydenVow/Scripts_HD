### Process:

1\. Took image of vessel with microscope on phase setting.

2\. Gelatin coated  4  x  T25 , 2  x  T75 ,   1  x  T175  vessel with sterile
filtered 0.1% gelatin solution and then incubated all coated flasks at 37˚C.

  1. Time when all vessels(s) placed into the incubator     18-Jan-21 at 11:55 am 

3\. Aliquotted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then
placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath for a minimum of 20 minutes
prior to use:

  1. TrypLE:   4   mL in   1   tubes
  2.  dPBS (for neutralising):   2 x 2 mL
  3.  dPBS (for washing):   4  mL
  4. Growth media (for pellet resuspension):   1 x 12mL (for MuSC portion) and 4mL (fibros)  mL
  5. Growth media (for seeding):   30mL (for fibroblasts)   mL 

Time that all aliquots were placed in the bead bath to warm at 37C before use
9:40 am

Note: if aliquots were placed in water bath at different time, record the time
stamp for each individual solution.




4\. Removed vessel(s) from the incubator   9:55 am

5\. Washed the vessel(s) with dPBS (warmed).

6\. Added   2  mL tryple to each vessel/well and incubated at 37˚C.

  1. Start/Finish for TrypLE was   9:58 am 

7\. Neutralised with   2mL   dPBS and combined cell suspension into a   15mL
tube each.

8\. Centrifuged at 650 x g for 5 min.

  1. Start/Finish time for centrifugation was   10:14 - 10:19  am 




9\. Aspirated the supernatant(s).

10\. Resuspended MuSC pellet in    12     mL     Growth media (incl 10uM p38i)
media   10:22 am

Transferred the MuSC suspension into 1 x non-coated 100mm culture dish. Left
in incubator at 37C for 45 mins 10:27 - 11:12 am

10\. Resuspended Fibroblast pellet in    2     mL     Growth media      media
10:30 am

11\. Aliquoted     10uL     of resuspended fibroblast cells into a
microcentrifuge tube for cell count.

12\. Performed a cell count using the haemocytometer and recorded the cell
count data in the Google Doc spreadsheet: Cell Count Spreadsheet or cell count
widget below. Cell count added to doublings calculator to track the doublings
time in days
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1kiVXcsre8aDPtA9DjQ84WzN0dLb7jrzD9GehzExe7Ng/edit?usp=sharing

  1. Total cell number was:       1,600,000    
  2. Volume of cell suspension required for subculture was:     2mL        

  3. Cell density per vessel:    >7,000 cells / cm2       




FIBROBLAST SEEDING:

13\. Transferred    2mL  of cell suspension to the pre-warmed    30 mL Growth
media:    10:49 am

14\. Transferred cell suspension into the non-gelatin coated    T175
vessel.

15\. Left at RT in the BSC for 30 min to allow cells to settle     10:51  \-
11:21 am  

16\. Transferred vessel(s) to incubate at:

  * [ X ]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (avian cells)

  

MuSC SEEDING (after pre-plate):

1\. Transferred supernatant from 100mm plate into 1 x gelatin-coated T75
flask.

2\. Allow to sit at RT in the BSC for 30 min to allow cells to settle 11:25 -
11:55 am  

16\. Transferred vessel(s) to incubate at:

  * [ X ]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (avian cells)




Observations/Summary:

F_KUZCO20 fibroblasts expanded from 1 well of 1 x 6-well plate into 1 x T175
flask

KUZCO20 MuSC (mixture) harvested, pre-plated in a 100mm plate, and then
supernatant was seeded into 1 x gelatin-coated T75 flask
