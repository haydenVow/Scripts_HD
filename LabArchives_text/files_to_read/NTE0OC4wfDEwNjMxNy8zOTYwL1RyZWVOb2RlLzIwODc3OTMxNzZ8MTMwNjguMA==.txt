### Process:

For feeds: Heat the following to 30C in the water bath

1. 30mL DMEM + 20% FBS + 1 x PS (for cultures 7999 and 8002)  
2. 9mL M199 + 20% FBS + 1 x PS (for cultures 8001, 8000 and 8003)  

For Passage: Heat the following to 30C in the water bath

  1. TrypLE:     15  mL in      1   tubes
  2.  dPBS (for neutralising):     15 mL
  3.  dPBS (for washing):       15 mL
  4. DMEM + 20% FBS + 1 x PS for pellet resuspension):     5   mL
  5. DMEM + 20% FBS + 1 x PS  for seeding     90    

Time that all aliquots were placed in the water bath the warmed to 30C before
use   11:31  

Note: if aliquots were placed in water bath at different time, record the time
stamp for each individual solution.




Feed  
1\. 50% media removed from each vessel  
2 Replaced with 50% respective fresh media (see table below)  
3\. Returned to cell culture incubator #77, 5% CO2, 30C. 11:52




Passage and freeze  

  1.  Removed vessel(s) 7973 and 7972 from the incubator   11:54   

  2. Washed the vessel(s) with dPBS (warmed).
  3. Added 10ml (T175) and 5mL (T75) tryple to each vessel/well and incubated at 30ËšC.
  4. Start/Finish for TrypLE was     12:00-12:10  

  5. Neutralised each with with   dPBS (equal to volume of tryple) and transferred to   15 mL    tubes.
  6. Centrifuged at 650 x g for 5 min.
  7. Start/Finish time for centrifugation was   12:15-12:20  

  8. Aspirated the supernatant(s).
  9. Resuspended pellet(s) in   5  mL   growth   media
  10.  Aliquoted   30uL  of resuspended cells into a microcentrifuge tube for cell count.
  11. Performed a cell count using the haemocytometer and recorded the cell count data in the Google Doc spreadsheet called 'Cell Count Spreadsheet' (see link below):

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1DPzKubYxfHmWogVPihC-
SSIBtIylyrBQE5kRX5Z8NtI/edit#gid=0  
  

    1. Total cell count was: approximately 11.0M cells
    2. Re-seeded approximately 5M cells into 4x T175 flasks, giving a seeding density of 7K/cm 
    3.   

    1. 13\. Incubate at 30C and 5% CO2. 13:000
    2. The remaining cells were frozen as described bellow  







Cryo-preservation of cells

Because so many cells were harvested, it was decided to bank some cells as an
MCB. When we thawed a vial of CHOMP homogenate last recently, it took over 10
days for them to adhere to the the culture vessel and these cells have not
been proliferating well. To assess the affects of freezing protocols on these
cells, the cells banked today were frozen in 1 of 3 freeze medias. 2 vials of
500K cells were frozen in each freeze medium type. Note: a small amount of
cell suspension was lost due to the pippete tip falling off onto the bench, so
I was only able to freeze the 9x  vials at 500K each.

1\. Cryosofree (DMSO free cryostor)  
2\. Cryostor standard  
3\. FBS +10 % DMSO

1\. 3x 1.5M cell suspension was transferred into 3x 15M tubes 13:20  
2\. Centrifuged at 650g for 5min 13:30-13:35  
3\. Resuspended cell pellet in one of the above medias for each tube  
4\. Transferred to cryovials in 500ul cell suspensions (500k cells/vial)  
5\. Placed in Mr Freeze, 4th freeze, with foam, and placed in -80C freezer
13:50
