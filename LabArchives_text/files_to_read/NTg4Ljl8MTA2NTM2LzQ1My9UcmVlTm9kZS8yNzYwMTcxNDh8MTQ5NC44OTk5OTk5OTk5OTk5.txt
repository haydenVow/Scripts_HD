Notes made by: Michael Medynskyj

Post-confluent treatment group flasks were observed for signs of
peeling/aggregation

Flask 7981 (10CS): no peeling so far at all  
Flask  7982 (10CS): 2 or 3 layers showing early signs of peeling)  
Flask  7983 (2CF): both layers showing peeling - more so than the 10CS

Will leave all flasks for harvest tomorrow or even later if the first 10CS
doesn't show any signs of peeling and the 7982 10CS appears the same as today
