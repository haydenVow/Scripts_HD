### Step 3: Secondary stain cells with ELISA and fluorescent secondary
antibodies

1\. Added 150uL of secondary antibody mix to respective wells in order to
fully submerge scaffolds in antibody solutions.

Incubated respective wells with corresponding secondary antibody mixtures in
the dark at RT for 1 hour.    12:01  -  12:57  a/pm  
  
From this step onwards protect from the light by wrapping plates in foil and
perform experiment in the dark




### Step 3: Enzymatic reaction (TMB substrate conversion)

Please note critical steps to ELISA workflow are highlighted in
bold/underlined.

  1. Removed 2nd antibody solution.     13:00   a/pm    
  2. Washed in   200uL   dPBS 5 times for 5 min at RT in the dark. (No Triton)  
  13:04 a/pm  
  13:08 a/pm  
  13:10 a/pm  
  13:14 a/pm  
  13:16 a/pm  
  3. Started peroxidase reaction by adding  100uL  of TMB substrate solution to respective wells and incubated plate at RT for 15 mins.  
  13:23  \-  13:38  a/pm  
  4. Quenched reaction with an equal volume of 0.5 M HCl or     100uL   STRICTLY after 15 minutes and observed cyan to yellow colour change.
  5. Pipette mixed and transferred   100uL   of the yellow supernatant to a non-treated 96 well plate.  
Do not use a cell culture treated 96 well plate!  
If continuing with Janus Green stain, wash original plate immediately with PBS
(see Janus Green staining template for more detail)

  6. Spun down plate in centrifuge for 1 min at 1000 rpm to remove bubbles and droplets.
  7. Placed plate in NanoStar plate reader and measured absorbance values at 450nm (ELISA 405 preset program).
