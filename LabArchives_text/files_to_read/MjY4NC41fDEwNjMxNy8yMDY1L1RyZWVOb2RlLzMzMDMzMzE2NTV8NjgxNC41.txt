Prepare materials for thaw and seed:

1\. Gelatin coated  4  x  T25  flasks/plates with sterile filtered 0.1%
gelatin solution and then incubated all coated flasks at 37ºC

  * Time when all flasks placed into the incubator   8 : 49 am 

2\. Aliquotted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then
placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath for a minimum of 20 minutes
prior to use:

  *  Growth media (for seeding):    30mL and 20mL  in  2  tubes 
  * Time that aliquot was placed in the water bath to warm before use:   9:15 am

## Thaw and seed vial:

3\. Collected the cryovial from Liquid Nitrogen storage & place in foam
floater in water bath for 5 min  10:40  \- 10:45  

Location where cryovial was collected from:

Vial details:  1  cryovials at   540 K  cells

Brew

Tower/Bucket #1  

Box/Cane #1  

Vial location: B2  

Vial ID(s):2210-Culture-6066-Vial-11of74

`4. Ethanol sprayed & transferred the vial(s) to the BSC.`

`5.  Added  500 µL of Growth Media (to generate a total volume of 1mL in the
cryovial) to the cryovial, resuspended the cell suspension gently to reduce
osmotic shock. Aliquoted 10uL aside for a cell count.  
`

`6. Collected the remaining ~1mL of cell suspension & transferred into 30mL of
warm Growth Media. `

`7. Performed a cell count using a haemocytometer.`

`Total cell count was:`

`100k cells = 4.7 mL  
`

`8. Transfered   5 mL to each pre-coated  4x T25  flasks, allow to rest in the
BSC at RT for 30 min  10:08 - 10:38 a/pm `

`9. Transfered flask/plate(s) to incubate at: `

  * [X]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (aviary cells)

  

Making labels

Note - You will need to increase the passage number by one. (i.e. if your
thawed vial ID has a passage number of 3, when you make a culture ID for you
vessel you will need change the passage number to 4 on Airtable.)

  




SOPs used:

  * Thaw/Revival Template_V3

  

Summary:

Thawed DOLLY12 WCB MuSc into 4x T25 flasks (1000 cells/cm^2)




### Results:

  * Results were;
    * [X]  As Usual (this is a repetitive task)
    * [ ]  Unexpected because...
    * [ ]  Need to be further analysed
    * [ ]  Other (.......)
