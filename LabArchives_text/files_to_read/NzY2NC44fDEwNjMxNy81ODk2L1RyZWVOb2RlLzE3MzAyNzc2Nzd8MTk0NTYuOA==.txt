1\. Aliquotted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then
placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath for a minimum of 20 minutes
prior to use:

  *  Growth media (for seeding):    30 mL   

  * Time that aliquot was placed in the water bath to warm before use:  15:17   

  




## Thaw and seed vial:

3\. Collected the cryovial from Liquid Nitrogen storage & place in foam
floater in water bath for 5 min : - :

Location where cryovial was collected from:

Vial details:  1   x  CHO-S  cryovials at   10M  cells each for a total of
10M  cells

Tower/Bucket # 2

Box/Cane # 7  

Vial location: G6  

Vial ID(s): 3780-Culture-9419-Vial-1of9  

`4. Ethanol sprayed & transferred the vial(s) to the BSC.`

`5.  Added  500 µL of Growth Media (to generate a total volume of 1.5 mL in
the cryovial) to the cryovial, resuspended the cell suspension gently to
reduce osmotic shock. `

`6. Collected the entire 1.5 mL of cell suspension & transfer into the pre-
warmed tube of Growth Media. `

`7. Using a 10mL serological pipette, resuspended & distributed the cells
evenly in the  1x 30 mL aliquots of pre-warmed Growth Media (prepared in Step
2). `

``

`8. Transfered flask/plate(s) to incubate at: `

  * [x]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (aviary cells)

  

Making labels

Note - You will need to increase the passage number by one. (i.e. if your
thawed vial ID has a passage number of 3, when you make a culture ID for you
vessel you will need change the passage number to 4 on Airtable.)
