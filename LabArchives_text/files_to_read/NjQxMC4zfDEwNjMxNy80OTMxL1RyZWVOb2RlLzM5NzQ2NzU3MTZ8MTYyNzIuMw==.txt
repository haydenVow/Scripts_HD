Prepare materials for thaw and seed:

1\. Aliquoted:

  * Growth medium (for re-suspending and counting cells):  5 mL in 1 x 15 mL tube 
  * Growth medium (for seeding):   85 mL in 1 x 70 mL sterile urine container  
    * Time that aliquots were placed in the water bath (set to 30ºC) to warm before use:   15:05  a/pm 

  




## Thaw and seed vial

2\. Collected the cryovials from LN2 storage & place in foam floater in water
bath for MAXIMUM 5 min    15:22 - 15:25 a/pm

Location where cryovials were collected from:

Vial details: 2 x  F_CHOMP09 cryovials at 2M cells each for a total of 4M
cells

Brew

Tower/Bucket # 5

Box/Cane # 5

Vial location: B1, B2

Vial ID(s): 3611-Culture-8616-Vial-1of23, 3612-Culture-8616-Vial-2of23

3\. Ethanol sprayed & transferred the vial(s) to the BSC.

5\. Added 500 µL of Growth Medium from 5 mL aliquot (to generate a total
volume of 1 mL in the cryovial) to each cryovial, resuspended the cell
suspensions gently to reduce osmotic shock.

6\. Collected the entire 1 mL of both cell suspensions & transferred into the
pre-warmed tube 5 mL aliquot of Growth Medium

7\. Re-suspended cell suspension with a 5 mL serelogical pipette, then took 1
x 10 uL sample for cell count (note that total volume for cell count will be 6
mL due to 500 uL being added from each thawed vial to the 5 mL growth medium
aliquot)

  * Cell count:3,024,000    

8\. Using a 5 mL serological pipette, resuspended & moved 6 mL cell suspension
to pre-warmed  85 mL growth medium aliquot (creating a 91 mL cell suspension).
Note: perform 1 - 2 washes of 15 mL tube with ~ 5 mL of 91 mL cell suspension
to ensure all cells have been moved.

9\. Transferred 10 mL of  91 mL cell suspension to each 100 mm plate

10\. Transfered plates to incubate at: 16:23

  * [ ]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (avian cells)
  * [X] 30ºC, 5% CO2 (reptilian cells)

  

Making labels

Note - You will need to increase the passage number by one. (i.e. if your
thawed vial ID has a passage number of 3, when you make a culture ID for you
vessel you will need change the passage number to 4 on Airtable.)
