The top 25 method in the round three analysis set was considered to be the
best run conditions.  The two injections (each of 240ng total protein) were
analysed individually and combined via either Max Quant for iBAQ or Top3
quantitation or via Proteome Discoverer and Mascot for emPAI quantitation.
Excel files of each analysis are attached to this page.

The two Top 25 replicates were searched using MaxQuant vr 2.0.3 vs the merino
sheep proteome.  The settings included:

In parallel with the MQ (iBAQ) search, the data set was also searched using PD
2.5 and Mascot 2.8

To obtain the emPIA report, the Mascot report for each search was download,
and then the proteins ranked on the emPIA score. The top10 were:
