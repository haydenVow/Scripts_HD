Main lab fridge (74) - 1L bottle with a white cap that says 10C Sun  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  




Reagent preparation

1\. Aliquotted   900 mL  mL of  Growth Media into  1L bottle     tube(s).
Placed in water bath  10 : 30 am (once waterbath had reached 37'C)




Cell factory Process

  1. Unscrew white cap and remove blue cap and place aside.
  2. Removed  `50`  % of supernatant (150 mL) from 1 x 2CF by carefully pouring into a waste container with 300mL marked.
  3. Replaced with  `150` mL (per flask) of  `growth`   media by carefully pouring media through the white cap opening (alternatively you may use a 50mL serological to add media.)
  4. Place caps back and equalize 2CF by placing it on its side (blue cap on the bottom and white cap on the top, see image below:)  
  

4\. Returned vessel to incubate at 11:20:

  * [x]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (aviary cells)

  

  * [x]  Thermo Incubator (ID #13)
  * [ ]  Top Sanyo Incubator (ID #25)
  * [ ]  Bottom Sanyo Incubator
  * [ ]  Top Binder Incubator
  * [ ]  Bottom Binder Incubator
