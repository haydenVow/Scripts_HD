Purpose: Establish our co-culture R&D branch at Vow.

Project Lead: Katie Bashant Day  
Strategic Second: Chris O'Keefe  
Primary Team: Bec, Adrian, Derek

Desired outcome: Have a defined process to get fused and maturing myotubes on
a broader range of scaffolds

Goal: Produce a co-culture product which facilitates sustained adherence of
fibroblasts & MuSCs to achieve >70% scaffold coverage and >30% fusion of MuSCs

Milestone 1:  
A) Establish a WCB for fibroblasts  
B) Establish culture of at least 1 cell type additional to MuSCs and or
Fibroblasts.

Key Result 1: Have a defined process for isolating and culturing three
different cell types

Milestone 2:  
A) Establish a WCB for our 3rd cell type  
B) Demonstrate that co-culture improves sustained adherence of MuSCs beyond
monoculture.

Key Result 2: Demonstrate the utility of the co-culture platform by improving
short and long-term MuSC adherence to scaffolds above mono-culture

Milestone 3: Demonstrate that co-culture improves differentiation and/or
maturation of MuSCs beyond monoculture.

Key Result 3: Demonstrate the utility of the co-culture platform by improving
the rate and extent of differentiation and fusion above mono-culture
