Growth Media:

  * [X]  E6

Total media required: 10mL

  

  




Process:

  

Placed aliquotted   10mL  mL of  E6 into in water bath   07:14 a/pm

2\. Removed   150 uL of Growth media from columns 3-10.

3\. Replaced with  150 uL (per well/per vessel) of  E6   media.

4\. Returned vessel to incubate at 07:38am:

  * [X]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (aviary cells)

  

  * [X]  Thermo Incubator (ID #13)
  * [ ]  Top Sanyo Incubator (ID #25)
  * [ ]  Bottom Sanyo Incubator
  * [ ]  Top Binder Incubator
  * [ ]  Bottom Binder Incubator




### Observations/Summary:

 100 % media changed on vessel(s)

  1. Plates were examined under the Axio microscope to find that "ramping" seeding density tactic had worked. Columns 3-10 have increasingly higher cell numbers as desired originally.
