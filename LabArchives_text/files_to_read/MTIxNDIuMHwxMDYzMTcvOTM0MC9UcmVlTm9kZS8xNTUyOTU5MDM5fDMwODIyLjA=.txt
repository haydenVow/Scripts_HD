Key findings


  * Sum up the results and the meaning of the findings as succinctly as possible into bullet points, this could be a short paragraph or a single line. Copy this to your Header Info pages under the Result Summary section.  
  
  

  * If the experiment was unsuccessful, don't over-complicate the results. Concisely explain why it was not successful and add any key learnings/optimisations that will be taken forward.  
  
Why? Key findings are surmised at the very top of the report page to quickly
provide the reader with the main take-aways from the work and whether or not
the aim was was achieved.


Introduction


It is useful for the reader to see a brief re-cap section on what the purpose
of the experiment was and why so that it is clear whether this has been met or
not when reading the discussion.

*Note the implications for the findings (i.e. how do the findings fit into our final goal of producing an edible meat product) and the potential reasons that the results might have worked out this way. 

**Justify your interpretations of the findings (reference literature or
previous experiments here). Do not state interpretations as fact.  
  
*** Be critical, are there any competing factors that may have interfered with
the experiment and influenced the results? If so, state them and explain their
potential impact on the perceived results. This may tie into the future work
section (ways to improve the experimental design to mitigate those risks).  
  
**** Discuss any limitations that may have impacted the work - explain their
potential impact on the results and how that affects your interpretation.  
  
****Note any changes made to improve the experimental outcomes or mitigate
risk.  
  
It may be useful to refer to the following guide on academic/scientific
writing when writing up an experiment report.

Why? This section prompts us to understand why our results turned out a
certain way and subsequently may provide crucial insight on how we can improve
outcomes and better inform our future research efforts.


Future work


Provide a short paragraph or bullet points indicating what experiments (if
any) will be completed as a direct result of this experiment e.g. repeats, new
conditions, troubleshooting etc and if relevant what would be improved upon
for next time to strengthen findings and/or mitigate risks. Where possible set
a timeline for this work and who will lead the work.

Why? This section allows us to effectively pick up the work where it was left
off, while benefiting from previous learnings so that mistakes are not
repeated.
