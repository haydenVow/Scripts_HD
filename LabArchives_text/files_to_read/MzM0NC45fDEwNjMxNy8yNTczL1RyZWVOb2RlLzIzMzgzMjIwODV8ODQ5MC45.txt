The preparation of Konjac gels was attempted in house using Konjac powder from
SIGMA and food grade curdlan, however, despite these efforts we were unable to
form solid gels (see previous entry). As a result, preformed commercial
options were used.  
  
The first commercial Konjac sample was brought from Tongli Supermarket (see
ingredient list below) and the second sample provided by Ella purchased from
Miracle Supermarket in the Marrickville metro (consisted of Konjac and 5%
curdlan).
