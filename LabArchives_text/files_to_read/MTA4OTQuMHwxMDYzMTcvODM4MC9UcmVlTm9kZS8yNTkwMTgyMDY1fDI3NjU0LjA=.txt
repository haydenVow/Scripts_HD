Note

The centrifuge at Co-Labs Melbourne is an old, swing rotor centrifuge. It has
dials to select spin time and speed however these are not precise. The
centrifugation speed dial ranged from 1-10 with 10 being top speed (see image
below for speed control settings and equivalent spin speed in RPM).




Conversion of RPM to G (for 50mL tubes)  
  
The following conversion table is base upon the assumption that the router
diameter is 13.2cm (extrapolated from the conversion written on the top of the
machine). The top speed (setting 10) used for the calculation does not match
the graph however. I've assumed that they wrote the wrong setting number but
that conversion equation used was correct (indicating a rotor radius of
13.2cm) and that the graph is a good reflection of the RPM for each setting.
