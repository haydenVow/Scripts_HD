Aim/Purpose


To generate mature muscle tissues from myoblast cultures using a tissue
engineering approach. At the same time, we will be developing an ACF media
formulation to enhance muscle differentiation and maturation.


Hypothesis


Tissue engineered muscle constructs can provide fibrous texture to a product
prototype, through better replicating the composition of mature muscle.


Technical Gap


We have not yet found a successful approach to produce mature tissue structure
through tissue-engineering, which has the capacity to be scaled, both in size
and scale. Nor have we yet been able to generate effective ACF media
formulations for the growth and differentiation of myoblasts in culture. This
prototype programme will aim to produce mature tissues first, while at the
same time optimising myoblast growth and differentiation conditions


Method/Procedure


This prototype programme methods will be split into 3 streams:

  1. Tissue engineering
    1. Scaffold-based muscle tissue engineering to produce mature muscle tissue
    2. Identifying and testing ACF matrices (i.e. synthetic) for use in tissue-engineering
    3. Scaffold-free encapsulation of myoblasts into spheres (pioneered by James Henstock and Victoria Prior in First Product Program)
  2. Development of an ACF component free media formulation
    1. For Myoblast differentiation through use of small molecule inhibitors
    2. For Myoblast maintenance 
  3. Scale-up capacity of tissue engineering
    1. Methods for producing > 50g
