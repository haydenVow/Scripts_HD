Additional Support:

Desired outcome: Move the differentiation and maturation process into a
scalable vessel and increase total protein yield ten-fold

  

Goal: To produce two scalable prototype reactors and identify at least two new
factors that promote fusion and myotube growth to double total protein yield

Milestone 1 (April):

  1. Decide on the 2 most promising factors that promote fusion or maturation
  2. Keep cells alive in a v1 reactor prototype with 10x the surface area of a current science experiment (~100 cm2)

Milestone 2 (May):

  1. Measure maturation baseline in current RnD format and v1 prototype
  2. Build a v2 reactor that includes perfusion (media exchange) and improves fusion or maturation

Milestone 3 (June):

  1. Implement electrical stimulation or other promising factor and assess impact on fusion/maturation
  2. Deploy latest version bioreactor into production

  




# Current prototype highlights (v2b aka WASHe)

contained (waterbath with sous vide and gas perfusion) with pH and DO probes
(during testing)

main material: glass with steel lid

lid: yes, with 2 ports for sensors, 2 ports for media in/out, 2 ports for gas
in/out

Perfusion: YES (for media change), otherwise stirred

volume: 2-4 L

culture surface area (theoretical based on current shelf design): unknown
