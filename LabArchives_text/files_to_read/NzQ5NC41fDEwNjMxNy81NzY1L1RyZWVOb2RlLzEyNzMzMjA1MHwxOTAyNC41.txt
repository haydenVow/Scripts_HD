RELATED TO MILESTONE:  KR3 - Investigate the (nutritional/culinary) benefits
of mature muscle

AIM/PURPOSE: To investigate which nutrients/mineral are unique to animal
meat/muscle and relevant to Vow from a product perspective. To identify
analytical techniques to analyze samples (ideally in house) to create a
baseline for selected compounds.

HYPOTHESIS: n/a

RESULTS SUMMARY:

  * A comprehensive review of muscle-specific nutrient was generate in Notion (see below)
    * the review includes a detailed description of each nutrients role, biology, suggests suitable analytical techniques and further resources
  * B12, myoglobin, creatine and carnosine were identified as compounds unique to muscle tissue/cells. These compounds were also of interest from a nutritional perspective and will be further investigated
  * Assays for B12 and Creatine were purchased and experiments planned to validate these methods in house. 
  * Total protein analysis methods were developed in house to measure overall protein content (Bradford, BCA)
  * Almost 30 samples were sent for proteomic profiling as well as lipidomics

  

CONCLUSIONS:

Pursuing myoblast maturation studies is a worthwhile endeavour not only from a
product texture/appearance perspective, but also because of the unique
nutrient composition of animal muscle. This study, despite barely scratching
the surface of muscle biology from a culinary angle, clearly demonstrates that
animal muscle is a carrier/delivery system for a vast arsenal of beneficial
and essential nutrients, vitamins and mineral. Simple supplementation with
essential nutrients often meets insuperable barriers in terms of
bioavailability and what better and more suitable carrier system to use than
what nature provides by engineering our muscle product to include above-
mentioned nutrients and more.

NEXT STEPS:

  * validate B12 and creatine assays and establish baseline levels in our samples 
  * further amend and continue research into relevant compounds
  * create a compound database (containing data from proteomics, lipidomics, total protein, B12, Creatine etc assays)
