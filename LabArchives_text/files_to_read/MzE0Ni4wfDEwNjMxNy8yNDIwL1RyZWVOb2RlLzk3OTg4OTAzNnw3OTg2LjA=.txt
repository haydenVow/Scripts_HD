Sheet formation

After 8 days, Cells in the Vit C only plate had formed a single sheet which
became dethatched with tryple. The sheet could be lifted with tweezers without
breaking. In the VitC +TGF dish, cells had form a single clump of cells, even
before tryple was applied. Untreated samples had not formed cell sheets by day
8.

  




Biomass

The experiment was terminated after 8 days due to detachment of cell sheets
from the culture plastic. Cell mass was recorded as shown below.

24hr

  1. Tube 1 (6836 Vit C + TGF) =  0.076g
  2. Tube 2 (6837 Vit C only) =  0.078g
  3. Tube 3 (negative control #1) = 0.07g
  4. Tube 4 (negative control #2) = 0.07g

Day 8

  1. Tube 1 (6836 Vit C + TGF) =  0.0938g
  2. Tube 2 (6837 Vit C only) = 0.1844g
  3. Tube 3 (negative control #1) = 0.111g
  4. Tube 4 (negative control #2) = 0.1066g
