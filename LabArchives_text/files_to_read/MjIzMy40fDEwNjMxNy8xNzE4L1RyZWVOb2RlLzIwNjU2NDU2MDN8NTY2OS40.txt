Stained and imaged cells adhered to microcarriers

  1. Removed culture(s) from the incubator and placed them in the BSC  `| 17:05 am/pm|`
  2. Swirled culture(s) by hand on the flat surface of the BSC for 5 seconds, the lid was quickly removed and 3x20uL samples of each suspension were taken while the liquid was still in motion. This ensures the carriers were evenly mixed at time of sampling.
  3. Transferred the aliquot(s) to separate wells on a 96 well plate and mixed each with 80uL of dPBS containing 1% w/v poloxomer 88 and 20uL/mL of Hoechst 33342. A new plate ID was created for this sample plate '7050-DOLLY12-Sheep P12-1of1'
    1. Wells in Columns 1-3 were used, a separate row was used for each original culture vessel.
    2. Row A: 6993
    3. Row B: 6992
    4. Row C: 6991
    5. Row D: 6990
    6. Row E: 6989
    7. Row F: 6988.
  4. Returned cultures to the incubator  `| 17:25 am/pm|`
  5. Left the 96 well plate to incubate at room temperature, in the dark (away from light), for 20 minutes.  `| 17:10-17:32 am/pm |`
  6. After incubation the wells were imaged on the Zaber in the main lab.
  7. 1 image at the centre of each well was captured under Phase and UV light magnification, same frame for both channels. 
    1. UV settings: 60ms, 35 lamp intensity
    2. Phase settings: 3ms, 2.4 lamp intensity
  8. One more set of images were captured with the UV settings on 100ms exposure time. To boost the Hoechst signal on microcarriers.  
  9. Once images were captured, the second set of images (the ones taken using 100ms of UV exposure time) were selected for analysis using the 'uCarrier cell count' tool from MIA capture. [9:10
  10. Each image file was labelled with the suffix 7050-HTcarriersDay5. Replicate imaging file was subsequently labelled with the suffix '(2)' Files can be found on the Zaber Z drive or in the Vow P cloud account.  

  




### Observations/Summary:

### All samples had cells attached to microcarriers. Samples from E flasks had
noticeably more cells per microcarrier than 50mL spin tube cultures.
