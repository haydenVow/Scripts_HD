Develop and complete â‰¥1 run of a HTP platform for cell density & viability analysis of >90 suspension cultures.


Scoring Guide:

0.25 = HTP platform is fully designed

0.5 = HTP platform for 96 cultures is tested

0.75 =  1 full run of the HTP platform is completed.

1.0 = HTP platform identifies at least 1 ingredient which significantly
improves a metric of interest.

Metrics of interest: Viability of cells in suspension, total number of cells
in suspension, volumetric biomass production.

  

Considerations:

  1. Increase the number of suspension cultures we are capable of working with to 10s-100s.
  2. Purpose: Suspension and/or media optimisation
  3. Run at least 1 in the quarter
