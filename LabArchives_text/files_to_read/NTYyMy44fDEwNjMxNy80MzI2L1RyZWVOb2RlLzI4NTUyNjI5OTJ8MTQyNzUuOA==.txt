Aim/Purpose


Determine the optimal feeding rate to maximise cell survival in MuSC
differentiation, using both E6 media and 2% HS media. This aims to
troubleshoot cell loss that has been observed in Q3 of 2021.


Hypothesis


The current 100% daily feed with E6 differentiation media is causing cell
loss.


Technical Gap


Cell loss needs investigation and troubleshooting in order to have cells
available for muscle growth and maturation. We do not have definitive evidence
in the optimal feeding schedule/ratio of media dilution to maximise cell
survival.




  1. [Experiment Plan] 
    * Get cells ready and grow them in growth media
      1. D-7 Gelatin-coating of 3 x T175 at 37 C for 1h 
      2. Make up 0.5L DMEM/F12 + 20% FBS + 1xP/S + 10mM P38i and warm it up in the water bath
      3. Collect 1 cryovial of cells (1 vial contains 500 000 cells) and thaw by placing it in a foam floater in water bath  

      4. In the BSC, add 0.5ml of DMEM/F12 + 20% FBS + 1xP/S + 10mM P38i growth media into the vial containing the thawed cells  

      5. Add the vial containing the cells into 90ml of pre-warmed, fresh DMEM/F12 + 20% FBS + 1xP/S + 10mM P38i growth media and mix using a pipette
      6. Pipette 30ml into each of the T175 
      7. D -6 Feed cells with 50% DMEM/F12 + 20% FBS + 1xP/S + 10mM P38i (always add P38i when media will be used). This is remove 15 of the 30 ml in each of the flasks and add 15 ml of fresh media.
    * Passage cells and feeding 
      1. D -4 Gelatin coating of 4 x 96 wp at 37 C for at least 1h
      2. Add trypLE to 3 x T175 and centrifuge
      3. Aspirate the supernatant and resuspend the pellet in pre-warmed, fresh growth media
      4. Cell count and aliquot the required volume to pre-warmed growth media so that each of the wells in the 96 wp has 640 cells/well
      5. D -2 Feed cells
    * Differentiation assay
      1. D0 Feed the cells with either E6 or DMEM/F12 + 2% HS according to the image below and fix plate day 0:   

      2. Wednesday D1: Feed daily wells (3 x 96 wp)
      3. Thursday D2: Feed all wells (3 x 96wp)
      4. Friday D3: Feed daily wells (3 x 96wp)
      5. Saturday D4: Feed all wells (2 x 96wp) and fix plate day 4 
      6. Sunday D5: Feed daily wells (2 x 96wp)
      7. Monday D6: Feed all wells (2 x 96wp)
      8. Tuesday D7: Feed daily wells (1 x 96wp) and fix plate day 7
      9. Wednesday D8: Feed all wells (1 x 96wp)
      10. Thursday D9: Feed daily wells (1 x 96wp)
      11. Friday D10: Fix plate day 10
    * Fixing, staining, image, analyse protocol
      1. Remove differentiation media
      2. Wash 2 x with PBS
      3. Fix with PFA 
      4. Wash 2 x with PBS
      5. Permeabilise with PBS/Triton (Triton is a detergent) 
      6. Wash 2x with PBS
      7. Block 
      8. IF stain (antibody): primary stain with anti-MyoG and anti-MF20
      9. Secondary antibody stain
      10. Zaber imaging
      11. Analysis (ImageJ macros)
    * Write a report with conclusions
