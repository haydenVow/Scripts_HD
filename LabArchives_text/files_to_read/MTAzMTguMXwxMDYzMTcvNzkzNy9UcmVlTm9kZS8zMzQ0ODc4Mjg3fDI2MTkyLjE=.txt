Process  
Initial digestion

  1. Removed muscle biopsy from the fridge and transfer to BSC.  timestamp`   
`

  2. Transferred the biopsy to 1 x 10cm (pre-weighed or tared on scale)
  3. Inside the BSC, trim the muscle piece until it is 4-6g in weight (5g is ideal) 
  4. Add 2mL of WM to the 4-6g biopsy piece

Blot the biopsy to remove any blood, and then quickly cut off any adherent
fat/connective tissue (don't spend ages doing this, just anything large
clearly hanging off). Get the biopsy into a dish sooner rather later to
prevent it from drying out.

    
  
  
  
Add 2mL of MDB solution to the lid. Set timer for 12 mins. Mince muscle  using
2 x disposable scalpels

Transfer small pieces of the tissue to the lid and using forceps to hold the
tissue at one end and two scalpels, mince each muscle piece until it is
slushed sufficiently. Then proceed to transfer the next piece, repeat until
all are homogeneously slushed.

  
    
  
  
  
Transfer the minced muscle to a 50 mL conical tube up to 10mL of MDB (freshly
prepared and filtered).

Seal the tube well with Parafilm and incubate in a 37°C water bath with
agitation (60-70 rpm on the recommended model of shaking water bath) for 1
hour. Tubes should be positioned horizontally along the shaking path and
completely submerged in water. Use weights to keep the tubes submerged.

If the muscle is well digested, triturate through a 10mL serological pipette.

If there are still muscle chunks, using a 10ml syring and 20-gauge needle,
aspirate and eject the muscle suspension in and out of the syringe 10x.

CRITICAL STEP: The needle may be clogged by small pieces of tendon or
undigested muscle during the first few attempts. If clogging occurs during
trituration, remove the clog from the tip of the needle. If clogging occurs
during ejection, pull the plunger up and down to move the clog out of
position. Eject towards the wall of the tube (as opposed to the bottom) to
avoid foaming.

Culture the isolate

Note: The homogenate from each biopsy should be split into 4 equal portions. 3
of the portions should be frozen immediately as raw homogenate, while the 4th
potion is placed into immediate culture.  

  1. Placed xxxx of xxxx media in the water bath at 37C and warmed for at least 20min  timestamp   

  2. Took the falcon tubes containing 1/4 of the crude homogenate from each biopsy from the centrifuge (see section above) and resuspend in 3mL of pre-warmed growth media per tube. 
  3. Transfered to 1x well of a 6-well plate (use a separate plate for each biopsy) 
  4. Parafilmed plates to avoid possible contamination leak into the incubator
  5. Incubated at 37C and 50% CO2, Library Lab incubator timestamp
