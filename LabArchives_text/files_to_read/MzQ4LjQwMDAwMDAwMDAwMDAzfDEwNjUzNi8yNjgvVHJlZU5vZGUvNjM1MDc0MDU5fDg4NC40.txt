Passage 4 - 1x10CF into 2x5CS and 7xRoller Bottles


# Procedure - Passage

### Note: Fibroblasts do NOT require Gelatin coated Flasks, and do NOT require
p38i.

1\. Turn on water bath and set temperature to 37'C.

2\. Place new seeding flasks into the 37'C incubator to pre-warm.

3\. Take the flasks for harvest and observe under the microscope at 4x
objective for even cell distribution . Refer to VSOP-006. Take 2-3 images per
flask.

4\. Aliquot required volume of dPBS (37'C), dPBS (ambient temp), TrypLE, and
Growth Media in separate sterile pots. Refer to Table below for required
volume.

``

5\. Place aliquots in pre-warmed water bath and leave for ~20 minutes or until
warmed. Note: Ensure TrypLE is thoroughly warmed.

6\. Transfer aliquots and flasks required for harvest into the BSC.

7\. Discard growth media from each flask.

8\. Wash with warmed dPBS, then discard.

9\. Add TrypLE to each of the flasks. Mix thoroughly to ensure coverage of the
surface area.

10\. Place in the incubator at 37'C. After 8-10 minutes, remove flasks and
observe for 95-100% dissociation of cells. Incubate further until maximum
dissociation level is reached.  
NOTE: The flasks must be removed from the incubator within 18 minutes of
initial incubation of TrypLE containing flasks.

11\. Pour the TrypLE solution from the flask into 250mL centrifuge tubes.

12\. Add ambient temperature dPBS to each flask as a final wash. To
effectively remove remaining cells adhered to the flasks, mix thoroughly and
then pour the dPBS into 250mL centrifuge tubes.

13\. Centrifuge at 650 x g for 5 minutes.````

14\. Gently remove centrifuge tubes from the machine, ensuring not to disturb
the suspended pellets. Aspirate as much supernatant as possible from the
tubes. Discard supernatant.

15. Following cell harvest and centrifugation, re-suspend the cell pellets in each tube. Use the table below to determine the resuspension volume required.

Tube TypeResuspension Volume Required (mL)  
500uL vial0.5  
50mL 1  
250mL5  
  
16\. Once cells have been resuspended in the individual centrifuge tubes,
combine all of the cell containing solution into one vessel carefully
calculating the total volume each time solution is added.

17\. After removing the cell containing solution from all centrifuge tubes,
rinse the tubes with media to collect all reaming cells. After the rinse is
complete, aspirate this solution and add it to the rest of the cell
suspension. *Note: Be careful to calculate the total volume of the cell
suspension each time solution is added, including during this rinse step.

18\. Perform cell count (Refer to VSOP-007) and enter details into Production
Cell Count Calculator: VBLT-001 and Cell Count Widget.

19\. Triturate the obtained cell suspension 10 times using a 5mL serological
pipette to ensure a homogeneous cell suspension is obtained.

20\. Determine the required volume of suspension media (to achieve seeding
density of roughly 6500-8500 cells/cm2)  and dispense into pre-aliquoted
growth media. Use Production Cell Count Calculator: VBLT-001, and record the
values in the seeding widget.

21\. Transfer flasks from the incubator into the BSC.

22\. Transfer required growth media + cells into each flask.

23\. Transfer the flasks into the 37'C incubator. Refer to Appendix 3 for
incubation conditions.

Procedure - Thawing Myoblasts

                                                                          

  1. Coat flasks with 0.1% gelatin solution per flask and place in the 37C Incubator for 1 hour. Refer to V-SOP-002 for gelatin preparation if required.
  2. Extract required growth media into aliquots as listed in the table above and add p38i to each aliquot. Mix thoroughly and place into a heated 37C water bath for 20 minutes. 
  3. Select the vial/s for thawing. Note the location of the vial in Liquid Nitrogen(LN) Dewer.  
Path: Stockyard v1 > Frozen Cultures > Select Vial/s (Use highest number
first, ie 62of62)

  4. Obtain selected number of cryovial/s from LN Dewar and thaw in the 37C water bath on a foam floater for a maximum of 5 minutes.  
*NOTE: Ensure to wear PPE and work swiftly whilst performing this this task. Ensure to wear cryogloves and face shield when handling the liquid nitrogen dewar. Ask a Vowzer for help if required.
  5. Spray and wipe the cryovial and growth media thoroughly with 70% EtOH and transfer into the Biohazard Safety Cabinet (BSC).
  6. Slowly add 500uL of growth media into the/each vial. This will produce a total of 1mL cell suspension per vial.
  7. Resuspend the cells gently and transfer all contents from the vial to the bottom of a 50mL falcon tube. *NOTE: Dispensing suspension of cells on the sides of the tube will risk loss of cells in Step 11.
  8. Add an additional 500uL of growth media to each vial to collect remaining cells and add into the centrifuge tube. A total of 1.5mL will be in each vial.
  9. Resuspend cells thoroughly and immediately extract 50uL into a microcentrifuge tube.
  10. Perform cell count (Refer to VSOP-007) from collected sample and use the Cell Counting Spreadsheet  to enter data.
  11. Extract all contents from the centrifuge tube and dispense into the prepared growth media. Wash the tube with 5-10 mL of the same growth media to extract remaining cells attached to the tube.
  12. Transfer the gelatin coated flasks from the 37C incubator into the BSC.
  13. Discard the gelatin and add required volume of growth media to each flask, ensuring the entire surface is coated and leave inside the BSC for 20 - 40 minutes. Use the 'Bec Drop' to lay down the flasks.
  14. Transfer and incubate overnight at 37C.

Passage on 1x10CF
Seeding of 2x5CS
Roller Bottles
Thawing Myoblasts


Note, cells we washed from their vials into a single 50 mL tube and topped up
to 30 mL final volume with growth media.

The 50 mL tube was then spun at 700 g for 5 minutes and the pellet was
resuspended in 15 mL fresh growth media (to remove the cryopreservant prior to
counting and culturing).
