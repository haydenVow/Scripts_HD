Aim/Goal


TO create a solid foam that is stable at 30 degrees and submerged.


Plan


1\. Create a 0.02M citric acid solution using chicken stock as a basis (for
flavour and media analogue).

2\. Heat to a simmer and add 2.3% w/v Carboxy Methylcellulose to disperse,
followed by 0.6% w/v Xanthan gum to disperse.

3\. Take off heat and whisk to stiff peaks, or alternatively use an immersion
blender.

4\. Line a dehydrator try with parchment paper, using a piping bag, pipe bite
sized mounds.

5\. A. Dehydrate at 65 degrees celcius for 4 hours or until cripsy.

5\. B. Bake in an oven at 165 degrees celcius until crispy.
