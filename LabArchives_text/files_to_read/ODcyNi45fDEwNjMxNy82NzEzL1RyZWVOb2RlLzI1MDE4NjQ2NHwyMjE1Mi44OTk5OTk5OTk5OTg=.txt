Took samples

  1. Sprayed down the sample line end with 70% ethanol.
  2. Connected a 5 mL sterile syringe.
  3. Withdrew 1 mL (to purge the line), discarded
  4. Connected a fresh sterile syringe and withdrew 1 mL of sample.
  5. Disconnected sample syringe and transferred 1 mL of sample each to 1.5 mL Eppendorf tubes for cell count
  6. Sprayed sample line with 70% ethanol.
  7. Performed cell count:
    1. 5.83B cells total (2,750,000 cells/mL)

### Observations/Summary:

  * pH = 7.28
  * Temp = 37degC
  * dO2 = 0 ???? (watched % nose dive from ~10 to 0 in minutes)
  * swapped out sodium bicarb bottle for second bottle, attached bottle drained of all volume
    * removed line from BASE-T
    * sprayed down both bottles and brought into BSC
    * removed lids (aspectically) and swapped out bottles
    * returned line to BASE-T
  * could not pause BASE-T pump (on cascade mode)
  * BASE-T will give false reading about volume pumped into system, as line was trying to pump dry bottle
  * prepared new sodium bicarb and placed for autoclaving
  * manually increased air via regulator. dO2 increased and then dropped
