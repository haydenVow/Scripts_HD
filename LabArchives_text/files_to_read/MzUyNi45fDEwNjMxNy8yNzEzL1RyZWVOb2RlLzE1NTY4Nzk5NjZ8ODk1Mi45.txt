1\. Prepared  2 mL  PBST (0.2% Triton-X)

2\. Prepared  4 mL  blocking buffer: PBST (0.1% Triton-X + PBS) + 3% bovine
serum albumin (BSA). (Kept in the fridge until needed in blocking step)

3\. Prepared Primary Antibody Mix: :  10µL   Primary #1 MyoG (Santa Cruz)
(1:200  ) +  1990 µL Blocking Buffer

Total volume required of primary antibody mix =  2 mL

Pipette-mixed antibody mix and stored refrigerated away from light until
needed.

Process:

Fixing ( ~ 20 - 30 min)

  1. Removed media from each well and wash with PBS (200 uL). 
  2. Added  100 µL PFA for 15 min:  09:56 - 10:11
  3. Removed PFA (and add in PFA waste container) and wash wells with  200µL PBS. 

  

Permeabilise ( ~ 20 - 30 min)

1\. Removed PBS from each well.

2\. Added  100µL PBST (0.2% Triton-X) to each well for 15 min:  10:17 - 10:32

3\. Aspirated PBST for each well.




Blocking ( ~ 1 hr)

1\. Added  100 µL of blocking buffer (3% BSA in PBST [0.1% Triton-X]) and
incubate for 45 minutes - 1hr at RT. (no more than 1 hour):   10:36 - 11:36  




Single/Simultaneous Primary Antibody staining ( ~ 10 minutes or 2hr)

1\. Removed blocking buffer from each well.

2\. Incubated cells with primary antibody at 4ºC overnight    100 uL in each
well  :    11:39  

  1. Plate labelled as    MyoG staining AK EPIC 20128 

3\. Parafilmed plates and stored at 4ºC in tissue culture lab Fridge.

After this step, all further task should be performed in a dark room. The
vessel should also be wrapped foil when not used.
