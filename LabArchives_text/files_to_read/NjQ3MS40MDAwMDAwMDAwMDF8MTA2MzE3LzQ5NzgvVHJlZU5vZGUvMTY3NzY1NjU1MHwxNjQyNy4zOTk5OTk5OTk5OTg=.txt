Discussion  

Cell isolation protocols  
We have demonstrated the successful isolation, culture and expansion of
plastic adherent crocodile cells using 2 different cell isolation protocols.
The first being a collagenases + dispase digestion protocol performed 30°C,
and the 2nd being a trypsin digestion protocol, also performed at 30°C. Except
for lowering the digesting temperature from 37°C to 30°C , the collagenase +
dispase process performed was identical to Vows existing cell isolation
protocol, which is routinely used at Vow for the isolation of satellite cells
and fibroblasts from mammalian muscle tissue. The trypsin digestion protocol
was adapted from previously published examples reporting reptilian cell
isolations via the incubation of tissue in trypsin-EDTA (Mansell, Jacobson,
Gaskin, & biology, 1989; Xu et al., 2018). If CHOMP07 continues to perform as
well as CHOMP09 with continued expansion to WCB, it may be beneficial to use
the trypsin isolation protocol instead of the collagenase + dispase digestion
for future reptilian cell isolations. The trypsin based procedure is simpler
and less time consuming than the collagenase + dispase, which would allow
scientists to process more biopsies in the same amount of time, increasing the
diversity of our cell banks.

Failure of outgrowth cultures  
Our attempts to establish a culture of adherent cells from dermal tissue
outgrowths was not successful. This is despite the fact that the successful
culture of reptilian cells following similar methods has being extensively
reported (Clark et al., 1970; Ezaz et al., 2008; Fukuda et al., 2018; Kawai et
al., 2007; Moghanjoghi et al., 2018; Work, Dagenais, Weatherby, Balazs, &
Ackermann, 2017). It would be of benefit for Vow to obtain fibroblast cells
from a range of tissues, including muscle and dermal tissue, in order to
increase the diversity of our cell stocks. Outgrowth culture should therefore
be re-attempted in future.  Alternative methods could be investigated, such as
a combinatory approach involving partial digestion of dermal tissue prior to
plating. In theory, this may allow easier migration of cells from the tissue,
facilitating attachment to the culture vessel.

Media optimisation  
This study showed a marked difference in cell proliferation between cells
cultured in DMEM/F12 based media compared to M199 based media. This may
partially account for our failure to establish an adherent cell population
from our first CHOMP biopsies, which were cultured in M199. See lab book here:

While it is clear that DMEM/F12 + 20% FBS + 1 x P/S supports greater rates of
proliferation of adherent CHOMP cells than M199 + 20% FBS + 1 x P/S, it is
likely that further media optimisation would facilitate even greater
performance by these cells. Performing a proliferation assay comparing a
variety of growth medias, would allow us to gain further insight into the
optimal culture conditions for these cells. Growth medias used in the
literature for the culture of reptilian primary cell lines include bases of
DMEM only, DMEM/F12, MEM, Hams12 and EBM along with the addition of 10-20% FBS
and other additives such as fish serums and embryo extracts, bFGF and NEAAs
(see literature review in the background section of this experiment)

Culture temperature  
It is unsurprising that CHOMP cells had a greater rate of proliferation, and
shorter cell doubling times when cultured at 30°C compared to 37°C.  Reptile
cells generally require lower culture temperatures than mammalian cells, with
an approximate correlation between the species natural climate and the optimal
culture temperature (Clark, Cohen, Karzon, & Medicine, 1970; Herbst, Sundberg,
Shultz, Gray, & Klein, 1998).

Delayed attachment to culture plastic  
We found that CHOMP cells took a long time (up to 8 days) to adhere to culture
plastic. This indicates that these cells were able to survive while unattached
to the culture vessel for several days. It is hoped that this natural
tolerance for being in suspension, may make these cells more amenable to
suspension culture. CHOMP cells should therefore be expanded to WCBs as soon
as possible so that they can be used by the science team for suspension
experiments.

Limitations

After performing the 37°C collagenase + dispase digestion protocol, cells were
culture in one condition only, which was DMEM/F12 +20% FBS + 1x P/S media,
incubated at 37°C. As we now know that CHOMP cells grow much better at 30°C
compared to 37°C, it is unclear if this culture failed  to thrive due to the
high incubation temperature, or because the 37°C digestion temperature itself
was detrimental to the cells. We believe however that it is likely to be a
combination of both of these factors.  
  
Only 2 media compositions were trialled in this study. As mentioned above, and
in the literature review located in the background section for this
experiment, reptilian cells have reportedly been cultured in a broad range of
media formulations and the 2 medias selected for this study may not be optimal
for Salt Water Crocodile cells specifically.  
  
We were unable to obtain an adherent cell population from our dermal outgrowth
culture, limiting us to muscle derived cells, and restricting the diversity of
our cell banks.

Conclusions  
For the first time in Vows history, we have successfully isolate, culture and
expand plastic adherent reptilian cells. We were able to do this following 2
distinct protocols, which were developed in house by adapting previously
published methods (see review in background section). We saw that DMEM/F12
based media was more suitable than M199 based medias for these cells, and that
a culture temperature of  30°C is preferred to 37°C.  Further optimisation of
cell culture conditions should be performed (as discussed below). As our
dermal cultures failed, methods for dermal outgrowth  will need to be further
developed if Vow would like to add these cells to their arsenal in future.  
  
Future Directions  
 The CHOMP07 and CHOMP09 MCBs banked will need to be expanded to WCBs for use
by the Production and Science teams. Production have requested banks of >300M
cells for each of these cell lines. During this expansion, the cell lines
should be tracked and compared in terms of cells morphology and doubling
times. This will allow us to make inferences about which of the two cell
isolation protocols resulted produced the healthiest, and most prolific cell
line.  
  
To further understand the differences between our CHOMP07 and CHOMP09 lines, a
proliferation assay should be performed to compare their growth rates/ cell
doubling times. Additionally, pa proliferation assay will provide the
opportunity to compare the affects of different media formulations on cell
proliferation. As discussed, a broad range of medias have been reportedly used
for the culture of adherent reptilian cells (see literature review in the
background section of this experiment). Media optimisation for Salt Water
Crocodile cells specifically may facilitate greater survival and proliferation
of our CHOMP cells.  
  
The development of effective outgrowth culture methods would allow us to
diversify our cell banks to include dermal fibroblasts, in addition to our
muscle derived fibroblast cells. Outgrowth should therefore be re-attempted
when biopsies are next collected. As an example, more finely macerating, or
partially enzymatically digesting tissue prior to plating may aid cell
migration from the tissue, and facilitate cell detachment to the culture
vessel.

Here we found that CHOMP cells took a long time (up to 8 days) to adhere to
culture plastic, and that adherent cell populations could be established from
tissue digested with collagenase + dispase at 37°C. It is therefore possible
that the cells isolated from our initial CHOMP biopsy (see lab book here:

are viable but that they were not cultured for long enough to adhere to the
plastic during the initial thaw (see lab book here: https://au-
mynotebook.labarchives.com/share/Vow%2520-%2520Team%2520Science/MzYyNy4wfDEwNjMxNy8yNzkwLTIwODg1L1RyZWVOb2RlLzM0MjMxMTgwNjJ8OTIwNy4w).
These cells were also initially cultured in M199 based media, which we now
know is not optimal for CHOMP cells. We will therefore trial thawing more
CHOMP01-05 isolate, and culturing at 30°C in DMEM/F12 based media to assess
viability and proliferative capacity.
