### Process

  1. Took 2 x 1000 uL sample from cultures 7694 & 7673 during 100% feeds
  2. Split each 1000 uL sample into 2 x 500 uL sample, for a total of 8 x 500 uL samples and labelled as such:
    1. 7694, dead, NW (no wash)
    2. 7694, live, NW (no wash)
    3. 7694, dead, W (wash)
    4. 7694, live, W (wash)
    5. 7673, dead, NW (no wash)
    6. 7673, live, NW (no wash)
    7. 7673, dead, W (wash)
    8. 7673, live, W (wash)
  3. Removed 50 uL from each live sample for regular stain and count - each live sample now contains 450 uL
  4. Placed 4 x 500 uL samples (2 from each culture) into the drying oven at 50'C for 15 - 30 minutes to kill cells (negative controls) 16:19 - 16:45
  5. Prepared CMFDA working solution (protocol adapted from this lab book entry)
    1. Removed the CMFDA powder from the freezer (main lab) and allowed it to warm to room temperature. Each aliquot is 50 ug.
    2. Briefly centrifuged the tube to pellet the CMFDA powder
    3. Added 50 uL DMSO to the powder and pipette up and down until well suspended. This will yield a 1 mM stock solution.
      * NOTE - Once prepared, the DMSO stock solution should be stored at -20'C in a 70 mL pot submerged in silica-gel desiccant beads for a short period for one series of experiments. 
    4. Transfer 4 uL of the 1 mM CMFDA stock solution to 2 mL of prepared dPBS in a light safe 15 mL falcon tube to protect it from light. Vortex to ensure thorough mixing with the resulting solution being approximately 2 uM CMFDA working solution.
  6. Centrifuged all cell samples (live & dead) labelled "W" (wash) for 5 minutes at 650 x g 16:57 - 17:02   

  7. Removed supernatant from cell pellets and replaced with 500 uL dPBS. Gently resuspended cells using a P1000, then centrifuged again for 5 minutes at 650 x g17:05 - 17:10   

  8. Removed dPBS from pellets and replaced with 500 uL of 2 uM CMFDA working solution
  9. Added 1 uL of 1 mM CMFDA stock solution to all cell samples (live & dead) labelled "NW" (no wash) to make up 2 uM CMFDA solution in medium
  10. Placed all aliqouts in incubator at 37'C, 5% CO2 17:15
  11. After 15 minutes incubation, took 100 uL aliquots from each sample and add to separate wells of 96-well plate. Replace samples in incubator.
  12. Imaged plate on Zaber Plate 8142 wells H1-H4, H6-H9   

    1. H17673, live, W (wash) 
    2. H27673, dead, W (wash)
    3. H37694, live, W (wash)
    4. H47694, dead, W (wash)
    5. H67673, live, NW (no wash)
    6. H77673, dead, NW (no wash)
    7. H87694, live, NW (no wash)
    8. H97694, dead, NW (no wash)
  13. After 30 minutes incubation (from start), took 100 uL aliquots from each sample and add to separate wells of 96-well plate. Replace samples in incubator.
  14. Imaged plate on Zaber Plate 8142 wells F1-F4, F6-F9   

    1. F17673, live, W (wash) 
    2. F27673, dead, W (wash)
    3. F37694, live, W (wash)
    4. F47694, dead, W (wash)
    5. F67673, live, NW (no wash)
    6. F77673, dead, NW (no wash)
    7. F87694, live, NW (no wash)
    8. F97694, dead, NW (no wash)
