1\. Prepared    2mL  PBST (0.2% Triton-X)

2\. Prepared    2mL  blocking buffer: PBST (0.1% Triton-X + PBS) + 3% bovine
serum albumin (BSA). (Kept in the fridge until needed in blocking step)

3\. Prepared Primary Antibody Mix:  7.5 µL   Primary #1 MyoG (Santa Cruz)
(1:200  ) +  30 µL   Primary #2 MF20 (DSHB)   (1:50  ) +  1.5  mL Blocking
Buffer

Vortexed antibody mix for 5 seconds and stored refrigerated away from light
until needed.




Antibodies used:

#1562 Primary #1 MyoG IGg1 (Santa Cruz)   (1:200)  

#1473  Primary #2 MF20 IGg2b (DSHB)   (1:50)  




Process:

Permeabilise

1\. Removed PBS from each well.

2\. Added  100 µL PBST (0.2% Triton-X) to each well for 15 min:  11:07 - 11:22
am

3\. Aspirated PBST for each well.




Blocking

1\. Added  100 µL of blocking buffer (3% BSA in PBST [0.1% Triton-X]) and
incubate for 45 minutes - 1hr at RT. (no more than 1 hour):   11:25 - 12:20
a/pm




Single/Simultaneous Primary Antibody staining

1\. Removed blocking buffer from each well.

2\. Incubated cells with primary antibody for 90min - 2hrs at RT, or 4ºC
overnight:   12:30 - 14:35 a/pm

3\. Parafilmed plates and stored at 4ºC in tissue culture lab Fridge.

After this step, all further task should be performed in a dark room. The
vessel should also be wrapped foil when not used.
