Procedure


PREPARE DESTINATION VESSELS

  1. Removed adherent and suspension media mixes from the fridge (See FACS preparation lab book entry for this EPIC) 
  2. 6 x 96 well ultra low attachment plates were filled with 200uL of Hycell Cho growth media. 
  3. 2x 96 well adherent plates were filled with 200uL of DMEM/F12 + 20% FBS + 1xP/S growth media. 
  4. 5mL of Hycell Cho growth media was added to 4 x 50mL bioreactor tubes. 
  5. 12mL of DMEM/F12 + 20% FBS + 1xP/S growth media was added to 3 x T75 flasks. 
  6. 96 well plates were parafilmed before closing the lid (sterile-side down, facing wells, as demonstrated in image below) & then lids and plates were parafilmed together (same fashion as is done for fix and stained plates in fridge) for transport to FACS sorting facility. 
  7. Media for bioreactor tubes and flasks were placed in the water bath at 30 degrees to warm.







PASSAGING OF NUCLEOFECTED CELLS

1\. Took 2 x images of each vessel with microscope on phase setting (4X to
assess confluence)

2\. Aliquoted the required volume of each reagent below, placed all aliquots
to warm in the bead bath for a minimum of 20 minutes prior to use:

  1. TrypLE:   72   mL across   1 x 120 ml  container.
  2.  dPBS (for neutralising & washing):   140   mL across 2x 120mL containers (70mL each) 
  3. dPBS was used for counting cells and was aliquoted at the time of counting.

3\. Time that all aliquots were placed in the water bath the warm before use
10:50 am  

Note: if aliquots were placed in water bath at different time, record the time
stamp for each individual solution.

The cells from each corresponding knockout well were passaged and pooled
respectively before being split for adherent, suspension or FACS destinations.
All washes and supernatant were collected to save any potentially suspension
adapted cells.  

  * Group 1 - PTEN [ST]  

  * Group 2 - PABPC1 [ST]  

  * Group 3 - RIPK1 [NH]  

  * Group 4 - ZIC1 [NH]  

  * Group 5 - Control [ST]   

* * *

4\. Washed each well GENTLY with 2mL of dPBS (warmed).

5\. Added   2  mL tryple to each well and incubated at 37˚C.

6\. Empty wells were neutralised with  2 ml  of dPBS.

7. Cell suspensions were collected in 50mL tubes after trypalisation alongside their washes.

7\. Centrifuged all tubes at 300 x g for 5 min.  

8\. Aspirated the supernatant(s).

9\. Resuspended pellet(s) in  Group 3-4 6mL of dPBS, Groups 1, 2 and 5 were
resuspended in X  medium.  

10\. Aliquoted 10uL of cell suspension for counting using a hemocytometer, and
performed the necessary dilution with Trypan blue (see Cell Count
Spreadsheet).

11\. Cell suspension was counted and the total cell number was determined for
each group.

  2. Group 2: 7,000,000
  3. Group 3 5,160,000
  4. Group 4 5,160,000
  5. Group 5 6,550,000




FACS SORTING SUSPENSION CELLS

  1. Aliquoted 1/5 of the volume of counted cell suspension from groups 3 and 5 into 1.5uL tubes. 
    1. (see cell totals above to determine 1/5)
  2. cells were centrifuged at 400g for 5 minutes
  3. supernatant was removed
  4. Cells were resuspended in FACS buffer (0.5mL)
  5. Cells were then transported on ice to the UNSW sorting facility along with the 8 96 well plates.
  6. inside a BSC at UNSW cells were passed through a 0.22 filter lid collection tube.
  7. 5uL of 7-AAD stain from invitrogen was added to the cell suspensions and cells were incubated for 5 minutes at room temperature
  8. Once at the FACS facility Groups were sorted into 3 x 96 well plates (low attachment each along with 1x96 well plate (adherent), 1 cell per well
  9. Plates were transported back to Vow and moved directly to the incubator at 30 degrees, 5% CO2 (Incubator number #68, 17:15) 




SETTING UP SUSPENSION POOLED CULTURES

  1. For all groups, 3/5 of the counted cell suspensions were transferred to an individual 50mL bioreactor tube containing 5mL of Hycell Cho medium. 
  2. Tubes were left to incubate at 30 degrees, 5% CO2 (incubator # ) shaking at 206 rpm 

  




SETTING UP ADHERENT POOLED CULTURES

  1. For groups 3-5, 1/5 of the counted cell suspension of passaged cells was transferred to individual T75 flasks containing 12mL of DMEM/F12 + 20% FBS + 1xPS media prepared earlier.    

  2. Flasks were left to incubate at 30 degrees, 5% CO2 (incubator #120 ) static. 




DNA EXTRACTION

Screening PCR protocol - DNA extraction of adherent CHOMP

1.    Transferred a sample of cells from each group into separate 1.5 ml tubes (1/10 of counted cell suspension roughly) 

  1. Group 1: [Cell total] 
  2. Group 2: [Cell total]
  3. Group 3:[Cell total] 

2.    Centrifuged cells down to form a pellet (300g for 5 minutes)

3.    Aspirated off media

4.    Resuspended pellet in 100 ul PBS

5.    Centrifuged cells down to form a pellet (300g for 5 minutes) 

6.    Aspirated off PBS

7.    Resuspended in 50 μL HotShot solution and transfer to 0.5 mL tube

8.    Incubated at 95°C for 30 min in the thermocycler using the bentolab

9.    Cooled plates to room temperature, and added 50 μL neutralising buffer, mixing well by pipetting up-and-down with a P200 multichannel pipette.

10.    Stored DNA extractions at 4°C for up to two weeks, or at −20°C for up to 1 year. (fridge/Freezer ID #)
