Aim/Purpose


Use Ammonium sulphate salt to precipitate ECM proteins from waste media


Hypothesis


Supersaturating the media with ammonium sulphate causes soluble proteins (e.g.
un-crosslinked collagens) to precipitate out of solution, where they can be
recovered by centrifugation


Technical Gap
Method/Procedure


  

  1. Add Ammonium sulfate powder to media: 227g / litre media (density is ~ 1g/ml so for larger volumes measuring the AmS as a volume, e.g. 227ml is often easier)
  2. Place in fridge for >4 hours to precipitate proteins. Overnight (or longer) is fine.
  3. Add media to 50ml tubes and centrifuge for 10m at 4,000G at 8C
  4. Observe the tube - check for either floating layer (lipids) and/or pellet (proteins)
  5. Decant lipid layer into a fresh tube. Continue to respin to collect a thicker consolidated supernatant and reserve pellet
  6. Add more media to the same tube to continue adding to the pellet
  7. Repeat steps 3-5 until media is used up
  8. Final ECM pellet can be resuspended in water to re-solubilise and quantify proteins (A) or kept as a precipitate for further processing
