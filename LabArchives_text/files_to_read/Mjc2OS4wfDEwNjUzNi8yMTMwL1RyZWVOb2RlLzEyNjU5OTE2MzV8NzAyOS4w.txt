Procedure

Before starting Media Top Up perform a microscope check to ensure there is no
contamination in the Bioreactor OR media containing vessel.

  1. Connect the media containing vessel to the STR200 or STR2000 in a sterile manner
  2. Use a peristaltic pump to pump media into the Bioreactor at a moderate speed
  3. Once the desired volume is reached immediately clamp the lines to prevent back flow
  4. Dis-connect the Media containing vessel from the bioreactor
