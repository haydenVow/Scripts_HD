Prepare materials for thaw and seed:

  * NOTE: IF PERFORMING A THAW FROM A CLONAL MCB_2 OR WCB_2, PREPARE AT LEAST ONE EXTRA 96 WELL PLATE FOR A DIFFERENTIATION ASSAY. THIS IS AN IMPORTANT QUALITY CONTROL STEP WHILE WE BUILD OUR CLONAL CELL BANK.
  * Suggested layout for diff assay (please refer to previous diff assays for exact seeding, feeding and analysis procedures)  

1\. Aliquotted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then
placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath for a minimum of 20 minutes
prior to use:

  *  Growth media (for seeding):   55 mL 
  * Growth media (for resuspending):  10 ml  

  * Time that aliquot was placed in the water bath to warm before use:   13:45 pm 

  




## Thaw and seed vial:

3\. Collected the cryovial from Liquid Nitrogen storage & placed in the 37
degree bead bath for 5 min

Location where cryovial was collected from:

Vial details: 1  x CHOMP09 cryovials at  10M  cells each for a total of    10M
cells

Brew

Tower/Bucket # 4

Box/Cane # 7  

Vial location: C7  

Vial ID(s): Frozen Culture 13576  

`4. Ethanol sprayed & transferred the vial(s) to the BSC.`

`5.  Added   0.5mL of Growth Media (to generate a total volume of 1mL in the
cryovial) to the cryovial, resuspended the cell suspension gently to reduce
osmotic shock. `

`6. Collected the entire cell suspension & transferred into the pre-warmed
tube containing 5mL of growth media`

`7. Using a 10mL serological pipette, resuspended & distributed the cells
evenly in the  55 mL of pre-warmed Growth Media (prepared in Step 2). `

`8. Transfered  30 mL to each   T175 flask/well`

`9. Transfered flask/plate(s) to incubate at: `

  * [ ]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * [x] 30 ºC, 5% CO2 (reptilian cells), incubator 68
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (aviary cells)

  

Making labels

Note - You will need to increase the passage number by one. (i.e. if your
thawed vial ID has a passage number of 3, when you make a culture ID for you
vessel you will need change the passage number to 4 on Airtable.)

  




Summary:

Thawed 1 x 10M cryovial but only counted 5M cells




We only counted roughly 5 million cells from this vial despite the 10 million
estimated in the vial as recorded in the cell bank entry! There weren't enough
cells for the second round of nucleofection so we needed to thaw another vial
on Friday after the first round to perform this second round.
