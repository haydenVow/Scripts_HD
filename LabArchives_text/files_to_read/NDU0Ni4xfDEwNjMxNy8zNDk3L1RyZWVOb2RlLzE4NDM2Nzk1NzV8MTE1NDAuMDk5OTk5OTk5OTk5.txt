## Phase Imaging

1\. Zaber imaged plate 7514 on phase, taking whole well images of every well
using the zaber   11:19  

For information on how to use the zaber, refer to:

Tips for imaging the 12WP are to use 8x8 imaging sites in the HSC site
generator, remembering to change the spacing rule to field of view with 60 um
spacing. Remember to build the MM List in the HSC site generator and confirm
the number of images expected (usually >700) in the Mult-D Acq.

## Cleaning the Electrodes

When finished with the electrode lid, it will need to be cleaned and stored
away for later use. Before moving onto fixing, switch the electrode lid for a
new regular lid.

1\. Inspect the wiring connections to the electrode to ensure no corrosion or
damage is present and all wiring is still connected as expected.  
2\. Inspect the electrodes closely to ensure no damage or dissolution has
occurred to the metal.  
3\. Spray down the used electrode lid with ethanol.  
4\. Fill the wells of a clean 12WP base with ethanol and place the electrode
plate in this base so the electrodes are immersed in ethanol.

A spare 'wash plate' is kept in the 'Electrodes' box.

5\. Place the 12WP assembly inside the ultrasonic bath so that the water of
the bath is at the line where the 12WP lid meets the base.  
6\. Set the ultrasonic bath temperature to room temperature and the time of
sonication for 15 minutes.  
7\. Reinspect the electrodes. If any media or other organic residue is still
present on the electrodes, repeat step 6.  
8\. Store the electrode lid by placing it onto a clean 12WP base. Ensure the
lid is dry before storage. Optional: Place the lid in the drying oven upside
down at 50C for 15 minutes to increase drying time.  Alternatively, to reuse
the lid immediately, proceed to the UV sterilisation process.




Process:

Fixing ( ~ 20 - 30 min)  
  
FOR PLATE 7514 ONLY

  1. Aliquoted  2 x 50 mL of PBS into  2 x 50 mL falcon tubes and  13 mL  4% PFA into   1x 15 mL  falcon tube. 
  2. Placed in the water bath and warmed for a minimum of 10 mins.   11:30am - 11:45    

  3. Removed media from each well and wash with warmed PBS twice. Only remove the PBS falcon tube from the bath as needed.
  4.  Added   1mL warmed PFA for 15 min:  11:51 - 12:06
  5. Removed PFA (and add in PFA waste container) and wash wells twice with   2 mL warmed PBS. 

  

Permeabilise ( ~ 20 - 30 min)  
  
FOR BOTH PLATES 7513 & 7514

1\. Removed PBS from each well.

2\. Added   1 mL PBST (0.2% Triton-X) to each well for 15 min: 12:41 - 12:55
14:10 - 14:25  

3\. Aspirated PBST for each well.




Blocking ( ~ 1 hr)

1\. Added  1 mL/well of blocking buffer (3% BSA in PBST [0.1% Triton-X]) and
incubate for 45 minutes - 1hr at RT. (no more than 1 hour):  1:00 - 2:00
14:27 - 15:15  




Single/Simultaneous Primary Antibody staining ( ~ 10 minutes or 2hr)

1\. Removed blocking buffer from each well. 14:01    15:16  

2\. Incubated cells with primary antibody for 90min - 2hrs at RT, or 4ºC
overnight:  14:02 - Overnight     15:17 - Overnight  

3\. Parafilmed plates and stored at 4ºC in tissue culture lab Fridge.

After this step, all further task should be performed in a dark room. The
vessel should also be wrapped in foil when not used.


Secondary Staining


Reagent preparation:

1\. Aliquotted    100 mL  PBS for washing

2\. Centrifuged the secondary antibody stock using the benchtop
microcentrifuge for 10 seconds.

3\. Prepared Secondary Antibody mix (pipette from the top/supernatant of
antibody solution):

  13 µL   Secondary #1   (1:1000  ) +   13 µL   Secondary #2   (1:1000  ) +
13  mL Blocking Buffer (PBST (0.1% Triton X + dPBS) + 3% BSA)  

If using AlexaFluor secondary antibodies then the max concentration should be
1:500 (typically used at 1:1000)

Pipette-mixed antibody mix and stored refrigerated away from light until
needed.

4\. Prepared DAPI mix:

   13 mL  PBS +    13 uL  of DAPI

Vortexed DAPI mix and stored refrigerated away from light until needed.




Process:

1\. Removed plate from fridge (incubated in primary antibodies overnight).

2\. Washed 3 times for 5 min with PBS at RT.

 11:35 - 11:40  13:35 - 13:40

 11:45 - 11:50 15:43 - 15:48

 11:50 - 11:55  15:51 - 15:56  

3\. Incubated the cells with secondary antibody mixture in the dark at RT for
1 hour.  16:03 - 17:03 11:55 \- 12:55

NOTE: from this step onwards protect from the light by wrapping plates in foil
and perform experiment in the dark.




Counter staining

1\.  Removed 2nd antibody solution.  17:07  12:56

2\.  Washed with DAPI (1:1000) in PBS for 5 min at RT in the dark.

 12:58 - 1:03  

 17:09 - 17:14  

3\.  Washed in PBS 3 x 5 min at RT in the dark. (No Triton)

 1:04 - 1:09  

 1:14 - 1:19  

4\.  Replaced dPBS.

 1:20 - 1:25  

5\. Confirmed staining on microscope by imaging.
