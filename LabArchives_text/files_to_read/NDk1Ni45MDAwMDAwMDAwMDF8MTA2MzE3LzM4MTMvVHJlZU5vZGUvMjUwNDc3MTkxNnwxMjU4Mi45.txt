### Process:

1\. Took image of vessel with microscope on phase setting.

3\. Aliquotted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then
placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath for a minimum of 20 minutes
prior to use:

  1. TrypLE:     3x3.2    mL in   3  tubes  `11: 45`  

  2.  dPBS (for washing and neutralising):   3x 6.5  mL   in 3 tubes  11:45
  3. Growth media (for pellet resuspension):   3 x 0.5mL
  4. Growth media (for seeding):   3 x 5mL 

Time that all aliquots were placed in the water bath the warm before use
13:07 pm

Note: if aliquots were placed in water bath at different time, record the time
stamp for each individual solution.




4\. Removed vessel(s) from the incubator   13:15 - 13:33 pm

5\. Washed the vessel(s) with dPBS (warmed).

6\. Added   3   mL tryple to each vessel/well and incubated at 37˚C.

  1. Start/Finish for TrypLE was    13:19 pm 

7\. Neutralised with    3mL   dPBS and combined cell suspension into a     1 x
15mL tube each.

8\. Centrifuged at 650 x g for 5 min.

  1. Start/Finish time for centrifugation was   13:40 pm 




9\. Aspirated the supernatant(s).

10\. Resuspended pellet(s) in   0.5   mL    Growth    media   : pm

11\. Aliquoted    10uL    of resuspended cells into a microcentrifuge tube for
each cell count.

12\. Performed a cell count using the haemocytometer and recorded the cell
count data in the Google Doc spreadsheet: Cell Count Spreadsheet or cell count
widget below




1A16: Transferred     397uL  µl of cell suspension to the pre-warmed     5
mL Growth media

3P23: Transferred     446uL  µl of cell suspension to the pre-warmed     5
mL Growth media:

4C4: Transferred     151uL  µl of cell suspension to the pre-warmed     5   mL
Growth media:

14\. Transferred cell suspension into the    1 x T25 flask per clone.

16\. Transferred vessel(s) to incubate at:  14:22 pm  

  * [ X ]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (avian cells)
