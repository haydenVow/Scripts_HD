Inspected the 6 well plates under the microscope and saw that many of the
cultures contained aggregates. Cultures 11491-1, 11491-2, 11488-1 and 11485-2
contained a layer of cells on the surface of the culture that resembled lipid
containing cells. Cell morphology was granular. It was decided that all
cultures other than 11491-1 and 11491-2 cultures would be strained using a
40um filter unit.

Briefly,

  1. cells were collected into 50mL tubes through a 40um filter unit, 
  2. empty wells and cell strainers were then washed with 7mL of dpbs, with the wash collected into the respective 50mL tubes. 
  3. Tubes were then spun for 5 minutes at 500g to pellet cells. Supernatant was discarded and replaced with 3mL of fresh growth media (DMEM/F12 + 20% FBS + 1xP/S). 
  4. Cells were then transferred back to single wells on a ultra low attachment 6 well plate, 1 well per condition.
  5. Cells were returned to incubate shaking at 80 rpm in incubator 68 (30 degrees, 5% CO2.
