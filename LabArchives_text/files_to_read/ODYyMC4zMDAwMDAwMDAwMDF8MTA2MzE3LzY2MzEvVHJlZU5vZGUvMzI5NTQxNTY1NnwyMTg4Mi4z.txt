### Process:

1\. Took image of vessel with microscope on phase setting.

2\. Aliquotted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then
placed all aliquots in water bath

  1. TrypLE:   20  mL
  2.  dPBS (for neutralising & washing):   40  mL
  3. Growth medium (for pellet resuspension):
    1.  ~~CDM4Avian suspension medium  1  mL~~
    2. HyCell CHO suspension medium  1  mL




3\. Washed the vessel(s) with dPBS (warmed).

4\. Added Tryple to each vessel/well and incubated at 37ËšC.

  1. Start/Finish for TrypLE was     13:28 - 13:38   

5\. Neutralised each cell suspension with dPBS. Split each cell suspension in
2.

6\. Centrifuged at 650 x g for 5 min. 13:41  




7\. Re-suspended 1 x pellet in 500 uL FACS buffer. Re-suspended the other
pellet in growth medium and put in fridge for OT2 sorting.

8\. Placed FACS tube cell suspension on ice
