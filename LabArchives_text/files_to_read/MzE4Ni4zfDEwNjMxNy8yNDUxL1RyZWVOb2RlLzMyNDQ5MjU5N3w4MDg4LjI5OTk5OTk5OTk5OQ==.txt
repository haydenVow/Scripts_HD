## Performed by:




Perform feed using below volumes:

96-well plate = at least 200ul per well

48-well plate with inserts = 1mL

24-well plate with inserts = 2ml  
  
NOTE - A high media volume is typically required per sample due to the high
cell seed densities used, and thus the high turn-over of media nutrients - it
is recommended that samples are cultured in wells larger than their size to
accommodate for excess media

Process:  

  1. Aliquotted   mL  of  __ Media and directly add into the     .  (insert cup and tray if applicable) Placed in incubator   : a/pm 
  2. Using a sterile tweezers (autoclaved metal pointy tweezers), carefully transfer each scaffold over to the new plate (eg 24 - well, 48 well with plate inserts) containing growth media. 
    1. Use a 50 mL falcon tube in the BSC to hold the tweezers and maintain sterility between use (easier than putting back into autoclave bag) 
    2. have the new plate side-by-side touching the previous plate during transfer, so if the scaffold drops during transfer it is likely to drop within the new sterile plate.
    3. when transferring scaffolds try to pinch a small area on outside edge of scaffold, do not fold the whole scaffold between tweezers as the scaffold is prone to break. 
    4. when transferring scaffolds in the BSC do so towards the centre of the BSC, when working too close to the filter the movement of air can blow thin/light scaffolds and result in scaffolds being blown away/dropped. Working too close to the filter is also not best practise from a sterility perspective.  

  3. Returned vessel to incubate at: 

  * [ ]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (aviary cells)
