Process:

Aliquoted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then
placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath > 30 minutes prior to use

  1. Observed cultures under the microscope and recorded confluence in the table above. 
  2. Imaged cultures on 10x magnification (captured in Mia)
  3. TrypLE:     10 mL 
  4. dPBS (for washing & neutralising)   20 mL
  5. Growth media (for pellet resuspension and seeding):     40 
  6. Washed the flask(s) with dPBS.
  7. Added    10 tryple to each vessel/well and incubated at 37˚C for    10 
  8. Neutralised with    10 dPBS (warmed) and combined cell suspension into a   50 mL   tubes.
  9. Centrifuged at 650 x g for 5 min.
  10. Aspirated+ discarded supernatant
  11. Resuspended pellet(s) in     10  mL media.  
Performed a cell count using the hemocytometer and recorded the cell count
data in widget or the Google Doc spreadsheet called 'Cell Count Spreadsheet'
(see link below):

  12. Total cell number was:  
 8,080,000

  13. Re-seeded cells as per table above.

  14. Transferred flasks to incubate at 37ºC, 5% CO2, library lab incubator #77
