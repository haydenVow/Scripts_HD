Process:

1\. Aliquotted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then
placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath for a minimum of 20 minutes
prior to use:

  1. TrypLE:   200    mL in  1     tub
  2. dPBS (for neutralising + Washing)   400    mL 
  3. Growth media (for pellet resuspension + Seeding):       mL in        tube
  4. Times that all aliquots were placed in the water bath to warm before use   10:19 (tryple), 10:24 (dPBS), 10:41 (GM) am 

Note: if aliquots were placed in water bath at different times, record the
time stamp for each individual solution.




2\. Washed the flask(s) with dPBS.

3\. Added   200 mL tryple @ 10:50 am  to each vessel/well and incubated at
37˚C for    15    min.

Note: Fibroblasts typically require 15-18 minutes of incubation with tryple,
slightly longer than MuSCs.

  1. Start/Finish time for centrifugation was    11:21    \-    11:26   am

4\. Neutralised with    200 mL   dPBS (warmed) and combined cell suspension
into a       tube.

  




6\. Aspirated the supernatant(s)

7\. Resuspended pellet(s) in      8.8  mL    Growth   media.

8\. Performed a cell count using the haemocytometer and recorded the cell
count data in widget or the Google Doc spreadsheet called 'Cell Count
Spreadsheet' (see link below):

SSIBtIylyrBQE5kRX5Z8NtI/edit#gid=0

  




9\. Total cell number was:   60,720,000  

10\. Seeded ~7k cells per cm2 of the flasks/plates. Note that fibroblasts
prefer to be subcultured closely together.

11\. Volume of cell suspension required for subculture was:   2.9mL x 3  

12\. Transfer   2.9mL x 3 of cell suspension to the pre-warmed   1.2L Growth
Media.

13\. Transfer cell suspension into (non-gelatin coated)   3 x 4CF
flasks/plates.

14\. Transfer flask/plate(s) to incubate at 12:53:

  * [X]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (aviary cells)
