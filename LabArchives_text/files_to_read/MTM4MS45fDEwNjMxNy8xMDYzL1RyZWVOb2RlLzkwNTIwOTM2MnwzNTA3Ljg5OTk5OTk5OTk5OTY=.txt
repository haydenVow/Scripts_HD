5mM Creatine has been shown to promote the fusion of myoblasts assessed by an
increased number of nuclei incorporated within myotubes by 40%. Expression of
myosin heavy chain type II also increased by 1300%, troponin T by 65% and
titin by 40%.

Creatine also promoted the fusion of myoblasts assessed by an increased number
of nuclei incorporated within myotubes (+40%, P < 0.001). Expression of myosin
heavy chain type II (+1,300%, P < 0.001), troponin T (+65%, P < 0.01), and
titin (+40%, P < 0.05) was enhanced by creatine.

Cr supplementation has the unique feature to protect myoblasts from cell death
and to allow surviving cells to circumvent the differentiation arrest caused
by oxidative challenge: in other words, Cr loading might increase the repair/
regeneration balance of muscles subjected to stressing conditions
