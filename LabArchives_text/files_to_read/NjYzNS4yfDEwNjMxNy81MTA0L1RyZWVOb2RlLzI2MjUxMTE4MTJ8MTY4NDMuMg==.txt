Process:

  1. Aliquotted  4 mL  mL of  E6 Media (store at 4C)
  2. Aliquotted  4 mL  mL of  2% HS Media (store at 4C)
  3. Aliquotted  4 mL  mL of  E6 Media (warm at 37C)
  4. Aliquotted  4 mL  mL of  2% HS Media (warm at 37C)
  5. Aliquotted  1 x 10 mL  mL of  E6 Media (warm at 37C)
  6. Placed in water bath   11:11 am 
  7. Removed  100 % of supernatant from vessel (as per below plate maps).  

  8. Replaced with  0.2 mL (per well/per vessel) of  E6 or 2% HS Diff media. 
  9. Returned vessel to incubate at:   13:03 pm (Drying and pipetting experiment) 12:54 (DOLLY12 temperature experiment)

  * [ X]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (aviary cells)

  

  * Incubator (#118  ), Lab [Main]

For feeding the C2C12 plates, start with the first quadrant (allow wells to
dry for 10 seconds and harsh pipetting), followed by the second (allow wells
to dry for 10 seconds and gentle pipetting), the third (feed immediately and
harsh pipetting) and finally the fourth.




### Observations/Summary:

100 % media changed on vessel(s)

Wells G7-G10 have slightly less media (~180 uL) compared to the other wells
due to tight aliquotting of media.
