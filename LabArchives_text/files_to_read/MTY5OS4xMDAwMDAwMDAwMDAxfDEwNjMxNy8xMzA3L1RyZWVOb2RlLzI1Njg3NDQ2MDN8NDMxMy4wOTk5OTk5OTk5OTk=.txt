Reagent preparation:

1\. Aliquotted    36 mL  PBS for washing

2\. Centrifuged the secondary antibody stock using the benchtop
microcentrifuge for 10 seconds.

3\. Prepared Secondary Antibody mix:

  1.   2.7 µL   Secondary #1 AF488  (1:1000) +  2697.3 uL Blocking Buffer (PBST (0.1% Triton X + dPBS) + 3% BSA) To stain all TE-7 conditions

Total volume needed = 2700 uL

  1.   0.9 µL   Secondary #2 AF488  (1:1000) +  899.1  uL Blocking Buffer (PBST (0.1% Triton X + dPBS) + 3% BSA) To stain Vimentin condition with independent secondary antibody (AF488)

Total volume needed = 900 uL

If using AlexaFluor secondary antibodies then the max concentration should be
1:500 (typically used at 1:1000)

Vortexed antibody mix for 5 seconds and stored refrigerated away from light
until needed.

4\. Prepared DAPI mix:

  4495.5 uL  PBS +   4.5 uL  of DAPI

Total volume needed = 4500 ul

Vortexed DAPI mix and stored refrigerated away from light until needed.




Process:

1\. Removed plate from fridge (incubated in primary antibodies overnight).

2\. Washed 3 times for 5 min with PBS at RT.

 11:34 - 11:39

 11:42 - 11:47

 11:49 - 11:54

3\. Incubated the cells with secondary antibody mixture in the dark at RT for
1 hour. 12:07 - 13:07

NOTE: from this step onwards protect from the light by wrapping plates in foil
and perform experiment in the dark.




Counter staining

1\.  Removed 2nd antibody solution. 13:08

2\.  Washed with DAPI (1:1000) in PBS for 5 min at RT in the dark.

13:10 - 13:15

3\.  Washed in PBS 3 x 5 min at RT in the dark. (No Triton)

13:16 - 13:21

13:23 - 13:28

4\.  Replaced dPBS.

13:30

5\. Confirmed staining on microscope by imaging.
