Note

Due to time contraints, cell counts were not performed for this passage.
Instead, they each culture being passaged was given a 1:3 split, so were
passaged from a T175 to 3x T175s.

### Process for Passage:

  1. Took image of vessel with microscope on phase setting.
  2. Aliquoted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath for a minimum of 20 minutes prior to use
  3. Removed vessel(s) from the incubator
  4. Washed the vessel(s) with dPBS (warmed).
  5. Added    10    mL tryple to each vessel/well and incubated at 37˚C for 12min (checked after 10min, then incubated for a further 2min until >90% of cells were detached).
  6. Neutralised with    10      dPBS and combined cell suspension into      50ml   tubes.
  7. Centrifuged at 650 x g for 5 min.
  8. Aspirated the supernatant(s).
  9. Resuspended each pellet(s) in      6 mL/tube    PBS 
  10. Took 2x 30ul aliquots and performed trypan blue counts

10540 BIRDY in OptiPRO media: 2,934,000 (note this was much lower than
anticipated)  

  11. Re-seeded 2 x T175 for each culture, 30mL per vessel, 8382/cm  

  12. Transferred vessel(s) to incubate:   
37ºC, 5% CO2  
Incubator #77, Library Lab  
  




Observations/Summary:  
Cell count was much lower than anticipated, and resulted into seeding into
fewer vessels than they were taken from.
