  1. Added 2.5 g of dry Cytodex 1 microcarriers to the bioreactor vessel.
  2. Hydrate the microcarriers in enough PBS to just cover the impeller (~700 mL) Ca2+and Mg2+free PBS (50 to 100 mL/g of Cytodex) for at least 3 h at room temperature (or shorter at 37 deg C).
  3. Drain the supernatant (~450 mL) until the liquid level falls just below the impeller (~200 mL)
  4. Add fresh Ca2+ and Mg2+ free PBS (30 to 50 mL/g of Cytodex) (~500 mL) to just cover the impeller for 2 to 3 minutes.
  5. Drain the PBS until the impeller no longer touches the liquid
  6. Add fresh Ca2+ and Mg2+ free PBS (30 to 50 mL/g of Cytodex) (~ 500 mL) to just cover the impeller.

  1. Checked any "wetted" materials (materials that come into contact with the culture or additives and are therefore required to maintain sterility) for damage or residues that may introduce contamination (examples include seals and tubing).
  2. Checked any potentially dangerous equipment (e.g. gas regulators, gas lines, pressure release valves) for abnormalities that may lead to an accident.
