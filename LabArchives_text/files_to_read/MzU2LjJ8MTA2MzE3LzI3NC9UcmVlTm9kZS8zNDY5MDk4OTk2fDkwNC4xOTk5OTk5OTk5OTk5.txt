Aim/Purpose


Aim/Purpose : To expand cells from working cell bank vials for use in R&D




Additional Notes

The expansion team will grow and maintain cell cultures (thaw, feed, passage)
up until a desired cell number is achieved. From there, the cells are shared
with project teams within science to seed out experiments. The reason behind
this is to:

  1. Reduce lead time for the project team to start new experiments 
  2. Ensure that cells provided across Science are: 
    1. Within a specific range of passage numbers
    2. Have been treated the same ie same conditions, media, growing period.
    3. Minimise loss of viable cells during the thaw period (ie requiring < 0.5M cells) 
    4. increase efficiency in growing cells across the whole of science  

Method for growing cells will follow the gold standard method at Vow -
currently 4CF methods.

  


Hypothesis


That sharing the cell thawing and expansion process will result in lower
average cell culture effort and time due to economies of scale.


Method/Procedure


Experiment Plan

Below are events that will occur in one cycle of cell expansion:

  * Day 1 (Mon): Preperation on Reagents (Growth Media, PBS, Gelatine, Tryple) 
  * Day 2 (Tue):Thaw cells 
  * Day 3 (Wed): 100% Feed 
  * Day 5 (Fri): Passage
  * Day 7 (Sun): 50% Feed 
  * Day 8 (Mon): Passage & Seed experiments 
  * Day 10 (Wed): 50% Feed 
  * Day 11 ( Thurs): Passage & Seed experiments
  * BELOW EVENTS WILL ONLY OCCUR FOR LARGE CELL DEMANS
  * Day 13 (Sat): Feed 
  * Day 15 (Mon): Harvest for seeding experiements
