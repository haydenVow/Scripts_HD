Background  
We are currently in the process of generating WCB of  F_CHOMP09 cells
(Saltwater crocodile myofibroblasts). See lab book here: https://au-
mynotebook.labarchives.com/share/Vow%2520-%2520Team%2520Science/NzY2Ni4xfDEwNjMxNy81ODk3LTQ4ODgwL1RyZWVOb2RlLzEyMzAwNDc1OTN8MTk0NjAuMQ==.
After commencing the expansion, we were informed that production require a WCB
of >300M cells as soon as possible for their next batches. It was decided that
a second expansion should be started to protect ourselves against lost time in
the event that our first WCB expansion slows, or reaches is proliferative
capacity before hitting the target number of cells. This expansion will not be
continued if it is not required due to limitations of incubator space.
