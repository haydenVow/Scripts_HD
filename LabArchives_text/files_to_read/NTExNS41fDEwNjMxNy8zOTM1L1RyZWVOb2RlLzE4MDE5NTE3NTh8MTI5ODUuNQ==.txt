Reagent preparation

1\. Prepared 300 mL aliquot of growth medium + 150 uL of P38 inhibitor, stored
in fridge # 114 (door of tall silver fridge in main lab) 13:50 10-Sep-2021

Check confluence of cells under the microscope. If cells look like the will be
okay without a passage today, continue with a feed. Otherwise, send Avani a
slack message.  

2\. Placed the aliquoted 300 mL of growth media (already containing p38i) in
water bath   12:32 a/pm




Cell factory Process

  1. Unscrew white cap and remove blue cap and place aside.
  2. Removed  `50`  % of supernatant (300 mL) from 1 x 4CF by carefully pouring into a waste container with 300mL marked.
  3. Replaced with  `300` mL (per flask) of  `growth`   media by carefully pouring media through the white cap opening (alternatively you may use a 50mL serological to add media.)
  4. Place caps back and equalise 4CF by placing it on its side (blue cap on the bottom and white cap on the top, see image below:)  
  

4\. Returned vessel to incubate at:

  * [x]  37ÂºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)  
14:40

  

  * [x]  Thermo Incubator (ID #13)
