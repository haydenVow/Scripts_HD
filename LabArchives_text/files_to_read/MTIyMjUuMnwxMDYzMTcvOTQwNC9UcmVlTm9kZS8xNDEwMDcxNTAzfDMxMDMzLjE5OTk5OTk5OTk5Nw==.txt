Methods and Experiment Layout
  
  
Experimental layout

  1. Prepare 89mL of Hycell:RPMI + Nuvonis with Growth Factors (EGF & IGF). Place in water bath.
  2. Obtain 11mL (only 10mL needed) of cell suspension from Flask ID 13426.
  3. In Flask ID 13473: Add 45mL of media into an E125 Flask (ID 13473). Aliquot 5mL of cell suspension and transfer into flask.
  4. In Flask ID 13474: Add 44mL of media & 1mL of lipid concentrate into an E125 Flask (ID 13473). Aliquot 5mL of cell suspension and transfer into flask.
  5. Obtain a cell count.
