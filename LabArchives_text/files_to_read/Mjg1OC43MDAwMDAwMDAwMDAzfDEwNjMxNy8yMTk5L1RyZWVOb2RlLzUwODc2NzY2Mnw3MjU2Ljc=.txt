RELATED TO MILESTONE:  KR1 and KR2

KR1 (60%): Increase myosin protein content by 2x

KR2 (40%): Achieve >60% of MyoG positive cells

AIM/PURPOSE: To assess the cell adhesion and differentiation of DOLLY12 MuSCs
on plant based scaffolds provided by Tantti.  

HYPOTHESIS: DOLLY12 MuSC cells will adhere well and differentiate on plant
based scaffolds provided by Tantti after 14 days in ACF E6 differentiation
media.

RESULTS SUMMARY: This should only be completed if the data can be visualised
with a single graph/image, otherwise simply state "See Report".

CONCLUSIONS: What were the overall findings? This should be a concise summary
and not duplicate the information in the results/report. For example "We found
that Bovine MuSCs could only achieve a cell density 50% of that observed with
planar culture without undergoing precocious differentiation. These results
mean that we are currently limited to X cells/ml in suspension culture until
we find a way to inhibit precocious differentiation"

NEXT STEPS: This should be a dot point list of any immediate outcomes, changes
to SOPs, as well as providing a direct link to any new experiments arising
from these findings. Importantly, this section should also include any
potential DEPLOYMENTS to the production team
