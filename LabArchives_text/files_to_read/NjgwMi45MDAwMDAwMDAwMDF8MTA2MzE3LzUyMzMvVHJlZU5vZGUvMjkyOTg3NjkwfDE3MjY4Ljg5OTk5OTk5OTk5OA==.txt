Please check to see if plates are confluent:

Myo plates - if confluent, it is ready for bradford (Either perform today or
wait tomorrow if there is a low chance of the cells differentiating). If
performing bradford on Thursday, feed plates with GM.

Diff plates \- If confluent switch to E6 media. If not confluent, continue
with GM feeds.

Perform feed using below volumes:

Process:

  1. Aliquotted  12 mL  mL of  _E6 or growth_ Media 
  2. Placed in water bath   11:00 a/pm 
  3. Removed   100 % of supernatant from vessel. 
  4. Replaced with   0.5mL (per well/per vessel) of   E6 or Growth  media. 
  5. Returned vessel to incubate at: 12:06 13:34 (BUFFY MYO)

  * [ x]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (aviary cells)

### Observations/Summary:

100  % media changed on vessel(s)

  1. 8991-DAISY4-Cow P7-1of2 was tossed du to cell death  
8992-DAISY4-Cow P7-2of2 was switched to DIFF (E6 media), cells looking decent
and forming tubes
