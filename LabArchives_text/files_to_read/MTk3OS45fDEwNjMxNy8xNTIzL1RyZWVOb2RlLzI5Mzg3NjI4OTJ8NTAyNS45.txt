Background


At Vow, we use Immunofluorescence staining to:

A) Verify myogenicity

B) Characterise differentiation of myoblasts to myotubes

C) Identify different cell types amongst a co-culture.

  

There have been multiple attempts to troubleshoot immunofluorescence staining
protocols due to variable results in fluorescent signal in our samples. Some
of the antibodies that Vow has went through a freeze-thaw cycle during the
move from Kings campus to Vowse (Ralph Street), which may have damaged some of
the solutions. Due to the absence of a positive control in many of the
previous optimisation attempts, it has proven difficult to identify a true
negative opposed to a false negative.

We have ordered C2C12 cells from Cell Bank Australia to act as our positive
control for myogenic markers such as Pax7, MyoD, MyoG (myogenin) and MF20
(myosin heavy chain).

In this experiment, the plan will be to generate C2C12 cells in 96-well plates
and different stages of proliferation and differentiation, which will then all
be fixed and those plates can be stored at 4ÂºC until a select few wells are
needed as positive staining controls. This minimises the need to revive C2C12
cells every time an assay is started, and will allow us to know whether a
negative signal in our primary cell sample is not just due to faulty
antibodies.
