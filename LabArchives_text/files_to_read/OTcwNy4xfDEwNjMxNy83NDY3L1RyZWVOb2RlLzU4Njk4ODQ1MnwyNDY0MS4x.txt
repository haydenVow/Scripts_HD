### Process:

All cells were previously moved to 24 well plates. All wells were lifted and
moved to 6 well plates

Aliquotted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then
placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath for a minimum of 20 minutes
prior to use:

  1. TrypLE:     0.2mL per 24 well   
  2.  dPBS (for washing):    0.2mL per 24 well   
  3. Growth media (for seeding):     3 mL per destination 6 well     

Aliquots were left at room temperature before use.




Passaging of 96wp

1\. Aspirated the supernatant and discard  

2\. wash with 0.2 mL dPBS and remove  

3\. pipette in 0.2 mL tryple

4\. incubate at 30 degrees for 10 mins

5\. Meanwhile, pipette 3 mL culture media into the wells of 6 well plates  

6\. retrieve plates containing tryple and pipette up and down a few times to
ensure all cells have been lifted.

7\. Pipette 60 ul of the tryple into 0.2 mL tubes for DNA extraction

8\. transfer the remaining tryple and cells into the well of a 6 well plate




DNA EXTRACTION

Screening PCR protocol - DNA extraction of adherent CHOMP

1.    obtained the samples taken above of tryple and cells in 0.2 mL tubes

2.    Centrifuged cells down to form a pellet in the minifuge

3.    Aspirated off media

4.    Resuspended pellet in 25 uL QE

5.  Ran on the Bento using QE protocol

Version Change Log

NameChange Details  
V1 (original)N/A  
V2Changed all sentences to past tense to better reflect a hand-written lab
book entry.  
Various formatting changes.  
Addition of more detail to step 2, removal of step 3. Replaced volume
requirements table with updated volumes @Sep 22, 2020  
Updated temperature selection for mammalian/aviary cells @Sep 23, 2020  
V3Included a section for 'vessel type' in passage ID table Replace
'flask/plate' with 'vessel' throughout lab book Include at step 1 to take
image of vessel on the microscope  
Mentioned that dPBS for washing should be warm - step 3(2) and 5.  
Added timepoint at step 4 for when vessel is removed from incubator  
Include at step 11 to aliquot cell resuspension into microcentrifuge tube  
Included at step 10 and 13 time point for when cell pellet is resuspended and
when resuspended cells is moved into growth media.  
Included p38i in table of regent used  
Combined two dPBS entries in 'Media/reagents' table Added 'cell density per
vessel'
