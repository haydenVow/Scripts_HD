Process:  

  1. Collected E125s from shaker, wiped with ethanol-sprayed Rediwipe, and brought into BSC
  2. Using a 25 mL serological pipette, gently pipette-mixed culture for 1 minute to break up cell clumps
  3. Transfer suspension into 50 mL tubes. 
  4. Centrifuged 50 mL tubes at 300 x g for 5 mins 14:48-14:53
  5. Aspirated  75% (15 mL) of supernatant, taking extra care to not disrupt or aspirate pellet.
  6. Topped up each 50 mL centrifuge tube with 15 mL of fresh prewarmed media and resuspended cell pellet. 
  7. Gently pipette-mixed cultures, and transfer all cultures to E250 flask
  8. Took 100 uL sample loaded onto a 96 well plate according to the plate map. 
  9. Returned E250 to incubator 15:06

Staining

Prepared dead stain solution in amber/black centrifuge tube:  
\- 1 mL dPBS  
\- 1 drop Nucgreen AF488 dead stain  
\- Vortex for 5 seconds to mix

Prepared Hoechst stain (50 ug/mL) solution in amber/black centrifuge tube:  
\- 9500 uL MilliQ  
\- 500 uL Hoechst Trihydrochloride trihydrate (1mg/mL)  
\- Vortex for 5 seconds to mix. Solution can be stored at 4°C for up to 6
months

  1. Took 100 uL samples from each culture flask
  2. Added 20 uL of Hoechst stain directly to cells
  3. Added 80 uL of dead stain solution (dPBS+Nucgreen) to cells - accidentally put in an additional 20 uL of dPBS - total volume of first row = 120 uL)
  4. Incubated for 30 minutes in the dark at room temperature  15:11-15:41
  5. Made 4x, 8x and 16x dilutions of the sample in dPBS 15:48-15:49
  6. Centrifuged plates at 300 RCF for 1 minute 16:01-16:02
