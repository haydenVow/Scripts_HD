of MTT per mL)

 Protocol:

24 Samples

  1. Aliquotted 8 ml of DMEM media and placed in water bath ,    8:35-8:45
  2.  Retrieve N = 1 alginate from bioreactor and N = 1 alginate from the 6 well plate and N = 1 cell seeded zein from the 6 well plate
  3. Weighed out 40 mg of MTT (Stock #884) into a falcon tube then add  8 ml of the pre-warmed DMEM.  
  4. Pipetted up and down until re-suspended. Yellow colour should form. Cover tube with foil.
  5. Returned to water bath 8:50 - 9:00
  6. Removed the vessels containing the alginate samples from the incubator 8:58
  7. Using a sterile spatula, transferred samples to new wells of a 24-well plate
  8. Covered each sample with 2 ml per well of the MTT DMEM PRF media. 
  9. Protected the plate from light using foil and placed in the incubator for 1h (37ºC, 5% CO2). 9:05 - 10:30
  10. Replaced media with PBS for better visibility of the sample colour.
  11. Took pictures of the samples in the MTT plate using a phone/camera and attach below.  10:30  

  12. Imaged samples down the microscope (phase), 3 images per sample. Upload images below. 11:30

Note - purple coloration indicates live cells - samples which remain yellow
suggest no cells or dead cells

General observations:

All alginate samples showed a black stain with good cell coverage.

The zein samples had a purple tinge but not visibly black on either side. The
zein cell seeded from the 6WP control and the reactor did not look any
different from the cell free by eye. Hard to see cells under the microscope
because the zein blocked most light.

General observations:

All alginate samples showed a black stain with good cell coverage.

The zein samples had a purple tinge but not visibly black on either side. The
zein cell seeded from the 6WP control and the ractor did not look any
different from the cell free by eye. Hard to see cells under the microscope
because the zein blocked most light.
