## Electrode Lid Sterilisation

  1. The portable UV lamp (stored on the top shelf in the biomaterials area of the Main Lab) was sprayed down and brought into a BSC.
  2. The EStim 12 WP Lid with stainless steel electrodes (made as per EStim 12WP Lid MWI V1) was retrieved from the top shelf in the biomaterials area of the Main Lab.  
  
a. Inspect the wiring connections to the electrode to ensure no corrosion or
damage is present and all wiring is still connected as expected.  
b. Inspect the electrodes closely to ensure no damage or dissolution has
occurred to the metal.  
  

  3. The electrode lid was thoroughly sprayed down with 70% ethanol and brought into the BSC, where it was laid on its back underneath the portable UV lamp so that cell-contacting components of the lid were positioned upward, not touching the BSC bench.     15:04    

  4. The BSC screen was closed and the UV lamp was turned on by the internal powerpoint switch on the BSC control panel. The UV sterilisation setup was left to run for at least 1 hour (see image below).     10:50 - time    

  5. The portable UV lamp was removed from the BSC at the end of the sterilisation period.




## Imaging

1\. Removed the hook test clips from the electrode connection pins on the
culture dish lid for Plate 1 (7995)  
  
The test hook can be released from the pin by squeezing the spring loaded test
hook handle. It is best not to touch the metal electrode pins while doing
this. Hold the plastic culture dish lid for stability. If any wires become
dislodged and the operator is unsure about reattachment, contact experiment
owner for assistance   Jared - 0420881185

  

2\. Imaged BOTH PLATES, taking whole well images of every well using the zaber
15:34  

For information on how to use the zaber, refer to:

ad19527eee9e42ed9db96faa911d6536

Tips for imaging the 12WP are to use 8x8 imaging sites in the HSC site
generator, remembering to change the spacing rule to field of view with 60 um
spacing. Remember to build the MM List in the HSC site generator and confirm
the number of images expected (usually >700) in the Mult-D Acq.




## Media Change

1\. Retrieved   48 mL  of  E6 Media from a 90 mL shared gains and chains
aliquot in   1x 50 mL  falcon tube from the biomaterials fridge.  
  
2\. Aliquots placed in water bath  time 15:15

3\. Retrieved both plates from the incubator and placed them in the BSC.
Removed  100% of supernatant from both vessels.

4\. Replaced with  2mL (per well/per vessel) of   E6 diff media.




## Start Electrical Stimulation

###  
Attention: Connect both plates to the stimulator.

###  
0\. For instructions on how to use the StimJim for electrical stimulation of
cells, see the StimJim Notion Page.

###  
1\. Electrode Submersion

  1. Culture plate 2 (7996) was removed from the incubator and placed in the BSC  16:26    

  2. The regular lid was removed from plate 2 (7868) and the sterilised electrode lid was placed on the culture dish with the electrodes submerged in the media.
  3. The plate was placed in the  sanyo ID#80  incubator without any electrical connections  16:28   

  

### 3\. Connecting the Wiring

The test hook can be opened by squeezing the spring loaded test hook handle.
Connect the correct test hook to its corresponding electrode pin.  
  
The channels are colour coded. Connect the two wires for each colour to its
corresponding column. By convention, we connect the black hook to the left pin
and the red hook to the right pin. This is to maintain experiment consistency.
It is best not to touch the metal electrode pins while doing this since they
are delicate. It is recommended to hold the plastic culture dish lid for
stability.

Connect plate 1 (7867) back up with the original wiring and connect plate 2
(7868) up for the first time with the remaining wires.

The wiring should be connected as per the example images below:

.  



  

4\. Perform a Test Run

For detailed instructions on how to do this, refer to the StimJim Notion Page.  
  
This is to check and record the what voltages the cells are actually seeing,
using feedback function within the StimJim.  
The test run is set for a finite amount of time. Anywhere between 10 and 100
seconds is recommended.

  1. Ran the stimulation pulse   time   
Stimulated with parameters:  
  
S0,0,0,500000,10000000; 4500,3000,6000; -4500,-3000,6000  
  
Paste the above sequence into the Serial Monitor.  
  
  

  2. Paste the response from the StimJim in the Serial Monitor below. It should begin with 'Parameters for PulseTrain[0]'  
  
  
  
  

  3. Executed with command T0. Paste the response displayed on the Serial Monitor below. It should begin with 'Started T train with parameters of PulseTrain 0'.  
  
  
  
  

  4. Optional: Record the oscilloscope output here:

  
  

### 5\. Begin Continuous Stimulation

For detailed instructions on how to do this, refer to the StimJim Notion Page.

  1. Ran the stimulation pulse   time   
Altered the code to eliminate duration limit (so no feedback) and ran the
above stimulation parameters continuously. Executed with command T0.  
Once more, paste the complete response displayed on the Serial Monitor (as
recorded in the Test Run) below:
