Growth Media:

  * [x]  DMEM/F12 + 20% FBS + 1X P/S + P38i (10uM)

  

Prepare materials for thaw and seed:

  *   

1\. Gelatin coated  6  x  T175  flasks/plates with sterile filtered 0.1%
gelatin solution and then incubated all coated flasks at 37ºC

  * Time when all flasks placed into the incubator   12:47  

2\. Aliquotted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then
placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath for a minimum of 20 minutes
prior to use:

  *  Growth media (for seeding):    2x90mL in  2x120mL  containers
  * Time that aliquot was placed in the water bath to warm before use:  14:15

  




## Thaw and seed vial:

3\. Collected the cryovial from Liquid Nitrogen storage & place in foam
floater in water bath for 5 min  14:38  

Location where cryovial was collected from:

Vial details:  1   x  500K   planar culture and 1   x  500K  microcarrier
culture cryovials cells each for a total of   1M DOLLY12-15D11 cells.

`4. Ethanol sprayed & transferred the vial(s) to the BSC.`

`5.  Added  500µL of Growth Media (to generate a total volume of 1mL in the
cryovial) to the cryovial, resuspended the cell suspension gently to reduce
osmotic shock. `

`6. Collected the entire 1mL of cell suspension & transfer into the pre-warmed
tube of Growth Media. `

`7. Using a 10mL serological pipette, resuspended & distributed the cells
evenly in the   180mL of pre-warmed Growth Media (prepared in Step 2). `

`8. Another 90mL was aliquotted for the 3 x T175 for adherent culture  
`

`8. Transfered   30mL to each pre-coated  T175  flask/well, allow to rest in
the BSC at RT for 30 min  14:55  
`

`9. Transfered flask/plate(s) to incubate at:  15:25

Making labels

Note - You will need to increase the passage number by one. (i.e. if your
thawed vial ID has a passage number of 3, when you make a culture ID for you
vessel you will need change the passage number to 4 on Airtable.)
