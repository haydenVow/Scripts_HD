Stained and imaged cells adhered to microcarriers

  1. Removed culture(s) from the incubator and placed them in the BSC  `| 11:00 am/pm|`
  2. Swirled culture(s) by hand on the flat surface of the BSC for 5 seconds, the lid was quickly removed and 3x20uL samples of the suspension were taken while the liquid was still in motion. This ensures the carriers were evenly mixed at time of sampling.
  3. Transferred the aliquot(s) to separate wells on a 96 well plate and mixed it with 80uL of dPBS containing 1% w/v poloxomer 88 and 20uL/mL of Hoechst 33342. 
  4. Returned cultures to the incubator  `| 11:05 am/pm|`
  5. Left the 96 well plate to incubate at room temperature, in the dark (away from light), for 60 minutes.  `| 11:10 am/pm |`
  6. After incubation the wells were inspected under the Axio microscope, 5x objective.
  7. Using https://mia-capture.vow.tools/#/, 1 sets of same frame images using the DAPI and PHASE channels were captured for each well `| 12:18 am/pm|`
    1. Manually set the exposure time for DAPI channel to the exposure time seen when carriers are viewed using the automatic exposure adjustment [0.024ms]. (i.e if automatic exposure adjustment reads 0.002ms, set manual adjustment exposure time to be 0.002ms. 
    2. Fluorescence intensity of the UV lamp was adjusted until the centre of each microcarrier was barely visible compared to the space between microcarriers.
  8. Once images were captured, Image pairs were assigned a 'location ID' in MIA capture. (A1-A3, A1 = well 1, A3 = well 3) 
  9. Images captured were then selected for analysis using the 'uCarrier cell count' tool from MIA capture.

## Neutralize the detachment reagent:

  1. Added fresh, pre-warmed growth medium to the flask
  2. Mix the suspension vigorously
  3. Inserted the Taipan filter into the base of the flask, Attached a 50mL syringe to the opposite end of the metal handling rod. 
  4. While gently shaking the flask on the base of the BSC to simulate shaking, the plunger on the 50mL syringe was drawn, aspirating the supernatant and leaving behind the microcarriers.
  5. When the syringe was full, removed the cap on a 50mL tube and transferred the supernatant across to the tube before returning to aspirate supernatant until all that remained in the flask was the microcarriers in a thick 'paste' like consistency. 

  




## First wash to recover additional cells:

  1. Transferred 30mL of pre-warmed dPBS solution containing poloxamer 188 to the flask using a serological pipet - wash down the insides to wash any stuck microcarriers back into the bulk suspension
  2. Pipet-mix the suspension vigorously
  3. Repeated the aspiration technique outlined in steps 3-5 in the 'Neutralize the detachment reagent' process above. 

  




## Second wash to recover additional cells:

  1. Performed a second wash step identical in procedure to the first wash step outlined above. 

  




## Recover pellet, prepare suspension for counting and subculture:

  1. Centrifuge the tubes at 650 - 700 RCF for 5 minutes [14:12-14:17]
  2. Aspirate supernatants
  3. Resuspend pellets in 1 mL of fresh, pre-warmed growth medium
  4. Combine the cell suspensions into 1x 50 mL centrifuge tube
  5. Wash out each tube with the 1mL of the fresh, pre-warmed growth medium and combine with the cell suspension [total volume 5.6mL)

  




## Performed cell count:

  1. Aliquoted     20uL     of resuspended cells into a microcentrifuge tube for cell count.

  5. Aspirated and discarded the supernatant from the centrifuged cell pellet.
  6. Resuspended the pellet in 4.5mL of freeze media, aliquoted 9x500uL samples into 9 cryovials. [15:19]
  7. Placed labels on each tube
  8. Placed tubes in a Mr Frosty and placed in the -80 [15:24], second shelf down in the library lab (storage id #64). 




Stained and imaged Carriers after passage:

  

  1. Added 30mL of dPBS to the harvested microcarriers to resuspend them.  
  2. Swirled culture(s) by hand on the flat surface of the BSC for 5 seconds, the lid was quickly removed and 3x20uL samples of the suspension were taken while the liquid was still in motion. This ensures the carriers were evenly mixed at time of sampling.
  3. Transferred the aliquot(s) to separate wells on a 96 well plate and mixed it with 80uL of dPBS containing 1% w/v poloxomer 88 and 20uL/mL of Hoechst 33342. 
  4. Left the 96 well plate to incubate at room temperature, in the dark (away from light), for 20 minutes.   `| 15:56 - 16:16 am/pm|`
  5. After incubation the wells were inspected under the Axio microscope, 5x objective.
  6. Using https://mia-capture.vow.tools/#/, 1 sets of same frame images using the DAPI and PHASE channels were captured for each well `| 16:16 am/pm|`
    1. Manually set the exposure time for DAPI channel to the exposure time seen when carriers are viewed using the automatic exposure adjustment [0.024ms]. (i.e if automatic exposure adjustment reads 0.002ms, set manual adjustment exposure time to be 0.002ms. 
    2. Fluorescence intensity of the UV lamp was adjusted until the centre of each microcarrier was barely visible compared to the space between microcarriers.
  7. Once images were captured, Image pairs were assigned a 'location ID' in MIA capture. (B1-B3, B1 = well 1, B3 = well 3)

Observations/Summary:

\- Microcarriers in the culture prior to banking had a varied distribution of
cells per carrier at a glance. Some carriers looked very confluent while
others only had 3 or less cells when examined by eye.

\- The Taipan filter was able to aspirate all the supernatant from the flask,
there were no detectable microcarriers in the collection tubes when examined
by eye.

\- The cell pellets were also clear when examined by eye, no observable
microcarriers were present in the cell resuspension.

\- Prior to Hoechst staining the harvested microcarriers, the wells were
inspected under the 4x objective on the primovert. There didn't appear to be
any free floating cells in the media. There were also no notable cells still
attached to the micro carriers.
