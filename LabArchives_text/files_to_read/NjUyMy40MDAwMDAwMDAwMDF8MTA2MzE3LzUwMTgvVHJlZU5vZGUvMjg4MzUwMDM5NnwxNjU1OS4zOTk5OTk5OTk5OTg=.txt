Aim/Purpose


To assess the effect of electrical stimulation on C2 myoblasts/myotubes


Hypothesis


Repeating the stimulation parameters of 4 or 9 V/cm and using stainless steel
electrodes with the same seeding density as in previous experiments (in
combination with a newly selected cultureware coating to prevent
delamination), will produce increased MuSC maturation with increased MyoG and
MF20 staining results, compared to unstimulated conditions.


Technical Gap


Previous results indicated increased MuSC differentiation and maturation under
phase images, however MyoG and MF20 staining were not successful. This was in
part due to the large muscle pieces lifting off the base of the wells and
limited MyoG or MF20 visible after staining. The staining protocol and
technique were suspected for both the cells lifting off the base of the wells
and the limited visible staining. However, regardless of how gentle cells were
treated during staining, significant delamination was still observed. By
repeating previous stimulation patterns in combination with an "anti-
delamination coating", an increase in MyoG and MF20 may be seen.

software with the following sequence:

## Cell and Media Requirements

### Seeding

### Each well in the 12WP is recommended to be seeded with 60k - 80k cells,
which equates to 720k - 960k cells per plate.  
  
1M cells divided up evenly per plate is the recommended method for seeding out
these plates.

  

Media

Generally 48 mL of media is required per day to feed 2 x 12WP with 2 mL per
well of media.

The first three days of culture is generally anticipated to be done using
growth media, however the cells may reach confluence earlier and will thus
require switching to differentiation media earlier.

Since E6 has an expiry of one week, it is recommended to make up 7x50 mL (350
mL) of E6 in 50 mL aliquots when starting the differentiation stage of the
experiment. Black plastic 50 mL falcon tubes are useful for this.

Note - Please double check you have enough of all reagents before commencing
the experiment.  
Note -  Serum media will be used in this experiment (D/F + 20% FBS +1X P/S)
for cell expansion and seeding, seeing as we are already using animal
components (gelatin) and our harvests of ACF cells are typically much lower
than for serum.
