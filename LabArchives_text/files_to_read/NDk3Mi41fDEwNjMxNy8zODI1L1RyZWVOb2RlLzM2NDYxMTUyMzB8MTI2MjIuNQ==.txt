Prep of both hydrolysate stock solutions:

1\. Retrieve hydrolysates from the cell expansion fridge:

  1. Difco Select Phytone UF S# 3489 - reused solution from earlier experiment
  2. Difco Select Soytone - reused solution from earlier experiment  ~~  
~~

  3. Bacto Malt extract S# 3493 - reused solution from earlier experiment  
  4. BBL Phytone peptone S# 372 - reused solution from earlier experiment

2\. Weigh out 10 g of each hydrolysate.

3\. Add the 10 g powder to 100 mL of Milli-Q water. According to this
technical sheet the hydrolysates should be soluble in purified water and the
solution should appear to be clear to slightly hazy.

4\. Sterile filtered the dissolved hydrolysate solution through a 0.22 um
filter unit in the MAIN LAB. This concentrate can then be used to add the
hydrolysates into the growth media.

5\. Store solution at 4'C for 2-4 weeks.  

  

Prep of growth media:

1\. Prep growth media mixes and store at 4'C

*Growth Media: EMEM-alpha + 10% FBS + 1X P/S + hydrolysate (5g/L)

In order to make media with hydrolysates at 5g/L just add 5 mL of the
hydrolysate concentrate to 100 mL of growth media.

Process:

1\. Aliquotted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then
placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath for a minimum of 20 minutes
prior to use:

  1. TrypLE:    20   mL in   1x 50 mL   tube   14:10   

  2. dPBS (for neutralising)    40   mL in    1x 50 mL   tube  14:10   

  3. Growth media (for seeding/pellet resuspension):  
  7 mL (Condition 2/3/4/5/RPMI control/serum control) - 2 mL used for pellet
resuspension  14:10  
5 mL (Condition 6/7/8/9/EMEM-alpha control) - N/A for cell pellet   14:10  
 15 mL Condition 1 (3 mL will be used for pellet resuspension)  14:10  
  4. Times that all aliquots were placed in the water bath to warm before use

Note: if aliquots were placed in water bath at different times, record the
time stamp for each individual solution.




2\. Washed the flask(s) with dPBS.

3\. Added    3/5   mL tryple to each vessel/well and incubated at 37˚C for
20   min.

Note: Fibroblasts typically require 15-18 minutes of incubation with tryple,
slightly longer than MuSCs.

  1. Start/Finish time for tryple was   14:36    \-   14:56    

4\. Neutralised with    3/5 mL   dPBS (warmed) and combined cell suspension
into separate    15 mL   tubes.

5\. Centrifuged at 650 x g for 5 min

  1. Start/Finish time for centrifugation was   15:10    \-    15:15     




6\. Aspirated the supernatant(s)

7\. Resuspended pellet(s) in      2  mL    growth   media.

8\. Performed a cell count using the haemocytometer and recorded the cell
count data in widget or the Google Doc spreadsheet called 'Cell Count
Spreadsheet' (see link below):

9\. Total cell number was:

Serum control:    544,000  

Condition 1:   1,236,000  

Condition 2:   512,000  

Condition 3:   296,000  

Condition 5:   664,000  

RPMI control:   552,000  

10\. Seeded ~7k cells per cm2 of the flasks/plates. Note that fibroblasts
prefer to be subcultured closely together.

11\. Volume of cell suspension required for subculture was:   T25s (175,000
cells)  
1- 425 uL

2- 684 uL

3- 1180 uL

5- 527 uL

Serum/6/7/8/9/EMEM control- 330 uL  

12\. Transferred   required amount µL of cell suspension to the pre-warmed  5
mL  Growth Media aliquots.

Conditions to seed (from serum control):

  1. Serum control
  2. Condition 6
  3. Condition 7
  4. Condition 8
  5. Condition 9
  6. EMEM-alpha control

13\. Transfer cell suspension into (non-gelatin coated)  T25 flasks.

14\. Transfer flask/plate(s) to incubate at:  16:36  

  * [x]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (aviary cells)
