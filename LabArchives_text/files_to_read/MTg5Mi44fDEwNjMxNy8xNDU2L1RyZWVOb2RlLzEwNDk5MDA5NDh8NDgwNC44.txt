## Performed by: Shaleen  




Reagent preparation:

1\. Aliquotted     3mL  PBS for washing

2\. Centrifuged the secondary antibody stock using the benchtop
microcentrifuge for 10 seconds.

3\. Prepared Secondary Antibody mix:

  3.5 µL   Secondary #1 Goat Anti-Mouse (AF488) [MyoG]   (1:1000) +  3.5 µL
Secondary #2 Goat Anti-Mouse (AF555) [MF20]  (1:1000  ) +  3.5  mL Blocking
Buffer (PBST (0.1% Triton X + dPBS) + 3% BSA)  

If using AlexaFluor secondary antibodies then the max concentration should be
1:500 (typically used at 1:1000)

Vortexed antibody mix for 5 seconds and stored refrigerated away from light
until needed.

4\. Prepared DAPI mix:

   3.5mL  PBS +    3.5uL  of DAPI

Vortexed DAPI mix and stored refrigerated away from light until needed.

Process:

1\. Removed plate from fridge (incubated in primary antibodies overnight).

2\. Washed 3 times for 5 min with PBS at RT.

 11:00 - 11:05 a/pm

 11:09 - 11:16 a/pm

 11:20 - 11:26 a/pm

3\. Incubated the cells with secondary antibody mixture in the dark at RT for
1 hour.  11:44 - 13:19 a/pm

NOTE: from this step onwards protect from the light by wrapping plates in foil
and perform experiment in the dark.




Counter staining

1\.  Removed 2nd antibody solution.  13:21 a/pm

2\.  Washed with DAPI (1:1000) in PBS for 5 min at RT in the dark.

 13:26 - 13:34 a/pm

3\.  Washed in PBS 3 x 5 min at RT in the dark. (No Triton)

 13:38 - 13:44 a/pm

 13:48 - 13:54 a/pm

4\.  Replaced dPBS.

 14:02 a/pm

5\. Confirmed staining on microscope by imaging.
