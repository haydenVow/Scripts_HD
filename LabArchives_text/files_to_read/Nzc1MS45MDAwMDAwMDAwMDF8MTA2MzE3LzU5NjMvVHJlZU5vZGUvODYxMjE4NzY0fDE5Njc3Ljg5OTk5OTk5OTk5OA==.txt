### Prepared and aliquotted media

  1. Aliquotted 15mL of RPMI1640 media - in top minifridge next to bioreactor in 50mL tube
  2. Added supplements to each aliquot according to the below table:

IGF (uL)  
FGF (uL)  
EGF (uL)

Placed in water bath

Process:  

  1. Collected E125s from shaker, wiped with ethanol-sprayed Rediwipe, and brought into BSC
  2. Using a 25 mL serological pipette, gently pipette-mixed culture for 1 minute to break up cell clumps
  3. Transfer suspension into 50 mL tubes. Kept E125 vessels in BSC, as culture will be returned to this vessel after feed. 
  4. Centrifuged 50 mL tubes at 300 x g for 5 min 13:52-13:57
  5. Washed E125 flasks with 10 mL of dPBS
  6. Aspirated  75% (15 mL) of supernatant, taking extra care to not disrupt or aspirate pellet. 
  7. Added 15 mL of fresh prewarmed growth media to each 50 mL tube and resuspended pellet. 
  8. Returned cell suspension to E125 flask. 
  9. Took 100 uL samples from each culture and loaded onto a 96 well plate according to the plate map. 
  10. Returned E125s to incubator 12:00

Staining  
Prepared dead stain solution in amber/black centrifuge tube:  
\- 1 mL dPBS  
\- 1 drop Nucgreen AF488 dead stain

Prepared Hoechst stain (25 ug/mL) solution in amber/black centrifuge tube:  
\- 4750 uL MilliQ  
\- 250 uL Hoechst Trihydrochloride trihydrate (1mg/mL)

  1. Added 20 uL of Hoechst stain to cell suspension. 
  2.  Added 80  uL of dead stain solution (dPBS+Nucgreen) to cells
  3. Stained samples with 20 uL of Hoechst stain solution
  4. Incubated for 30 minutes in the dark at room temperature 14:50
  5. Serially diluted cell suspension by transferring 100 uL cell suspension to subsequent wells, down to 25% dilution  

  6. Centrifuged plates at 300 RCF for 1 minute 15:40
  7. Plate map of culture IDs in 96-WP for imaging
