Process:  

  1. Place media in water bath >15min prior to use 15:00
  2. Collected E125s from shaker, wiped with ethanol-sprayed Rediwipe, and brought into BSC 15:45
  3. Using a 25 mL serological pipette, gently pipette-mixed culture for 1 minute to break up cell clumps
  4. Transfer suspension into 50 mL tubes. 
  5. Centrifuged 50 mL tubes at 300 x g for 5 mins 
  6. Aspirated  75% (15 mL) of supernatant, taking extra care to not disrupt or aspirate pellet.
  7. Topped up each 50 mL centrifuge tube with 15 mL of fresh pre-warmed media and resuspended cell pellet. 
  8. Gently pipette-mixed cultures, and transfer all cultures to E250 flask
  9. Took 2x 100 uL sample loaded onto a 96 well plate according to the plate map. 
  10. Returned E250 to incubator 17:10

incubator 138 Library Lab, 37C, 5% CO2




Staining

Prepared Hoechst stain (50 ug/mL) solution in amber/black centrifuge tube:  
\- 9500uL MilliQ  
\- 500uL Hoechst Trihydrochloride trihydrate (1mg/mL)  
\- Vortex for 5 seconds to mix. Solution can be stored at 4Â°C for up to 6
months

  1. Took 100 uL samples from each culture flask
  2. Spun plate containing samples for 1m at 300g.
  3. Gently removed 50ul (50%) media from each sample and discarded
  4. Replaced with 50ul PBS
  5. Diluted Hoechst stock stain (1mg/ml) 1:5
  6. Added 100 uL of Hoechst diluted stain directly to cells
  7. Incubated for 30 minutes in the dark at room temperature  
  8. Made 4x, 8x, and 16x dilutions of the sample in dPBS 
  9. Centrifuged plates at 300 g for 1 minute 
  10. Prepared plate map: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1EJpk6IOlm6woHhoZII9HNkPr467Ue1giq1uLPHxXKnE/edit#gid=2059666874
  11. Plate ID: 10544 Link: https://ranger.vow.tools/#/session/recrJlhivxGA9Xq7V/images
  12. Imaged on the Zaber with 30ms exposure, then sent for to Mia for cell count analysis. Results here: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1YuTvXJXQQMIMwRZGeqNjdi20WeURg5FpM-1TJ-zrb1c/edit#gid=2066571586
