Scaffold mounting, sterilisation and coating

  1. Autoclaved moulds should be placed into the hood with: 15cm dishes, molten agar, mould weights, forceps (DONE)
  2. Place mould into 15cm dish and put sterile weight on top (DONE)
  3.  ~~Surround outer edge with 2% agar and leave to set and seal the mould in place.  ~~PDMS-coat the mould to the plate. (DONE)
  4. Place the moulds in a bath of EtOH overnight (day before experiment) (DONE)
  5. Dry the plates upside-down along the bevel of the BSC to allow aeration, (morning of experiment) for 30-60 minutes    :   am 
  6. UV irradiate for 60 minutes under the mobile UV (reptile) lamp - start     :   am
  7. Pre-coat with 0.2% Pluronic solution for 1 hour (to prevent adhesion), start     :   pm 


Cell Supply Harvest and Matrix Formation for Seeding


Preparation for Harvest

  1. Prepare 1 falcon tubes for cell harvest for 4 conditions of different collagen concentrations. 
    1. Completed calculations can be found here
  2. Media preparation for harvest and seeding: 50-50 RPMI/Hycell mix

  5. Centrifuge at 650g for 5 minutes: start   14:24 
  6. Resuspend pellets in  50-50 Media in the following volumes.

  7. Proceed to matrix additions below. 
    1. Bring out matrix additives from the fridge. 
    2. Bring out ice box from the -80 freezer. 

  

Matrix formation for scaffold seeding -

N.B. Repeat this gel formation for each falcon tube at the same time - i.e.
Add Collagen to all, then add DMEM to all etc. - BUT be sure to move quickly!
Refer to Figure 2 to visualise the workflow.

1. Remove pluronic from the wells.

Condition: 15M cells/mL (n=3) per condition (mL)  
Step 1. Aliquot cells+media for 1 condition  
(n=3 tissues)5.808  
 Step 2. Add total Collagen (mL)  
Condition A: 2.6mg/mL  
Condition B: 3mg/mL  
Condition C: 4mg/mL  
Condition D: 5mg/mL4.872  
Step 3. Add total 10xDMEM/F12  
  
(mL)0.588  
Step 4. Add total 0.1M NaOH  
(mL)0.732  
Step 5. Pipette matrix into each well 4  
  
2\. Add Collagen I (Devro: final concentration 2.6mg/ml) and mix well with
stripette (not resuspending):

3\. Add 10xDMEM/F12 and mix with stripette.

4\. Add 0.1M Sodium Hydroxide and mix with stripette:

5\. Seed    4mL    gel/matrix gently into scaffold ensuring good distribution
around pillars in the well.

6. Leave for    60-90    minutes to gel at 37°C - start time   15:56   

7\. Add     ~150mL   50-50 Media with or w/o TGF-b to entire 15mL dish, ensure
entire mould is covered.

8. Culture at 37°C overnight before checking.

Tips and Tricks for this protocol:

  * When pelleting cells, make sure they are completely dry
  * Flick pellet to dislodge before adding medium
  * Add Medium first to pellet to prevent clumping and cell death
  * Col1 is very viscous, pipette carefully - when adding 10x DMEM, it turns yellow
  * As soon as you add the NaOH, be quick as the Col starts to gel
  * Everything has to be exact, don't be tempted to add more cells than the volume stated if there are some left
  * Add cells slowly!
