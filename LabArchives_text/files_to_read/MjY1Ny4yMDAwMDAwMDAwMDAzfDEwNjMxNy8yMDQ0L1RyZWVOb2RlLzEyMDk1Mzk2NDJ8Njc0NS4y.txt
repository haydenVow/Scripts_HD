Process:

1\. Aliquotted   2mL  mL of  both E6 and HS diff media into  separate 15mL
tube(s). Placed in water bath   13:00 a/pm

2\. Removed   100 % of supernatant wells B2-B4 and C2-C4 on each 96 well
plate.

3\. Added E6 diff media (200uL) to Wells B2-B4 on each plate and Horse serum
diff media to wells C2-C4 on each plate.

4\. Returned vessel to incubate at: 13:11

  * [x]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (aviary cells)

  

  * Incubator (#78, Library Lab). 




Removed culture 7238 from the incubator and transferred to the main lab for
fixing. [13:34]

  1. Washed all wells on the plate containing cells with 200uL of dPBS twice for 5 minutes each time. 
  2. Incubated each well containing cells in 100uL of 4% PFA for 15 minutes [13:45-14:00]
  3. Aspirated and discarded the PFA then proceeded to wash the wells twice more in dPBS for 5 minutes each time.
  4. Parafilm wrapped the plate and placed it in the library lab fridge under the zaber, 4 degrees. 

  




### Observations/Summary:

\- Images were captured of plate 3/3 to track confluence prior to switch to
diff, cells appeared ~70% confluent.
