Process:

  * 96 deep-well plate
  * 15 mL falcon tube
  * 135 mL E6

1\. Using the tables below, first create 1 in 10 dilutions of the concentrated
stocks highlighted in red. To reduce buffer concentration in the finsl
mixture, these can be done in E6 media.

2\. Add the designated volume of concentrated stock to stock E6, making up to
2 mL of each stock in the NUMBERED WELLS (written 1-24):  
  
Figure 2. 96 Deep-well plate layout preparation for the serial dilution  
  
  
3\. In the remaining wells, add 1.2 mL E6 media.

4\. Using a multichannel pipette (6 tips at a time), transfer 300 uL from the
1X row into the row below. Repeat this process twice more until you have 4
rows of every condition from 1X to 0.008X.

Making the control media

There will be four control medias; 1) E6 control, 2) E6 + EtOH, 3) E6 + DMSO,
4) E6 + HCl

5\. In a second 96-deep-well plate, mix the following:

i. In wells B4 and B5, add 1.2 mL E6 media each  
ii. In wells B8 and B9, add 9 uL sterile ethanol to 1191 uL E6 media each  
iii. In wells F4 and F5, add 11 uL sterile DMSO to 1189 uL E6 media each  
iv. In wells F8 and F9, add 1 uL sterile 2M HCl to 1.2 mL E6 media each  







Observations/Summary:

Thioridazine forms a milky white precipitate in E6 when doing the 1:10
dilution, I've placed it in the water bath to try dissolve it
