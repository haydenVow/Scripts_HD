### Process:

1\. Took image of vessel with microscope on phase setting.

3\. Aliquotted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then
placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath for a minimum of 20 minutes
prior to use:

  1. TrypLE:     3    mL in      1   tubes
  2.  dPBS (for neutralising):     3    mL
  3.  dPBS (for washing):       3  mL
  4. Growth media (for pellet resuspension):     2    mL
  5. Growth media (for seeding):     30    mL 

Time that all aliquots were placed in the water bath the warm before use
13:08 pm

Note: if aliquots were placed in water bath at different time, record the time
stamp for each individual solution.




4\. Removed vessel(s) from the incubator   13:29 pm

5\. Washed the vessel(s) with dPBS (warmed).

6\. Added     3    mL tryple to each vessel/well and incubated at 37˚C.

  1. Start/Finish for TrypLE was   13:33 - 13:44 pm 

7\. Neutralised with      3mL    dPBS and combined cell suspension into a
1    tube.

8\. Centrifuged at 650 x g for 5 min.

  1. Start/Finish time for centrifugation was     13:47 - 13:52 pm   
Note* false start noticed at 13:53.  
Actual run was    13:53 - 13:58 pm




9\. Aspirated the supernatant(s).

10\. Resuspended pellet(s) in   2  mL    Growth   media    : pm

11\. Aliquoted     10uL     of resuspended cells into a microcentrifuge tube
for cell count.

12\. Performed a cell count using the haemocytometer and recorded the cell
count data in the Google Doc spreadsheet: Cell Count Spreadsheet or cell count
widget below

  1. Total cell number was:      328,000     
  2. Volume of cell suspension required for subculture was:     all        

  3. Cell density per vessel:       7,000 cells/cm2     




13\. Transferred     all    of cell suspension to the pre-warmed     8  mL
Growth media:    14:09 pm

14\. Transferred cell suspension into a      100mm TC treated dish    vessel.

16\. Transferred vessel(s) to incubate at:

  * [ X ]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (avian cells)




Observations/Summary:

\- F_KUZCO18 cells expanded from 1 x T25 to 1 x 100mm dish in DMEM/F12 + 10%
FBS + 1X P/S

Lower cell count than expected
