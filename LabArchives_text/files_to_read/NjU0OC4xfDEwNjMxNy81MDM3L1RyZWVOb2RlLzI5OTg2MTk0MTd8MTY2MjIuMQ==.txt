### Process:

1\. Took 2-3 images of each vessel with microscope on phase setting at 10X pr
4X magnification.

2\. Aliquotted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then
placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath for a minimum of 20 minutes
prior to use:

  1. TrypLE: 25mL in 1 x 50 mL tube 
  2.  dPBS (for neutralising & washing):  48 mL in 1 x 50 mL tube
  3. Growth media:
    1. 11 mL x D/F+10%FBS+1XP/S  

    2. 11 mL x E8_9C+rHA(OLD Richcore)  

    3. 11 mL x E8_9C+rHA(new RICHCORE)  

    4. 11 mLx E8_9C+rHA(Sigma)

Time that all aliquots were placed in the incubator to warm before use

  * dPBS and tryple:   11:30    

  * ACF (rHA(OLD Richcore)and FBS media:   11:30     

Note: if aliquots were placed in water bath at different time, record the time
stamp for each individual solution.




4\. Removed vessel(s) from the incubator  

5\. Washed the vessel(s) with dPBS (warmed).

6\. Added    3  mL tryple to each vessel/well and incubated at 37˚C.

  1. Start/Finish for TrypLE (SIGMA rHA & OG rHA)   : - :  

  2. Start/Finish for TrypLE (10%FBS & new rHA):    : - :  

7\. Neutralised with    3 mL   dPBS and combined cell suspensions into     8 x
15 mL    tubes

8\. Centrifuged at 650 x g for 5 min.

  1. Start/Finish time for centrifugation was (SIGMA rHA & OG rHA)  : - :    

  2. Start/Finish time for centrifugation was  (10%FBS & new rHA)  : \- : 




9\. Aspirated the supernatant(s).

10\. Resuspended pellet(s) in     0.5    mL  of respective growth  media  

11\. Aliquoted  10uL  of resuspended cells into a microcentrifuge tube for
cell count immediately resuspension.

12\. Performed a cell count using the haemocytometer and recorded the cell
count data in the Google Doc spreadsheet: Cell Count Spreadsheet or cell count
widget below. Added data to doubling spreadsheet:
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1We8TyzxliP8WTA0vCIwBTs3LNHsSLCO5C9Aj8zYYcsM/edit#gid=0

13\. Total cell numbers were ( ~~averaged 2 counts per rep~~ ) recorded:

14\. Volumes of cell suspension required for subculture recorded :

15\. Cell density per vessel:    7000 cells / cm2

  




13\. Transferred   above volumes  of cell suspension to the pre-warmed    8 x
5mL Growth media:

14\. Transferred cell suspension into the   8 x T25  vessel.

15\. Transferred vessel(s) to incubate at:    :  

  * [X]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells) incubator 80
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (avian cells)
