## Remove the Stimulation Lead Wire

1\. Removed the hook test clips from the electrode connection pins on the
culture dish lid for both plates (______)  
  
The test hook can be released from the pin by squeezing the spring loaded test
hook handle. It is best not to touch the metal electrode pins while doing
this. Hold the plastic culture dish lid for stability. If any wires become
dislodged and the operator is unsure about reattachment, contact experiment
owner for assistance   Jared - 0420881185




## Imaging

1\. Imaged BOTH PLATES, taking whole well images of every well using the zaber
time  

For information on how to use the zaber, refer to:

Tips for imaging the 12WP are to use 8x8 imaging sites in the HSC site
generator, remembering to change the spacing rule to field of view with 60 um
spacing. Remember to build the MM List in the HSC site generator and confirm
the number of images expected (usually >700) in the Mult-D Acq.




Media Change

1\. Retrieved   24 mL  of  E6 Media from a 90 mL shared gains and chains
aliquot in   1x 120 mL  pot from the biomaterials fridge.  
  
2\. Aliquots placed in water bath 11:59 am  

3\. Removed  100% of supernatant from vessel.

4\. Replaced with  2mL (per well/per vessel) of   E6 diff media.

5\. Returned vessels to incubate and connected the test hooks back up to the
electrode pins on the culture dish lid FOR PLATE 2 ONLY (_______) so that each
set of hooks connects to the corresponding wire colour and so that the black
hooks are aligned on the left side of each well and the red hooks on the right
(see wiring setup reference image below)  

  




Fix Timepoint 1 (PLATE 1 ONLY)  
  
Process:

Fixing Plate 1 ( ~ 20 - 30 min):

  1. Aliquoted  2 x 50 mL of PBS into  2 x 50 mL falcon tubes and  13 mL  4% PFA into   1x 15 mL  falcon tube. 
  2. Placed in the water bath and warmed for a minimum of 10 mins.    1:25    

  3. Removed media from each well and wash with warmed PBS twice. 
  4.  Added   1mL warmed PFA for 15 min:   14:50 - 15:05  

  5. Removed PFA (and add in PFA waste container) and wash wells twice with   1 mL warmed PBS. 
  6. Wrapped plate in parafilm and placed in the   staining   fridge for later staining.   time 15:35 




### Observations/Summary:

 100 % media changed on vessel(s)

  1. Plate 2

plate 8179 - media in well A3 is slight yellow. Observed under the microscope
and saw some muscle twitching. - this was the only well where the cells did
not contract and ball up. All the other wells had balls of floating detached
cells.

\- Plate 1 fixed for later staining.
