### Process:

1\. Took 2 x images of each vessel with microscope on phase setting (4X to
assess confluence)

2\. Aliquoted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then
placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath for a minimum of 20 minutes
prior to use:

  1. TrypLE:   20  mL in   1 x 50 mL  tube
  2.  dPBS (for neutralising & washing):   20  mL
  3. Growth media (for pellet resuspension):   5  mL
  4. Growth media (for seeding):   90 - 120   mL
    1. Note: I estimate that we will harvest ~4M cells, which can go into ~3 x T175s. Want to seed as close as possible to 7000 cells/cm2.

Time that all aliquots were placed in the water bath the warm before use
15:35  

Note: if aliquots were placed in water bath at different time, record the time
stamp for each individual solution.




3\. Removed vessel(s) from the incubator     15:51  

4\. Washed the vessel(s) with 10 mL per flask dPBS (warmed).

5\. Added   10  mL tryple to each vessel/well and incubated at 37˚C.

  1. Start/Finish for TrypLE was     16:10 - 16:22      

6\. Neutralised with   10 mL per flask   dPBS and combined cell suspension
into   1 x 50 mL  tube.

7\. Centrifuged at 650 x g for 5 min.

  1. Start/Finish time for centrifugation was     16:31 - 16:36    




8\. Aspirated the supernatant.

9\. Resuspended pellet in   5  mL   growth   medium    16:52  

10\. Aliquoted   20 uL  of resuspended cells into a microcentrifuge tube for
cell count.

11\. Performed a cell count using the haemocytometer and recorded the cell
count data in the Google Doc spreadsheet: Cell Count Spreadsheet or cell count
widget below

  1. Total cell number was:     2,460,000      (average of 2 cell counts)  

  2. Volume of cell suspension required for subculture was:     4.9915uL (all cells being seeded)   
  3. Cell density per vessel:   7000 cells/cm2     
  
Note: T175s are seeded with 1,225,000 cells per flask, so divide your total
cell count by 1,200,000 to see how many T175 flasks you need to seed. Round
down if you get between .1 and .5, and round up if you get between .6 and .9.
E.g. if you get 4,000,000 cells, 4,000,000/1,225,000 = 3.26 therefore you
would seed 3 x T175s.




12\. Transferred    5uL   µl of cell suspension to the pre-warmed   60 mL
Growth medium

13\. Transferred cell suspension into   2x T175  vessels.

14\. Transferred vessel(s) to incubate at:  17:50  

  * [ ]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (avian cells)
  * [x]  30ºC, 5% CO2 (reptilian cells)




Observations/Summary:

A lower cell count was measured than expected. The two cell counts were
consistent and the empty flask was checked to make sure there was not a
significant number of cells left behind.
