 3\. Added the following reagents to the water bath and media to incubator and
warm at 37°C 10:40

  




Process:  

  1. Collected E125s from shaker, wiped with ethanol-sprayed Rediwipe, and brought into BSC
  2. Using a 25 mL serological pipette, gently pipette-mixed culture for 1 minute to break up cell clumps
  3. Transfer suspension into 50 mL tubes. Kept E125 vessels in BSC, as culture will be returned to this vessel after feed. 
  4. Centrifuged 50 mL tubes at 300 x g for 5 min 13:52
  5. Washed flasks with 10 mL of dPBS
  6. Aspirated  75% (30 mL) of supernatant, taking extra care to not disrupt or aspirate pellet. 
  7. Topped up each 50 mL centrifuge tube with 5 mL of fresh prewarmed media and resuspended cell pellet. 
  8. Gently pipette-mixed cultures, and pooled cultures using serological and transferred to new flask
  9. Took 100 uL samples from each culture and loaded onto a 96 well plate according to the plate map. 
  10. Returned E125s to incubator 14:36

Staining and imaging:  
1\. Prepared dead stain buffer in 15 mL amber or black tube by combining the
following:

  * 1 mL of dPBS 
  * 1 drop of NucGreen Dead Af488 stain
    * Vortex mix for ~5 seconds, then stored in dark until ready to use.

2\. Prepared live stain solution in 15 mL black tube by combining the
following:

  * 4750 uL MilliQ
  * 250 uL Hoechst Trichloride trihydrate solution (1 mg/mL)
    * Vortex mix for ~5 seconds, then stored in dark until ready to use.

  1. Added 20 uL live stain solution directly to cells
  2. Added 80 uL of dead stain solution directly to cells
  3. Incubated for 30 minutes in the dark at room temperature Timestamp: 12:10
  4. Made 25% and 12.5% dilutions of the sample in dPBS   

  5. Centrifuged plates at 300 RCF for 1 minute  12:52
