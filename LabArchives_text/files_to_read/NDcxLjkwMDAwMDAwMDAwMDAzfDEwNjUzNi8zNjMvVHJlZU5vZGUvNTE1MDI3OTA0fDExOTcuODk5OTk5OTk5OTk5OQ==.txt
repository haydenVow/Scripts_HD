Experiment Goals:

  * Optimisation: Improve upon previous experimental findings and continue to find new ways to increase batch yield in adherent cultures 

Experimental Questions:

  1. Does the timing of VitC treatment effect the final yield outcome?

Reasons for Investigating these Questions:

  1. VitC treated cells appear to peel off the surface of the flask when a very high cell confluence is reached (This has been seen in Batch 14 and 15 experiments). However in roller bottles when no peeling occurred the increase in yield appeared to be proportional to the time in VitC treatment. Therefore we wanted to investigate if treating with VitC at different confluences would result in different yield outcomes due to the differing amounts of time of treatment (before reaching high confluence and peeling).

Experimental Timeline/Overview:

Original PlanAmended plan  
  
  
  
  
Treatment times delayed: Treatment times were changed due to uneven confluence
on the flask surface. Flasks sat on a slight angle in the incubator resulting
in some parts of the surface having higher confluence than others. It was
decided to delay treatment in some conditions until the whole surface flask
was at the required confluence.  
*Flasks were harvested when peeling was observed  
  
  
  

Full Experiment Summary:

P1 - Seeded from vials into 7xT175 for each conditions (total = 35xT175)

Condition timelines:

Set 1 - Control: harvested on D14

Set 2 - 1-day pre-confluence: harvested on D11

Set 3 - 100% confluence: harvested on D11

Set 4 - 1-day post-confluence: harvested on D14

Set 5 - Seeded with VitC: harvested on D8

  

Set 1 - Control:

  * 26/08/21 - Flasks had variable confluence, with all at 100% confluence at the bottom half of the flasks and about 70-80% at the top of the flask.
  * 29/08/21 - No signs of peeling/aggregation, flasks to continue in culture until they either peel or the last of the other sets is due to be harvested (whichever comes first).
  * 02/09/21 - The last remaining experimental condition (4) was harvested due to peeling, being the last flasks left not to peel, the controls were also harvest on this day (D14). 

  

Set 2 - 1-day pre-confluence:

  * 23/08/21 - Despite also displaying uneven confluence (higher confluence in the bottom half of the flasks and less in the top half), the treatment date was unchanged because these flasks did not require 100% confluence to be reached.
  * 24/08/21 - The ones treated with VitC at pre-confluence look more confluent than the non-treated flasks. Estimated about an overall 75-90% confluence. 
  * 26/08/21 - Flasks were all at 100% confluence at the bottom half of the flasks and between 70-90% at the top of the flask. No peeling visible yet. 
  * 28/08/21 - First signs of peeling observed in 5/7 flasks but the peeling is incomplete (see pictures below).
  * 29/08/21 - Still peeling in only 5/7 flasks but no change from yesterday in the 'completeness' of the peeling, decided to keep flasks going.
  * 30/08/21 - Harvested @D11. Peeling still incomplete and not showing any drastic changes. The peeling seems to be travelling up the flask as higher confluence is reached (After seeding cells were more confluent at the bottom of the flask compared to the top) so it was decided to harvest them rather than wait for complete peeling.
    * 7 days post treatment

  

  

Set 3 - 100% confluence:

  * 24/08/21 - These flasks were originally meant to be treated with VitC on Tuesday 24th August when 100% was expected to have been reached. However, due a slight tilt of the incubator shelf, cell confluence was not even across the surface of the flask (higher confluence in the bottom half of the flasks and less in the top half). Therefore, it was decided to wait until 100% was reached across the entire surface before treating with VitC.
  * 26/08/21 - Flasks had variable confluence, with all at 100% confluence at the bottom half of the flasks and about 70-80% at the top of the flask. Decided to treat on 27/08/21
  * 27/08/21 - Flasks reached acceptable confluence so were treated with VitC
  * 29/08/21 - No signs of peeling/aggregation, flasks to continue in culture.
  * 30/08/21 - Harvested @D11. Flasks started to show signs of incomplete peeling, starting from the bottom of the flask and traveling up the surface to the neck. It was decided to harvest these flasks instead of waiting for complete peeling. 
    * 3 days post treatment

  

Set 4 - 1-day post confluence:

  * 24/08/21 - Like Set 3 (above), the VitC treatment of these flasks was also delayed
  * 26/08/21 - Flasks had variable confluence, with all at 100% confluence at the bottom half of the flasks and about 70-80% at the top of the flask. 
  * 29/02/21 - No signs of peeling/aggregation, flasks to continue in culture.
  * 30/08/21 - Flasks were grown for a sufficient amount of time after 100% confluence was reached and were treated with VitC
  * 01/09/21 - 4/7 flasks began to peel. The peel displayed a more 'complete' peel than other conditions, likely because of the high confluence now present across the whole surface of the flask (Something not achieved in other conditions). 
  * 02/09/21 - All flasks were now peeling and were harvested (D14).
    * 3 days post treatment

  

Set 5 - Seeded with VitC:

  * 24/08/21 - The VitC seeded flasks are definitely growing faster than other conditions. Estimated an overall confluence of 90-95%
    * This confluence was also inconsistent across the flask surface like other conditions.
  * 26/08/21 -  3/7 flasks began to shown signs of peeling:
    * Interesting they all started peeling from the bottom left, suggesting cells reach a 'critical' confluence and begin to peel as cells were most confluent at the bottom left (I believe the shelves are slanted slightly this direction). They are all still adhered though and the cells at the top of the flask are at 100% confluence. Since the cells have not completely peeled off, the will be harvest tomorrow to observe if they fully come off. 
  * 27/08/21 - Harvested @D8 as the majority of the flasks were peeling
    * 8 days post treatment (seeded with VitC)

Conclusions/Answers to Experimental Questions:

  

  1. Does the timing of VitC treatment effect the final yield outcome?

Yes. Whilst all VitC treated conditions produced higher yields than the
control, there was definitely some treatment time points that performed better
than others.

In a ranked order from best to worst:

  1. (2) Pre-confluence: This was the best condition because it produced a much higher yield than all other conditions. Treating before cells reached 100% confluence allowed us to maximise the amount of treatment time whilst also maximising the amount of proliferation days.
  2. (3) 100% confluence & (5) seed with VitC: These conditions are fairly evenly ranked. They both produce very similar final yields and whilst (3) 100% confluence has a shorter treatment time, (5) Seeded in VitC has an overall shorter proliferation time. Therefore there are benefits to both conditions depending on the specific needs of the batch/production at the time of use.   
(Seeding with VitC appears to increase the confluence of cells faster than
other conditions, either by increasing the initial adherence of cells or
increasing their proliferation rate. This is likely why the cells peeled
earlier than the other conditions but still produced a higher yield)

  3. (4) post-confluence: This was the worst conditions because it produced the lowest yield and took the longest amount of time.

* It is important to note that because of the uneven confluence of these flasks for the majority of the experiment these results must be taken with some caution but can still be used as indications for further experiments.

Overall Key Findings:  
  

  * In flat surface flasks it is better to treat cells before they reach 100% confluence to achieve the maximum yield outcome. However if this is not possible, Seeding with VitC (faster) or treating at 100% confluence (less treatment time) are the next best treatment options.
