### Prepared materials:

1\. Aliquotted the required volume of each reagent and then placed all
aliquots to warm in the water bath for a minimum of 20 minutes prior to use:

  1. dPBS (for washing before and after Trypsinization), 100 mL per g Cytodex 1:     180    mL in         tubes. Placed in water bath at 14:32  

  2. Trypsin/EDTA, 100 mL per g Cytodex 1:     90    mL in         tubes. Placed in water bath from 15:03 - 15:20  

  3. Growth media (for neutralizing and pellet resuspension) 100 mL per g Cytodex 1:      100   mL in         tubes. Placed in water bath at 14:32   

Note: if aliquots were placed in water bath at different time, record the time
stamp for each individual solution.




## Remove the flask from incubator

  1. Stop the shaker
  2. Remove the flask from the shaker
  3. Restart the shaker
  4. Wipe down the flask with an ethanol-soaked wipe and place it in the BSC




## First wash to remove serum:

  1. Allow the microcarriers to settle for at least 2 minutes
  2. Gently tilt the flask to an angle of approximately 30 degrees from vertical
  3. Remove the cap and aspirate the supernatant using a serological pipet - keep the tip only 5-10 mm below the surface during this procedure
  4. Transfer half of the fresh, pre-warmed dPBS fro prewashing to the flask using a serological pipet - wash down the insides to wash any stuck microcarriers back into the bulk suspension, then replace the cap

  




## Second wash to remove serum:

  1. Allow the microcarriers to settle for at least 2 minutes
  2. Gently tilt the flask to an angle of approximately 30 degrees from vertical
  3. Remove the cap and aspirate the supernatant using a serological pipet - keep the tip only 5-10 mm below the surface during this procedure
  4. Transfer the remaining half of the fresh, pre-warmed dPBS for prewashing to the flask using a serological pipet - wash down the insides to wash any stuck microcarriers back into the bulk suspension, then replace the cap

  




## Add detachment agent:

  1. Allow the microcarriers to settle for at least 2 minutes
  2. Gently tilt the flask to an angle of approximately 30 degrees from vertical
  3. Remove the cap and aspirate the supernatant using a serological pipet - keep the tip only 5-10 mm below the surface during this procedure
  4. Transfer the fresh, pre-warmed Trypsin/EDTA solution to the flask using a serological pipet - wash down the insides to wash any stuck microcarriers back into the bulk suspension, then replace the cap

Time window each flask was agitated in shaker with Trypsin/EDTA:

Flask 1 (6454): 15:25 - 15:35

Flask 2 (6455): 15:30 - 15:40

Flask 3 (6453):  15:34 - 15:44




## Incubate flask:

  1. Stop the shaker
  2. Remove the flask from the BSC and transfer it back to the shaker
  3. Restart the shaker at the `speed required for detachment` \- see the table below.
  4. After `7-15 `minutes, stop the shaker
  5. Remove the flask from the shaker
  6. Restart the shaker
  7. Wipe down the flask with an ethanol-soaked wipe and place it in the BSC

## Neutralize the detachment reagent:

  1. Add fresh, pre-warmed growth medium to the flask
  2. Mix the suspension vigorously
  3. Allow the microcarriers to settle for at least 2 minutes
  4. Gently tilt the flask to an angle of approximately 30 degrees from vertical
  5. Remove the cap and transfer the supernatant to centrifuge tubes using a serological pipet - keep the tip only 5-10 mm below the surface during this procedure

  




## First wash to recover additional cells:

  1. Transfer half of the fresh, pre-warmed dPBS solution to the flask using a serological pipet - wash down the insides to wash any stuck microcarriers back into the bulk suspension
  2. Pipet-mix the suspension vigorously
  3. Allow the microcarriers to settle for at least 2 minutes
  4. Gently tilt the flask to an angle of approximately 30 degrees from vertical
  5. Remove the cap and transfer the supernatant to centrifuge tubes using aserological pipet - keep the tip only 5-10 mm below the surface during this procedure

  




## Second wash to recover additional cells:

  1. Transfer half of the fresh, pre-warmed dPBS solution to the flask using a serological pipet - wash down the insides to wash any stuck microcarriers back into the bulk suspension
  2. Pipet-mix the suspension vigorously
  3. Allow the microcarriers to settle for at least 2 minutes
  4. Gently tilt the flask to an angle of approximately 30 degrees from vertical
  5. Remove the cap and transfer the supernatant to centrifuge tubes using aserological pipet - keep the tip only 5-10 mm below the surface during this procedure

  




# Optional: sieve cell suspension to remove microcarriers

  1. Pass the cell suspension through a 40 - 100 um pore-size sieve to remove any errant microcarriers.




## Recover pellet, prepare suspension for counting and subculture:

  1. Centrifuge the tubes at 650 - 700 RCF for 5 minutes
  2. Aspirate supernatants
  3. Resuspend pellets in 1 mL of fresh, pre-warmed growth medium
  4. Combine the cell suspensions into 1x 50 mL centrifuge tube
  5. Wash out each tube with the remainder of the fresh, pre-warmed growth medium and combine with the cell suspension

  




## Performed cell count:

  1. Aliquoted     10uL     of resuspended cells into a microcentrifuge tube for cell count.
  2. Performed a cell count using the haemocytometer and recorded the cell count data in the Google Doc spreadsheet called 'Cell Count Spreadsheet' (see link below):

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1DPzKubYxfHmWogVPihC-
SSIBtIylyrBQE5kRX5Z8NtI/edit#gid=0

  1.  Total cell number was:      approx 1 million      

  2. Volume of cell suspension required for subculture was:      9mL       

  3. Cell density per vessel:     varied from 200,000 to 900,000 (approx)

Observations/Summary:

Cell harvest numbers were very low.

Upon sampling and Hoescht staining, it appeared there were still many cells
attached to the microcarriers after harvest.

To keep cells in suspension culture we may have to reduce microcarrier density
in 1xE125 e flask (To seed all cells from Flask 2 into a new flask, we would
have to remove 22mL of media from one equilibrated E flask, replace with
straight growth media, then add all cells
