Passage 1 - Thaw 2 vials into 1 x 2CF


# Procedure \- Thaw and Seed

### Note: Fibroblasts do NOT require Gelatin coated Flasks, and do NOT require
p38i.

1\. Place new seeding flasks into the 37'C incubator to pre-warm.

2\. Extract required growth media into aliquots as listed in the table below
and place into a heated 37'C water bath for 20 minutes.

3\. Select the vial/s for thawing. Note the location of the vial in Liquid
Nitrogen(LN) Dewer.  
Path: Stockyard v1 > Frozen Cultures > Select Vial/s (Use highest number
first, ie 62of62)

4\. Obtain selected number of cryovial/s from LN Dewar and thaw in the 37'C
water bath on a foam floater for a maximum of 5 minutes.  
*NOTE: Ensure to wear PPE and work swiftly whilst performing this this task. Ensure to wear cryogloves and face shield when handling the liquid nitrogen dewar. Ask a Vowzer for help if required.

5\. Spray and wipe the cryovial and growth media thoroughly with 70% EtOH and
transfer into the Biohazard Safety Cabinet (BSC).

6\. Slowly add 500uL of growth media into the/each vial. This will produce a
total of 1mL cell suspension per vial.

7\. Resuspend the cells gently and transfer all contents from the vial to the
bottom of a 50mL falcon tube. *NOTE: Dispensing suspension of cells on the
sides of the tube will risk loss of cells in Step 11.

8\. Add an additional 500uL of growth media to each vial to collect remaining
cells and add into the centrifuge tube. A total of 1.5mL will be in each vial.

9\. Resuspend cells thoroughly and immediately extract 50uL into a
microcentrifuge tube.

10\. Perform cell count (Refer to VSOP-007) from collected sample and use the
Cell Counting Widget (below) to enter data.

11\.  Extract all contents from the centrifuge tube and dispense into the
prepared growth media. Wash the tube with 5-10 mL of the same growth media to
extract remaining cells attached to the tube.  
12\. Transfer the pre-warmed flasks from the 37C incubator into the BSC.  
13\. Add required volume of growth media to each flask, ensuring the entire
surface is coated. Use the 'Bec Drop' to lay down the flasks.``

14\. Transfer and incubate overnight at 37C.

NOTE about seeding:

cells from the 10Mil vial were added to the flask and the flask placed in the
incubator then the cell count was performed. The cell count showed a small
number of cells so a 5Mil was then also thawed and counted and these cells
were added to the flask

# Procedure - Feed

# Performed by: LL

# Note: Fibroblasts do NOT require Gelatin coated Flasks, and do NOT require
p38i.  

  1. Turn on the water bath and set to 37'C.
  2. Aliquot  required growth media into a sterile container/s and place into the water bath. 
  3. Place in the water bath and heat for at least 20 minutes. 8:52
  4. Observe the cell flasks for confluence under the microscope using 4 x magnification and take images as required. Note: The confluence of cells must be <50% to perform cell feeding in P1-P3 and <80% in P4 prior to the cell differentiation stage. 
  5. Transfer flasks to the BSC and remove required volume of media (150 mL) from each flask (according to the Table below).
  6. Replace the same volume into each flask with the prepared growth media.
  7. Return the flasks to the incubators 9:31
