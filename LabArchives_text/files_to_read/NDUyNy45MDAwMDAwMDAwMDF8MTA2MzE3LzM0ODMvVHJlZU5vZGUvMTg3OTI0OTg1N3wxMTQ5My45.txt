Protocol run:

Plate/s taken out from incubator: 13:37. Plate 3592 was placed back in the
incubator at 13:45 (after calibration) while plate 3593 was being Zaber
scanned.

Start run: 1:51:05 PM

Observations:

It took about 1:10 min for to do the first part of the protocol for 1 well
(i.e. pbs wash and then add tryple)  

Run time: 02:36:41  

Plate/s returned to incubator: 16:30  




Observations/Summary:

Wells with >30 cells/well on day 7 from plate 7592 and 7593 were passaged into
96 well plate using OT2.  

This protocol had 30 min of tryple time for each well (rather than 20-40min
which we tested before). Results TBD (depending on cell growth).

After the passage, some wells still had cells attached to them.
