Process  
Initial digestion

  1. Gelatin and ECM coat plates  : a/pm 
  2. Transfer biopsy to BSC.   : a/pm `  
`

  3. Collect the liver (sever the portal vein and the connective tissue and separate from the body) into tube containing 15 mL of DMEM + Collagenase solution.
  4. Cut up the liver tissue to release the hepatocytes.
  5. Add 35 mL of Wash Media (DMEM/F12+ 1XP/S) and pass the liver suspension through a 70um cell strainer (use spatula to gentle stir tissue on strainer).
  6. Spin cells at 50 x g for 1 min.
  7. Wash the pellet twice with wash media (DMEM/F12+ 1XP/S) (50 g, 1 min). The supernatant should appear clear after the last wash.
  8.  ~~Count cells with a hemocytometer if available in the yurt lab, calculate viability based on Trypan Blue staining and re-suspend pelleted cells in DMEM/2% BSA at 1 million cells/mL. Spin once again at 50 g and re-suspend the cells in plating media for cell culture.~~
  9. Resuspend pellet in 27mL growth medium 1 and 27 mL in growth medium 2. 
    1. Pipette 3mL of suspension into well A1 ,2,3, of a 6WP uncoated
    2. Pipette 3mL of suspension into well A1 ,2,3, of a 6WP gelatin-coated 
    3. Pipette 3mL of suspension into to well A1 ,2,3, of a 6WP ECM-coated
  10. Repeat for biopsy 2. 

Explant:  
  
1\. Collect the liver (sever the portal vein and the connective tissue and
separate from the body) into tube containing 15 mL of DMEM + Collagenase
solution.

2\. Cut up the liver tissue to release the hepatocytes.

3\. Divide the explant into 2 segments and place into Well A1,2 of an uncoated
6-WP, with each well-containing 3mL of Growth media 1 and 2.

Culture the isolate

Note: The homogenate from each biopsy should be split into 4 equal portions. 3
of the portions should be frozen immediately as raw homogenate, while the 4th
potion is placed into immediate culture.  

  1. Placed xxxx of xxxx media in the water bath at 37C and warmed for at least 20min  timestamp   

  2. Took the falcon tubes containing 1/4 of the crude homogenate from each biopsy from the centrifuge (see section above) and resuspend in 3mL of pre-warmed growth media per tube. 
  3. Transfered to 1x well of a 6-well plate (use a separate plate for each biopsy) 
  4. Parafilmed plates to avoid possible contamination leak into the incubator
  5. Incubated at 37C and 50% CO2, Library Lab incubator timestamp

    * [ ]  As Usual (this is a repetitive task)
    * [ ]  Unexpected because...
    * [ ]  Need to be further analysed- pending QC results of the wash media tubes that held the biopsies after extraction from the main tissue sample
