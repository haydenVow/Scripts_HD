Observations/Summary


  * All flasks were inspected today to see if sheet formation had formed despite low seeding density.
  * All flasks had no macroscopic or microscopic differences between treated and control conditions and no sheet formation occured. A slight exception to this is some small aggregates observed in the MMC treated 5CS which was not observed in the control (see Figure 1).
  * A high degree of cell detachment was observed in the confluent T-flasks grown in serum from James H. This potentially suggests that the underlying issue behind low confluency may be detachment observed in larger flasks than well plates rather than issues with cell counting from cell supply. It could also be a combination of both in light of the recently identified calibration issues with the Cellaca cell counter last week.
