## Performed by: Kylie  




Perform feed using below volumes:

96-well plate = at least 200ul per well

48-well plate with inserts = 1mL

24-well plate with inserts = 2ml  
  
NOTE - A high media volume is typically required per sample due to the high
cell seed densities used, and thus the high turn-over of media nutrients - it
is recommended that samples are cultured in wells larger than their size to
accommodate for excess media

Process:  

  1. Removed all the media from the 24 wp (from adherent cells). Replace with 1.5mL of pre-warmed E6 media. to 5 wells of row 1 and 2 (0.6 and 1.2M cells zein), 4 wells of row 3 (1M adherent cells) and 3 wells of row 4 (control - cell free zein)  

  2. Add cups and tray to the 24 wp, in rows 1, 2 and 4.   

  3. Using a needle, transfer the zein into the respective cup.   

  4.  Placed in incubator   11:19 am  

  5. Returned vessel to incubate at: 

  * [x]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (aviary cells)

  

  * Incubator (# therm)
  * Lab [Main/Library/Production]




Observations:

Used needle method for the first time and was able to successfully transfer
the zein scaffold with minimal damage.

Media was yellow, reflecting the high amount of cells seeded.

It is good to note as well that a lot of the cells have adhered to the base of
the well (and not necessarily the scaffold). Able to see a slight white
coating on the base of the cell containing wells.

Refer to images in mia to see remaining dead cell in well. - it is possible
that the cells are dead due to the high amount of cells vs little media.
