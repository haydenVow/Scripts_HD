Objective: To have fibroblasts proliferating in suspension in a process that can be handed off to a CMO.


Company OKRs this quarter:

  * Ready to manufacture safe sellable products
  * Having a delicious first product - 50x international people to try first product

We need to help give food and production and manufacturing teams the skills
and knowledge they need to do this.

###  

Considerations:

  1. Multiple mammalian species
  2. Media that supports high density suspension growth
  3. HTP experiments for suspension
  4. Verifying that we have fibroblasts
  5. Being aware of manufacturing & QA requirements
