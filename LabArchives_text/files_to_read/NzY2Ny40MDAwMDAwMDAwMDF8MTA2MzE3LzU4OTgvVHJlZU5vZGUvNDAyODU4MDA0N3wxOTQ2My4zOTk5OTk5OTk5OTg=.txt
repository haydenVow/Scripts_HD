Aim/Purpose


Expand 1M F_CHOMP09 MCB cells to a WCB of >400M cells


Hypothesis


Continued culture of an initial population of 1M F_CHOMP09 MCB cells will
allow for a bank of â‰¥ 400M cells within 4 passages.


Technical Gap


This will be our first attempt to expand CHOMP09 cells from a MCB to WCB. At
this stage, we do not have any first hand knowledge of the proliferative
capacities of these cells with serial passaging and extended culture.


Method/Procedure


Experimental Plan  
  
1\. Thaw F_CHOMP MCB  

  * Warm an aliquot of DMEM/F12 + 20% FBS + 1x PS (growth media). 
  * 2 x vials of frozen F_CHOMP09 MCB (1M cells in total) will be thawed and plated into 1x T175 flask. Incubate at 30C degrees and 5% CO2.
  * Perform a 100% feed 24hrs post seed. 

2\. Feed F_CHOMP09

  * Perform a 50% feed with  DMEM/F12 + 20% FBS + 1x PS approximately every 72 hours .

3\. Expansion passages

  * When cells appear 80-90% confluent, passage following SOP_Passaging Adherent Cells V_04 using non-coated culture vessels.
  * Cells should be seeded back into plates at approximately 7000- 7500 cells/cm2.

4\. Banking

  * Bank WCB following Banking-Template_V2 when numbers exceed 400M cells.
