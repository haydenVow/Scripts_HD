According to this paper, CMFDA was used at a final concentration on cells of
0.25uM before FACS.

  

To achieve this concentration when adding 25uL of solution onto the existing
50uL of media within the wells, a 3X concentration needs to be made (i.e.
0.75uM) so that the final concentration on the cells is 0.25uM.

  

The Stock concentration of Vow's CMFDA stain is 5mM (in DMSO).

  

  

3 concentrations of CMFDA were prepared, in 2 types of diluent (dPBS and
Growth Media).

Mix 1: 2mL dPBS + 0.375uL CMFDA (1X)  
Mix 2: 2mL Growth Media + 0.375uL CMFDA (1X)  
Mix 3: 1mL dPBS + 0.375uL CMFDA (2X)  
Mix 4: 1mL Growth Media + 0.375uL CMFDA (2X)  
Mix 5: 0.5mL dPBS + 0.375uL CMFDA (4X)  
Mix 6: 0.5mL Growth Media + 0.375uL CMFDA (4X)  
  
  
25uL of Mix 1 was added to wells A22-A24

25uL of Mix 2 was added to wells B22-B24

25uL of Mix 3 was added to wells C22-C24

25uL of Mix 4 was added to wells D22-D24

25uL of Mix 5 was added to wells E22-E24

25uL of Mix 6 was added to wells F22-F24

of Plate #7631

Placed in incubator for 20 min from 13:52 - 14:12 pm




When observed at 20 min:

\- All wells with dPBS-diluted CMFDA had no indicative signal of cell presence
on the AF488 channel.

\- Wells with the lowest CMFDA concentration in Growth Media appeared to over-
saturate the light intensity in the wells. When the laser intensity was
lowered, the background still existed so no cells could be identified.

\- Wells with the medium and high concentrations of CMFDA in Growth Media had
to much background signal to see any cell presence.

  

The lowest concentration of CMFDA in Growth Media was diluted 1:1 and 1:3 in
Growth Media.

The 1:1 dilution was added to wells G22-G24.

The 1:3 dilution was added to wells H22-H24.

Plate returned to incubate at 37C 14:22 pm.
