In 3 x 50 mL tubes (1.5 mL from each tube is also for 3 of the wells in 6-WPs
that receive the same growth media as the E125s - they are replicates)

Process:

  1. Place pre-aliquoted aliquots in water bath to be warmed:  
Placed in water bath: 11:25  

  2. Collected culture vessels from shakers, wiped with ethanol-sprayed cloth and brought into BSC (if necessary, paused shakers by pressing the "play" button on the controller on the side wall of the incubator) 11:44 (6 wps), 12:11 (E125)
  3. Using a p1000 for the 6-well plate cultures and a 5 mL serelogical pipette for the E125 flasks, gently pipette-mixed cultures for ~1 minute to break up cell clumps
  4. Pipetted suspensions though 70 um cell strainer into 8 x 15 mL tubes  and 3 x 50 mL tubes (keep E125 flask and 6-well plates in BSC as cultures will be returned to these post centrifugation) 
  5. Centrifuged at 300 x g for 5 min. Timestamp: 12:13-12:18 for 6wp,  12:25-12:20 for E125        

  6. Aspirated 50% of supernatants (1.5 mL for 6-well plate cultures and 15 mL for E125 cultures), taking care to not disrupt or aspirate pellet
  7. Re-suspended all cultures in 1.5 mL (6-well plate) or 15 mL (e125) of their respective growth media (see plate map above). 
  8. Gently pipette-mixed cultures again before moving back to E125 flask and 2 x 6-well plates 
  9. Returned vessels to incubator and replaced in clamp. If shaker was paused, remembered to press play to restart shaking. 6-well plates should be shaking at 150 RPM and E125 at 120 RPM) Timestamp:  12:57 for 6wp,  13:12 for E125 flasks
