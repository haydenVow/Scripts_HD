Whole wells were captured using the multiwell zaber imaging system.

  1. Plates were removed from incubator 140 and placed on the zaber imaging stage. 
  2. 9 images were captured per well (3x3 grid, 50um overlap between each image) 
  3. Imaging 6 plates took 50 minutes, meaning media became slightly basic over the course of imaging, Temperature in the zaber was also 26 degrees. 
  4. Plates were then returned to incubate at 30 degrees, 5% CO2. 

  

Discarded the following plates which showed one well with signs of fungal
contamination.

12142- NFKB1A+CDKN2B

12147 - CDKN2B

12148 - CDKN2B

contamination appeared to be isolated to one well on each plate. The base of
the well was covered in a thick brown film while all other wells were clear.
