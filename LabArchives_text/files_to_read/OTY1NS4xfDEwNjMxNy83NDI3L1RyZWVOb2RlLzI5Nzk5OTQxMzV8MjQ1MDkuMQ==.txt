Cell Count  
3x50ul sample was taken from the flask. Diluted samples with an equal volume
of trypan blue (1:2). Counted live cells and recorded live count per mL.
Counted dead cells only and recorded dead count per mL.

Passage

  1. Calculated required media for new E125 flask with required media for 250 000 cells/mL in 30mL final volume (made up of old cell suspension and new media). Used seeder widget to calculate required volume of cell suspension
    * Required cell suspension:     10.6 mL     

    * Required new medium:        19.4 mL   

  2. Added required growth factors to media, calculated from Media Calculator
    * See media preparation entry above for growth factor addition volumes
  3. Incubated media at    37   °C for    30   minutes
  4. Removed vessel from incubator and performed media change/passage: <indicate which here by strikeout>
    * added newly prepared media and added cell suspension drop-wise
    * Returned vessel to shaking incubation at 37°C
    *
