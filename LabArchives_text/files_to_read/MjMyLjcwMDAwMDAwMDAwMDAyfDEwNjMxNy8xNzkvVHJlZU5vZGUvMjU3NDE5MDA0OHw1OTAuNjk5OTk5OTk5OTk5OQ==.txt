Process:

  1. Add ingredients for making 500mL of E8 (x0.2 P/S) as shown in figure 1 to a filter unit.
  2. To the same filter unit, add ingredients for turning this into E89C:
    1. 60uM ethanolamine: 1.8 uL of stock ethanolamine
    2. 1uM p38i: 25uL of 20mM stock
    3. 150mg/L albumin: 750uL of 100mg/mL stock albumin
    4. 40uM GABA: 10uL of 2M GABA working stock - use 1.0312g in 5mL PBS to make 2M solution. 
    5. 20ng/mLof mouse LIF from MesoKine: 100uL of 100ug/mL stock
    6. 2mM hypoxanthine: 134.64mg of hypoxanthine
    7. 1:1000 Trace Elements B: 0.5 mL
  3. Filter the media. Then add:
    1. 1:100 concentrated lipids: 5mL of chemically defined lipids
    2. 25nM EGF: 352uL of 14.2857uM EGF stock (Note: the only reason I added this later was because it needed to be reconstituted first).
  4. Make 125mL of E810C by adding the following to E89C
    1. 50uM glyoxylic acid: 250 uL of 100mM glyoxylic acid. To make 100mM stock, weigh out 0.092g of glyoxylic acid and add 10mL of E8 media. Syringe filter before use.
  5. Make 125mL of E811B by adding the following to E89C
    1. 250pg/mL IL-6: 12.5uL of 10ug/mL stock
  6. Store all media wrapped in foil in the fridge (4 degrees C).
