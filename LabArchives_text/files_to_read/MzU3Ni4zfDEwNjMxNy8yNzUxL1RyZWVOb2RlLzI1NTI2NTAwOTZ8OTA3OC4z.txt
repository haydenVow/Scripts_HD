Test 1: 13/07/21 - 15/07/21


13/07/21 Sterilisation and Begin Contamination Test

  1. EStim 12 WP Lid with stainless steel electrodes (made as per EStim 12WP Lid MWI V1) was thoroughly sprayed down with 70% ethanol and brought into the BSC where it was laid on its back so cell contacting components of the lid were positioned upward, not touching the BSC bench.     9:40  
  2. The EStim 12 WP Lid was placed in a new, sterile 12 WP base and placed under the UV lamp for sterilisation for 1 hour (Figure 1).     9:45 - 10:45 
  3. The EStim 12 WP Lid was placed on its back as before and the 12 wells were filled with 2 ml of  growth  media.
  4. The plate was placed in the  thermo  incubator without any electrical connections or cells.  10:52

15/07/21 Finish Test

Observations: No indication of contamination by eye or under microscope

Limitations: Short duration and antibiotics used in media.

Discussion: Experiment halted due to antibiotics used in media. Future
experiments should use antibiotic free media and use the BSC UV sterilisation
settings to avoid placing anything over the electrode plate which could
potentially contaminate the plate.


Test 2 - Replicate IonOptix Sterilisation Method: 15/07/21


15/07/21 Sterilisation and Begin Contamination Test

  1. EStim 12 WP Lid with stainless steel electrodes (made as per EStim 12WP Lid MWI V1) was thoroughly sprayed down with 70% ethanol and brought into the BSC where it was laid on its back so cell contacting components of the lid were positioned upward, not touching the BSC bench.     12:00    

  2. The EStim 12 WP Lid was placed in a new, sterile 12 WP base and placed under the UV lamp for sterilisation for 1 hour (Figure 1).     12:05 - 13:05   

  3. The EStim 12 WP Lid was placed on its back as before and the 12 wells were filled with 2 ml of  antibiotic-free growth  media.
  4. The plate was placed in the  thermo  incubator without any electrical connections or cells.  14:00

in BSC UV sterilisation cycle.






20/07/21 Finish Test

Observations: No indication of contamination by eye or under microscope.

Limitations: No pH indicator used in media to aid in detecting contamination
and short experiment duration. No pH strip used either to check the pH.

Discussion: At day 5 the EStim culture plate showed the electrodes submerged
in growth media without indication of bacterial contamination or electrode
corrosion (Figure 4). This preliminary test indicates ethanol spray down and
BSC UV cycle used for sterilisation of the lid is effective. Future
experiments could repeat this test with a longer duration and pH indicator to
provide more robust results.
