Passage

  1. Calculated required media for new E125 flask with required media for 200 000 cells/mL in 30mL final volume (made up of old cell suspension and new media). Used seeder widget to calculate required volume of cell suspension
    * Required cell suspension:     2.88 mL     

    * Required new medium:        27.2 mL   

  2. Added required growth factors to media, calculated from Media Calculator
    * See media preparation entry above for growth factor addition volumes
  3. Incubated media at    37   °C for    30   minutes
  4. Removed vessel from incubator and performed media change/passage: <indicate which here by strikeout>
    * added newly prepared media and added cell suspension drop-wise
    * Returned vessel to shaking incubation at 37°C
    *   

Location: Incubator: #.   78   , 37°C,      120    RPM, Library Lab
