Passaging of Clones:

  

Images were captured of clones on the 7/7/22, images were reviewed to find
clones that contained 90-100% confluence. Wells that appeared confluent were
selected for passaging Tryple passaging with 1/5 of the Trypalised cell volume
transferred to a fresh well containing new growth media (DMEM/F12+20%FBS +
1xP/S) (pick lists can be found here)

These pick lists were used to generate an opentron clone picking protocol. The
protocol was used for the cell passage.

Plates were initially loaded into the wrong order after plates were added to
the opentron origin positions that did not align with their pick list in the
protocol.  
  
Therefore on first passage the following plates filled the open in the
following order.

ORIGIN_A: 12612  
ORIGIN_B: 12634  
ORIGIN_C:12636  
ORIGIN_D: 12613  
ORIGIN_E: 12615

Plates were returned to incubate at 30 degrees, 5% CO2 after the passage and
the new culture was given a culture ID (Culture 12900)

The following day (15/7/22) The protocol was run again with the plates in the
correct order.

Origin_A = 12234  
Origin_B = 12236  
Origin_C = 12612  
Origin_D = 12613  
Origin_E = 12615  
  
This culture was given a new culture ID (12901)  
  
The origin plates were then discarded once they had been passaged.
