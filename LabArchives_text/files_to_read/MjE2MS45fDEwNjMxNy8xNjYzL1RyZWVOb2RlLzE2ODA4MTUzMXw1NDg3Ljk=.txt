Harvest of fibroblasts and seeding of petri-dishes:

Seed 16 Petri dishes with fibroblasts (2 different media conditions, 3 coating
conditions, 2 seeding conditions - see below)

Media condition 1: standard cell sheet protocol (last 24h ascorbic acid and
TGF added).  
Media condition 2: cell sheet protocol based on paper, fed every two/three
days with media containing ascorbic acid (50ug/ml) and TGF (5ng/ml)

Coatings: Collagen, Gelatin, Non-coated

Seeding conditions: Cells suspended in growth media, Cells suspended in PurCol
+ growth media (4'c)

Freeze-thaw

Media condition 1  
1 - gelatin coated, cells seeded in media  
2 - no  coating, cells seeded in media  
3 - collagen coated cells seeded in media  
4 - no coating, cells seeded in collagen

Media condition 2  
1 - gelatin coated, cells seeded in media  
2 - no  coating, cells seeded in media  
3 - collagen coated cells seeded in media  
4 - no coating, cells seeded in collagen

total = 8

Dish size = 100cm

  

Process for seeding fibroblast cells in Pure EZ collagen gel and media matrix
(4:1)

* Please note this procedure will assume you have already harvested the cells you intend to seed in the collagen gel and obtained a cell number. 

1\. Remove Pure EZ collagen gel solution from 2-10°C storage and transfer into
a BSC.

2\. Aliquot 4 mL of the collagen gel into 4 separate 15 mL falcon tubes.

* If the Pure EZ collagen gel solution is no longer required from this point, immediately return it to 2-10°C storage to prevent gelation. 

3\. To each 15 mL falcon tube add 1 mL of resuspended cell suspension. The
collagen gel is quite viscous and requires multiple aspirations and dispenses
using a P1000 to adequately resuspend the cells in the gel matrix.  

4\. Transfer the collagen and cells suspension into a 100 mm petri dish.
Moderately shake the dish to ensure the gel is distributed homogenously across
the growth surface.

5\. To form a gel, warm the petri dish in the incubator at 37°C. The beginning
of gelation will occur within 40 minutes but allow approximately 90 to minutes
for firm gel formation.

6\. Following the 90 minute gelation period add 9 mL of the respective growth
media to each of the 4 dishes to bring the total media volume to 10 mL.

* All future 100% media feeds will require 10 mL of media instead of 9.

7\. Perform intermittent feeds (100%) every 3 days to replenish growth media
nutrients.

Process:

1\. Before beginning the experiment pre-weigh out 16 petri dishes to ensure we
can evaluate how much the fibroblasts and ECM production contribute in terms
of weigh across all the conditions:

2\. After obtaining a cell count from the fibroblast harvest, seed cells at
10K/cm2 (~550K per petri dish) into each of the 16 petri dishes according to
their conditions described in the table in the experimental plan (at the start
of this lab book entry).

  1.  Seed a separate 2x 6-well plates (one of which will be freeze thawed and the other untreated) with fibroblasts to evaluate and optimise the live/dead staining protocol. 
  2. Seed a separate T175 flask for continuous culture

3\. Return all conditions to the incubator and feed every 3 days.
