Prepared to harvest the cells

  1. Placed frozen 500 mL bottle of Trypsin in water bath 11:40
  2. Placed 3 L of dPBS in water bath  11:40
  3. Placed ~0.5 L of growth medium in water bath  11:40
  4. Placed 50 mL aliquot of growth medium in water bath
  5. Once the Trypsin was thawed, transferred Trypsin, GM and dPBS to BSC and added Poloxamer 188 to a final concentration of 2 g/L
  6. Returned all to the water bath

Harvested the cells

  1. Once the Trypsin reached 37 deg C (usually after 30 mins) stopped control: 13:10
    1. Temperature control MODE to OFF
    2. pH control MODE to OFF
    3. Dissolved oxygen control MODE to OFF
    4. Level control MODE to OFF
    5. Exhaust heater MODE to OFF
    6. SUBS-B pump MODE to OFF
    7. BASET pump MODE to OFF
    8. LEVELT pump MODE to OFF
    9. Air MODE to OFF
    10. O2 MODE to OFF
    11. N2 MODE to OFF
  2. Manual stirring at 90 RPM maintained.
  3. Pumped out culture medium to the waste bottle 13:12 - 13:35 
  4. Pumped in 1.4 L of dPBS 13:39 - 13:55 
  5. Pumped out the dPBS to the waste bottle 13:56 - 14:20
  6. Pumped in 0.6 L of dPBS 14:25 - 14:35
  7. Pumped out the dPBS to the waste bottle 14:37 - 14:54   

  8. Pumped in 500 mL of Trypsin  14:55 - 15:01 
  9. Increased the stirring to 210 RPM 15:02
  10. Took a sample and imaged using phase contrast, some cells remained attached so Trypsinzation continued 15:16
  11. Took a sample and imaged using phase contrast, some cells remained attached so Trypsinzation continued 15:28
  12. After 10 minutes, added 500 mL of growth medium 15:45
  13.  ~~Reduced the stirring to 90 RPM~~
  14. Pumped out the cell suspension to the harvest bottle 15:52
  15. Added 1 L of dPBS 16:22
  16. Pumped out the cell suspension to the harvest bottle 16:31
  17. Stopped data logging 16:59  

  18. Pumped in 500 mL of liquid to resuspend the microcarriers 17:04  

  19. Took final sample for staining and nuclear ejection
  20. Turned off stirrer 17:10
  21. Pumped out liquid AND microcarriers 17:19

Recovered cell pellet and performed cell count

  1. Transferred 2 L of cell suspension to centrifuge tubes
  2. Centrifuged at 650 RCF for 5 minutes
  3. Aspirated the supernatants
  4. Resuspended the cells in 1 mL of fresh growth medium
  5. Combined the suspensions into 1 tube
  6. Washed down each tube in series with ~20 mL of fresh growth medium
  7. Gently combined and resuspended the cells with the wash
  8. Took a 10 uL aliquot
  9. Added 10 uL of Trypan blue solution to the aliquot
  10. Pipet mixed the cell suspension and Trypan blue, then performed live cell count by the Trypan blue exclusion method using phase contrast microscopy and an improved Neubauer hemocytometer.
  11. Cell count:
    1. Suspension volume 31 mL
    2. Hemocytometer images saved here: https://mia-capture.vow.tools/#/session/recLDLLbO3I8ZmfMH/images#group3

Decontaminated bioreactor

  1. Added 100 mL of 70% ethanol to the feed, seed, microcarrier and harvest bottles
  2. Pumped the 70% ethanol through the tubing and into the bioreactor
  3. Pumped the remaining base from the base bottle into the bioreactor
  4. Cut off the tip of the sampling tube and discarded.
  5. Pumped 50 mL of 70% ethanol back through the sample tube.
  6. Disconnected and removed the pH probe:
    1. Wiped with 70% ethanol
    2. Rinsed with water
    3. Wiped with a lint-free cloth
    4. Filled the storage cap with3.5 M KCl
    5. Replaced the storage cap and stored the probe upright
  7. Disconnected and removed the DO probe:
    1. Wiped with 70% ethanol
    2. Rinsed with water
    3. Wiped with a lint-free cloth
    4. Filled the storage cap with tap water
    5. Replaced the storage cap and stored the probe upright
  8.  ~~Disconnected and removed the level probe:~~
    1.  ~~Wiped with 70% ethanol~~
    2.  ~~Rinsed with water~~
    3.  ~~Wiped with a lint-free cloth~~
    4.  ~~Stored the probe in a thickly-padded foam box~~
  9. Pumped the contents of the bioreactor into the waste bottle.
  10. Clamped all of the dip-tube lines
  11. Added bleach to the waste bottle to a final concentration of 5 g/L sodium hypochlorite (0.5% w/v)

Cleaned the bioreactor vessel

  1. Added pH neutral, non-corrosive, bacteriostatic cleaning agent to the bioreactor, filling all the way to the headplate.
    1. Add 20 mL of Sonidet detergent to 4 L of tap water
    2. Open the headplate
    3. Pour the water-detergent mix into the bioreactor
    4. Replace the headplate
    5. The level should reach the bottom of the headplate
  2. Left the stirrer on at 270 RPM overnight.
