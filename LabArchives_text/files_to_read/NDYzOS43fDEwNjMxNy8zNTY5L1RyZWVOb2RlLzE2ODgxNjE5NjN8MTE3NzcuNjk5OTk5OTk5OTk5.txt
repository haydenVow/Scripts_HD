Process:

  1. Aliquoted:
    1. 1.5 mL  of  each of the growth media conditions above   

    2. 15 mL of DMEM/F12 + 10% FBS + 1X P/S 
    3. 15 mL of GM + HDAC 1 (0.1ug/mL)  

    4. 15 mL of GM + HDAC 2 (0.1ug/mL)  
Placed in water bath: 16:20  

  2. Collected culture vessels from shakers, wiped with ethanol-sprayed cloth and brought into BSC (if necessary, paused shakers by pressing the "play" button on the controller on the side wall of the incubator) 16:20
  3. Using a p1000 for the 6-well plate cultures and a 5 mL serelogical pipette for the E125 flasks, gently pipette-mixed cultures for ~1 minute to break up cell clumps
  4. Pipetted 6-WP suspensions into 8 x 15 mL tubes and E-flask suspensions though 70 um cell strainer into 3 x 50 mL flasks (keep E125 flask and 6-well plates in BSC as cultures will be returned to these post centrifugation) 
  5. Centrifuged at 300 x g for 5 min.
    1. Timestamp:16:30 - 16:35    

  6. Aspirated 50% of supernatants, taking care to not disrupt or aspirate pellet
  7. Replaced fresh, warmed media in all cultures
  8. Gently pipette-mixed cultures again before moving back to E125 flask and 2 x 6-well plates 
  9. Took 100 uL samples from each culture and placed in separate wells of 96-WP
  10. Returned vessels to incubator and replaced in clamp. If shaker was paused, remembered to press play to restart shaking. 6-well plates should be shaking at 150 RPM and E125 at 120 RPM)
    1. Timestamp 6 wp: 17:00
    2. Timestamp E125  16:55    

  * Incubator (#116 & #81), Lab [Main]




Stain and image:

  1. Took 100 uL samples of each culture, transferred to wells in 96 well plate
  2. Prepared stain buffer of 4 drops of NucBlue and 4 drops of NucGreen reagents in 4 mL of dPBS
  3. Added 100 uL of stain buffer to the samples, as well as two columns adjacent to the samples
  4. Pipet mixed the sample well (50% dilution well),
  5. Transferred 100 uL to the well in the next column (25% dilution well), then pipet mixed at least 5 times
  6. Transferred 100 uL to the well in the next column (12.5% dilution well), then pipet mixed at least 5 times
  7. Transferred 100 uL from the 12.5% dilution well to waste
  8. Incubated at room temperature in the dark for 20 minutes   17:00 - 17:30    

  9. Centrifuged at 650 RCF for 1 minute  
  10. Took images of each well on the blue and green fluorescence channels using the Zaber on  Culture ID 7820 EPIC21699
