Process

  1. Culture vessels removed from the incubator 
  2. Each vessel was examined under the microscope and imaged at 10x and 20x magnifications. Observations were recorded in the table bellow.
  3. Culture vessels returned to library lab incubator 77, 37C and 5% CO2

cells no longer spindle shaped but instead for large triangles or flattened
circles.
