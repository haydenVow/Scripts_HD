Passaged the 20% serum adapted CHOMP cells into new vessels today.  
  
Cells were passaged as normal out of 2xT175 flasks (ID's 13035-13036)

  1. Cells were washed with sterile filtered dPBS 
  2. Wash was removed and cells were covered with 10mL of sterile filtered tryple-EDTA per flask. 
  3. Cells were incubated for 30 minutes at 5% CO2 for 10 minutes. 
  4. Cells were collected into 50mL tubes and flasks were washed down with equal volumes of dPBS to tryple 
  5. Washes were also collected to the same tubes 
  6. Cells were centrifuged at 650g for 5 minutes to pellet 
  7. Supernatant was discarded and cells were resuspended in 20mL of growth media (made using 20% serum containing media diluted 1:2 with additional DMEM/F12 + 1xP/S media) 
  8. 10uL of cells were taken in triplicate for a trypan blue stain at a 1:2 dilution followed by a count under a hemocytometer. 

Cells Count = 7,480,000, 6,280,000 and 8,520,000.

Average count = 7,426,667 in 10mL

1.66mL of cell suspension was then seeded into a T175 flask containing 30mL of
growth media (Seeding density 7040 cells/cm^2, 1,232,826 cells total. culture
ID 13119

2x volumes of 3.66mL of cell suspension were used to seed two additional T175
flasks containing 30mL of growth media (~14,090 cells/cm^2, 2,465,653 cells
total per flask). These cells will be used for banking prior to continuous
culture passaging. culture ID's 13121-13122
