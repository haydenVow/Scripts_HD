# Procedure

  1. Aliquotted: 
    1. 3.5 mL of 10C medium
    2. 5.5 mL of 10C medium (placed in waterbath. Timestamp: 13:52)
    3. 3.5 mL of D/F+20%FBS+1xP/S medium 
    4. 5.5 mL of D/F+20%FBS+1xP/S medium (placed in waterbath. Timestamp: 13:52)
  2. Added 70 uL of Hoechst (20 uL/mL) to each 3.5 mL media aliquot 
  3. Sterile filtered each 3.5 mL aliquot into 2 x sterile media troughs 
  4. Pipetted 200 uL/well of each media into the relevant wells (mirror setup of culture plate) of a new 96-well plate 
  5. Wrapped 96WP in foil and placed in incubator. Timestamp: 14:00
  6. After ~20 minutes, retrieved culture plate and 96WP with Hoechst media from incubator 
  7. Using sterile tweezers, moved each scaffold from the culture plate into the 96WP with Hoechst media 
  8. Returned plates to incubator. Left Hoechst plate to incubate for 10 minutes. Timestamp: 14:28 - 14:38
  9. After 10 minutes, aspirated media from all scaffolds, and replaced with 50 uL of fresh, warmed media (from waterbath) 
  10. Zaber imaged (see next lab book) 
  11. If scaffolds look very confluent and cells have adhered nicely, then top up media to 230 uL per scaffold and replace in incubator (take to Day 7 to assess cell adhesion) 
  12. If scaffolds do not look very confluent, dispose of plate after imaging.
