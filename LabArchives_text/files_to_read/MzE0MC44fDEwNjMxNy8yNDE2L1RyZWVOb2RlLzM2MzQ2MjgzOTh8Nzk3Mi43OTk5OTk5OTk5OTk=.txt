Process:

1\. Aliquotted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then
placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath for a minimum of 20 minutes
prior to use:

  1.  Growth media (for seeding):   30 mL in  1 x 50 mL  tube
  2.  Time that all aliquot was placed in the water bath to warm before use:   12:00  

2\. Collected the cryovial from Liquid Nitrogen storage & place in foam
floater in water bath for 5 min  12:19 - 12:24

Location where cryovial was collected from:

Brew

Tower #5  

Box #1  

Vial location: A1  

Vial ID: 3905 (2 of 32)  




3\. Ethanol sprayed & transferred the vial(s) to the BSC.

4\. Added   µL of Growth Media (to generate a total volume of 1mL in the
cryovial) to the cryovial, resuspended the cell suspension gently to reduce
osmotic shock.

5\. Collected the entire 1mL of cell suspension & transfer into the pre-warmed
tube of Growth Media (prepared in Step 2).




6\. Using a serological pipette, resuspended & distributed the cells evenly in
the  30 mL of pre-warmed Growth Media (prepared in Step 2).

7\. Seeded cells into (non-gelatin coated) flasks/wells at approximately 7k
cells per cm2.

  1. e.g. 1 million fibroblasts can be seeded into 1 x T175

8\. Transfered  30 mL to each  T175  flask

9\. Transfered flask/plate(s) to incubate at:

  * [x]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells) - although these are avian cells, incubating them at 37'C 
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (aviarn cells)




SOPs used:

  * SOP_Thawing Cells Into Adherent Culture V_02
