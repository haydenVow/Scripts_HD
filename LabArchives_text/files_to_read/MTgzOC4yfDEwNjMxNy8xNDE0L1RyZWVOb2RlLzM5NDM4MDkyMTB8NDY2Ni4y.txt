  1. Gelatin (ID:) coat 24 well plate and placed in incubator     14:45  \-  17:02 pm 

Perfrome harvest: Link to Harvest lab book:  

  1.  Total cell number was:       37M      

  2. Volume of cell suspension required for subculture was:      0.485 mL      

  3. Total cells per well: 40000 cells/well 
  4. Total cells required for a 24 well plate:  960000cells 

  1. Transferred      0.485 mL     µl of cell suspension to the pre-warmed       12    mL Growth media:      17:03  pm 
  2. Transferred cell suspension into the pre-gelatin coated       24 well plate     vessel.
  3. Left at RT in the BSC for 30 min to allow cells to settle      17:05  \-  17:35 pm  
  4. Transferred vessel(s) to incubate at: 

  * [x]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (avian cells)
