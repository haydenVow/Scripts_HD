Aim/Purpose


To expand WCB2 vials from both planar and microcarrier cultures over at least
10x doublings on microcarriers, terminating in the Biostat A 2 L bioreactor.


Hypothesis


Using the Taipan harvest method will enable more consistent harvests with
greater harvest yield, resulting in successful WCB2 expansion on microcarriers
up to a 2 L stir tank bioreactor.


Technical Gap


Previous WCB2 expansions have shown some cell growth on microcarriers, but
have been hampered by poor harvest yields. The Taipan is a tool which enables
syringes to suck up the cells and media after trypsinisation, while filtering
out the cytodex microcarriers. This method is expected to increase harvest
yields, improving serial passaging and enabling successful WCB2 expansion on
microcarriers, however this has not yet been demonstrated.


Method/Procedure


# Cell Expansion

## Schedule

  1. Thaw 1x vial from planar WCB2 into T175 flasks and 1x vial from microcarrier WCB2 into T175 flasks  

  2. Feed flasks
  3. After at least 2x doublings, passage planar WCB2 cells into E125 flasks and a differentiation assay, passage microcarrier WCB2 cells into E125 flasks and a differentiation assay 
  4. Microcarrier culture:
    1. Feed flasks
    2. After at least 2x doublings, passage planar WCB2 cells into E500 flasks and passage microcarrier WCB2 cells into E500 flasks
    3. Feed flasks
    4. After at least 2x doublings, passage planar WCB2 cells into E2000 flasks and passage microcarrier WCB2 cells into E2000 flasks
    5. Feed flasks
    6. After at least 2x doublings, passage best performing flask(s) into Biostat A 2 L batch  

    7. Feed Biostat  

    8. After at least 2x doublings, harvest cells (and reuse if possible)

## Proliferation on Microcarriers  

  1. Microcarriers should be added at 4.5-5 g/L (dry mass) Cytodex 1 (for a hydrated specific surface area of ~20 cm2/mL)
  2. Microcarriers should be washed and resuspended in fresh culture medium
  3. Microcarriers should be seeded at ~3 cells/microcarrier (which is ~3,000 cells/cm2)
  4. Cultures should be analyzed on day 0, feed days and harvest days
  5. Cultures should be analyzed using BOTH nuclear ejection AND MIA if possible  
  




# Differentiation Assay Protocol

Perform differentiation assay as per normal. If possible, use starvation
method instead of daily medium change method. If possible, use C2C12 control
plate during staining.

Recommended time points (after switch to diff media): 24h, 48h, 96h, 144h,
336h. Minimum recommended time points: 24h, 96h, 144h.

  * Differentiation assay
    1. A plate should include wells for the cells from planar WCB2 and the cells from the microcarrier WCB2
    2. The plates should test 3 different diff media:
      1. E6
      2. 2% HS
      3. Starvation in growth medium
    3. A column (8 wells) should be seeded for each condition
    4. There are 2x cell types and 3x different media for a total of 6x conditions (and therefore 6x columns)  

  

[DAY -2] - Seed 5 x 96 well plates with 5,000 cells/well from in 140 uL/well
using appropriate serum-containing media (i.e. 35,710 cells/mL)

  1.  Gelatin Coating: Add 100uL/well of 0.1% gelatin solution (sterile filtered) to the first 3 lanes of wells of 5 x 96-well plates. Incubate plates for at least 1 hr (37ºC, 5% CO2).
  2. Seeding: Seed 5-10k cells per well in 140uL of serum-containing media. 10k cells should be sufficiently confluent to change to diff media after 24h. 7.5k cells should be sufficiently confluent to change to diff media after 3 days. 
  3. 5 x 96 well plates, with 3 lanes per plate should be used. 600k-1.2million cells are needed for the assay.
  4. Seed columns #2, #3, and #4. Put PBS into columns #1 and #5 to minimise the edge effect.
  5. Label 5 x 96 well plates as a designated time point: 24 h, 48 h, 96 h, 144 h and 336 h. 
  6. Incubate plates at 37ºC, 5% CO2.

[Day 0] \- When cells are 100% confluent, change to differentiation media on 5
x (quarter) 96-well plates.

  1. 2 columns per plate should receive 140uL of E6 media per well.
  2. 1 column per plate should receive 140uL of DMEM + 2%HS per well. 
  3. Media change should happen slowly and all
  4. Return plates to incubate at 37ºC, 5% CO2.
