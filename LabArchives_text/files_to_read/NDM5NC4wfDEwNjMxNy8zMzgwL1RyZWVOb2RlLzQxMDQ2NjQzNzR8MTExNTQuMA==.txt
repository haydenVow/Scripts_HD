+ 5mL Pen/Strep (ALiquot #6117) *Note, Sv2 is not working so no Mix ID was

  1. RS: Prepared 22mL MDB (11 mL/biopsy) by adding 750 U/mL of collagenase II powder in wash media.

    2. Note: MDB must be prepare fresh on the day of tissue digestion. 

    3. Sterilized with 0.22 μm filter. Made 11mL aliquots in 50 mL tubes and stored in fridge until use.

  2. Prepared in hood: Scalpels, tweezers, blotting paper, dissection scissors, 100mm plates, Parafilm.



  1. Collect muscle biopsy, transfer to BSC.   `16:42 PM   
`

  2. Transfer the biopsy to 1 x 10cm plate containing 2mL WM to perform the following steps:
  3. Cut each biopsy into 4-5 pieces using dissection scissors.
  4. Transfer pieces from each biopsy to a fresh 100mm plate (or use the lids of the initial dishes).

Note* Perform all following steps for each biopsy provided.

Person: Rebecca Screnci  
Biopsy # 6  
  
Blot the biopsy to remove any blood, and then quickly cut off any adherent
fat/connective tissue (don't spend ages doing this, just anything large
clearly hanging off). Get the biopsy into a dish sooner rather later to
prevent it from drying out.  
  
Add 2mL of MDB solution to the lid. Set timer for 12 mins. Mince muscle  16:49
`-  17:01  ` using 2 x disposable scalpels (Brand, Cat#, Lot#).  
  
Transfer small pieces of the tissue to the lid and using forceps to hold the
tissue at one end and two scalpels, mince each muscle piece until it is
slushed sufficiently. Then proceed to transfer the next piece, repeat until
all are homogeneously slushed.

  
  
Observations:  
  
Transfer the minced muscle to a 50 mL conical tube up to 10mL of MDB (freshly
prepared and filtered).

  
  
  
Seal the tube well with Parafilm and incubate in a 37°C INCUBATOR  with
agitation (60rpm) for 1 hour.    17:09  `- 18:09  ``  ` Tubes should be
positioned horizontally along the shaking path and completely submerged in
water. Use weights to keep the tubes submerged.  
  
This protocol is normally performed with 60-70rpm agitation. Due to the fact
that the water bath shaker will be occupied by the 30 degree digestion, this
sample should be digested in the incubator on the 120rpm shaker. Please fully
enclose the tube with parafilm and spray with ethanol before placing in the
incubator and shorten the digestion time to 30-40 minutes instead of 1 hr.
Please check the samples every 10 minutes and shorten digestion based on
observations to avoid over digestion.

  
  
  
  




After the 1 hour waterbath incubation:

Person: Michael Medynskyj  
Biopsy # 6  
  
Turn on centrifuge Remove frozen aliquot Stock dispase solution to thaw Remove
an aliquot of freshly prepared Stock Collagenase solution from -20ºC. Prepare
in hood: waste container/tube, 5mL serological pipettes

  
  
  
Fill each tube to 50 ml with cold WM. Gently invert a few times to mix.  
  
Centrifuge in a swinging bucket rotor at 500 x g for 5 min.     `18:21  -
18:26 pm  ``  
`  
  
Aspirate supernatant down to about 8 mL. CRITICAL STEP: The pellet at the
bottom after centrifugation is loose and can be easily disturbed. Control the
aspiration strength and always aspirate only from the surface of the
supernatant

  
  
Add 1 mL stock Collagenase II solution and 1 mL stock Dispase solution to the
tube.  
  
Resuspend the pellet with a 5-ml serological pipette. Triturate (pipette up &
down) 10-15 times or until the suspension travels up and down the pipette
smoothly without clogging.  
  
Seal the tube well with Parafilm and incubate in a 37°C water bath with
agitation (60-70 rpm on the recommended model of shaking water bath) for 30
min.       `18:44  -   19:14 pm  `` ``  ` Tubes should be positioned as
described in earlier.  
  
This protocol is normally performed with 60-70rpm agitation. Due to the fact
that the water bath shaker will be occupied by the 30 degree digestion, this
sample should be digested in the incubator on the 120rpm shaker. Please fully
enclose the tube with parafilm and spray with ethanol before placing in the
incubator and shorten the digestion time to 30-40 minutes instead of 1 hr.
Please check the samples every 10 minutes and shorten digestion based on
observations to avoid over digestion.  
  
  
  




After the 30 minute water bath incubation:

Person: Michael Medynskyj  
Biopsy # 6  
  
If the muscle is well digested, triturate through a 10mL serological pipette.

If there are still muscle chunks, `using a 10 mL syringe and 20-gauge needle,
aspirate and eject the muscle suspension in and out of the syringe 10 times.`

CRITICAL STEP: The needle may be clogged by small pieces of tendon or
undigested muscle during the first few attempts. If clogging occurs during
trituration, remove the clog from the tip of the needle. If clogging occurs
during ejection, pull the plunger up and down to move the clog out of
position. Eject towards the wall of the tube (as opposed to the bottom) to
avoid foaming.  
  
Fill tube to 50 ml with WM. Gently invert a few times to mix.  
  
Centrifuge at 500 x g for 5 min.      19`:24  -   19:29pm  `` ``  
`  
  
Aspirate supernatant down to about 10 mL.  
  
Place a 40-μm Nylon cell strainer on a fresh 50 mL conical tube.  
  
Resuspend the pellet with a 10 mL pipette. Transfer to the cell strainer and
allow to filter by gravity.  
  
Add 10 mL WM to the original tube. Swirl to rinse, and transfer to the same
cell strainer.  
  
Rinse the cell strainer with another 10 mL WM. Use a 20-200 μl pipet to
collect any remaining liquid on the underside of the strainer. CRITICAL STEP:
Make sure to collect everything that remains associated with the outside and
underside of the strainer after filtration to maximize yield.

  
  
  
Fill each tube to 50 mL with WM. Gently invert a few times to mix.  
  
Centrifuge at 500 x g for 5 min.         19`:53  -   19:58 pm  `` ``  
`  
  
Remove all supernatant by aspiration immediately after centrifugation as the
pellet will loosen over time! Be very careful not to aspirate cells from the
pellet!

  
  
  
  




Freezing isolates  
  
After isolation, please freeze 4 of the 5 samples as homogenate. The 5th
sample should be cultured.
