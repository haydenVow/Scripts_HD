Reagent preparation:

Use the following spreadsheet to:

  * Determine the total amount of regent required for primary staining
  * Provide more information on antibody types

OR

  

Alternatively plug in your values and manually calculate: (note these volumes
are for primary and secondary staining + DAPI)

PBST (0.2% Triton-X) : 4 x   16    (number of wells) x    140 uL  (volume per
well) =  ~9 mL  

Blocking buffer:  3 x    16   (number of wells) x    140ul   (volume per well)
=    ~7mL  

Note: blocking buffer is: PBST (0.2% Triton-X + PBS) + 3% bovine serum albumin
(BSA). Kept in the fridge until needed in blocking step

  

M- stim: Prepared Primary Antibody Mix: :  16  µL   Primary #1 MyoG (Santa

Blocking buffer: 13.2 mL

MyoG: 66 uL

MF20: 264 uL

  

Pipette-mixed antibody mix and stored refrigerated away from light until
needed.

Process:

Fixing ( ~ 1.20 - 2.30 hr)

  1. Prepare 0.1% PFA - 0.6mL of 4%PFA in 24mL of PBS  

  2. Removed media from each well and wash with 1000ul PBS.
    1. 11:22 - 11:29 am
    2. 11:36 - 11:42 am  

  3.  Added  1000 uL µL PFA for 1 - 2 hours  (1hr for small loops, 2hrs if the loop is >5mm in diameter) :  
    1. Small pieces:  11:48 - 1:26 pm
  4. Removed PFA (and add in PFA waste container) and wash wells 3 times with   500 µL of ice cold PBS

Small pieces

13:31 - 13:37 pm

13:38 - 13:43 pm

14:43 - 14:48 pm

  

Cut samples into size and place into a 48wp

  

INCLUDE DAY 7 PLATES IN THE NEXT STEPS

Permeabilise ( ~ 20 - 30 min)

1\. Removed PBS from each well.

2\. Added  140µL PBST (0.2% Triton-X) to each well for 15 min:  14:05 - 14:22
pm

3\. Aspirated PBST for each well.




Blocking ( ~ 1 hr)

1\. Added  500 µL of blocking buffer (3% BSA in PBST [0.1% Triton-X]) and
incubate for 45 minutes - 1hr at RT. (no more than 1 hour):   14:31 - 15:20 pm




Single/Simultaneous Primary Antibody staining ( ~ 10 minutes or 2hr)

1\. Removed blocking buffer from each well.

2\. Incubated cells with primary antibody for 90min - 2hrs at RT, or 4ºC
overnight:   15:32 pm

3\. Parafilmed plates and stored at 4ºC in tissue culture lab Fridge.

After this step, all further task should be performed in a dark room. The
vessel should also be wrapped foil when not used.
