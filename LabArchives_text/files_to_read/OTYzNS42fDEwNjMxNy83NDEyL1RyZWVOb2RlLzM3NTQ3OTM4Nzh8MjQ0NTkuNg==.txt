Equipment & Reagents
  
  
  1. 3 x empty non-treated 96-wps (output plates)
  2. 4 x DSD culture plates (input plates)
  3. 1 x 12-well OT2 reservoir 
  4. 1 x 200 uL OT2 pipette tip box
  5. Hoechst solution (50 ug/mL in MilliQ)
  6. Sytox green/Nuc green solution (1 drop/mL in dPBS)


Process

  1. Prepared 7 mL of Hoechst solution (50 ug/mL / 1:20 dilution of 1 mg/mL stock in MilliQ). Stored in light-safe tube until ready to use. 
  2. Prepared 25 mL of Sytox/Nuc Green solution (1 drop stock per 1 mL dPBS). Store in light-safe tube until ready to use.
  3. Started up "Fox" OT2 (Library Lab) and loaded protocol (attached below) 
  4. Set up deck as specified in protocol
    1. Notes:
      1. Tips to not have to be sterile for this protocol as the cells are endpoint
      2. Remove tips from rows 1 and 8 of tip racks before placing in deck - the top and bottom rows of the plates are just dPBS and do not need to be stained and this way you save tips and reagents being wasted. 
  5. Added Hoechst and Sytox to 12-well reservoir ("Media Vessel #1") as specified below:
    1.         A1 of Media Vessel #1 on 1 : Media 1 - Hoechst : 6000.00 uL
        A2 of Media Vessel #1 on 1 : Media 1 - Sytox : 12000.00 uL
        A3 of Media Vessel #1 on 1 : Media 1 - Sytox : 12000.00 uL

  6. Ran labwear offset calibration on OT2 
  7. Started protocol 
    1. Start time: 11:06:15
    2. 15-min pause: 
      1. START PAUSE: 00:20:06 (From the time the protocol started)
      2. STOP PAUSE: 00:35:06
    3. Run time: 39:51
  8. Once protocol was complete, removed plates and centrifuged for 1 min at 300 x g. 
  9. Imaged plates in order that they were stained (1, 2, 3 then 4) on main lab Zaber microscope (DAPI & AF488)
    1. Notes: 
      1. Please scan each plate ID before imaging and also include plate number when naming the folder and in the notes section to ensure we don't get the plate numbering wrong
      2. Keep plates in light-safe box while waiting to be imaged 
      3. Un-stained culture plates that remain in OT2 are then to be used for XTT assay (lab book link: https://au-mynotebook.labarchives.com/share/Vow%2520-%2520R&D/OTYzNi45fDEwNjMxNy83NDEzL1RyZWVOb2RlLzE2ODI5MDU5MDZ8MjQ0NjIuODk5OTk5OTk5OTk4)
  10. Shut down and cleaned OT2.
