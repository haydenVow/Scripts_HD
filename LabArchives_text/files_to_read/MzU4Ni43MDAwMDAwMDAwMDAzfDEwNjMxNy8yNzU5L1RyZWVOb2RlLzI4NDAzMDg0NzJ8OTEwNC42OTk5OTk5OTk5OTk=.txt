Results and analysis of key events:

During seeding

  * During seeding, the method than the control and cell containing gels were created vary slightly in that the components were added in different orders 
    * For the control, thrombin was added first with the cell free media, resulting in almost immediate clumping/gelling. As a result only two controls could be produced, and these were added to the wells at different volumes, having already formed a gel. 
    * For the cell containing, fibrinogen was added first into the cell suspension. During seeding, the cell suspension and fibrinogen mix pipetted into the wells began to gel before thrombin could be added to fully set the gel. 
  * Furthermore, samples gelled up almost immediately. Therefore it was difficult to evenly mix the gel and place a set and equal volume of the sample into the wells. This would have influence the amount of sample and cells present in each well.   

  

After seeding

  * During the first feed after seeding, the media was yellow in colour for cell containing samples. This is a result of the high seeding density.

  * 24 hours after seeding, the fibrin samples containing cells remained attached to the base of the well, which may have prevented the gels from contracting. 
  * The cell containing samples seeded on the conical insert contracted and around the staff/ pole in the center, forming a ring. 

  

  * Upon examination under phase microscopy, it was evident which samples contained cells, and which didn't. The cell containing had small round bubble like surface on and within the entire gel, whilst the control appeared semi- transparent with dark spots spread across the gel (like a think flexible membrane). 

No insert with cells

  



CMFDA stain

  * 24 hours after seeding, a non insert cell containing sample was sacrificed for staining with CMFDA. The stain showed that there was cells still alive and embedded within the gel matrix.

  * After 2 days in E6 media, CMFDA stain on cell containing non - insert fibrin sample showed that there were still live cells. Furthermore, the cells in embedded in fibrin appear elongated, suggesting that differentiation has taken place.

MyoG, MF20, DAPI stain

  * The images obtained from the fluorescent stains for MF20 and MyoG were difficult to see. Due to the transparent nature of the gel, there is a lot of background exposure from the unfocused cells that were stained. Therefore the images may appear to have large blurry bright spots with not well defined individual cells.  

  

Day 6 stain  (9th and 10th)

  * At day 6, the images for all the cell containing fibrin samples showed that there was many cells still present in the gel, evident through the DAPI stain. 
  * All samples containing cells also has a small amount MyoG, however the signal is considerable low and upon merging with the other images (Dapi and MF20), the signal can barley be seen. 
  * The most notable signal for MF20 in the fibrin sample came from the sample in the conical insert. This may suggest that the conical insert is performing better compared to the other.

Day 14 stain (17th)

  * For cell containing samples, all the images show cells present in the gel as indicated through DAPI fluorescent. For MyoG and MF20 it is a bit more difficult to conclude as the gel itself is visible. On some images such as the no insert samples, a small amount of MF20 is visible, however upon merging the image, the gel being of similar brightness creates a "cloud" of MF20.

Cell containing, no insert sample - MF20, DAPI

  * It would appear that the cells have differentiated based on the MyoG stain and have matured in some parts based on the presence of the MF20 stain.
