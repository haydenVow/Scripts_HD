Prepare plates

  1. Add 50 uL/well of fresh Growth Medium  
Plate 1: RPMI + 20% FBS + 1X P/S + 10 ng/mL FGF  
Plate 2: RPMI + 20% FBS + 1X P/S + ACA (1:100) + o.1% pluronic + 10 ng/mL FGF

  2. Parafilm plates before closing the lid (sterile-side down, facing wells, as demonstrated in image below) & then parafilm lids and plates together (same fashion as is done for fix and stained plates in fridge) for transport to Garvan : 12:30

  




Prepare FACS buffer

  1. Prepare 20mL of FACS buffer (PRF DMEM/F12 + 2% FBS).
    1. 400uL FBS + 19.6mL PRF DMEM/F12
  2. Sterile filter through a 0.2 µm filter.
  3. Store at 4ºC until needed. 10:50




Prepare cells for FACS by following relevant harvesting protocol (lab book:

  2. Once cell pellet was generated after neutralising:
    1. Re-suspended pellet in _3_ mL Growth Medium (can go up to 4 - 5mL if necessary, just keep in mind Hoechst is 100 X so if cell suspension is 5 mL, add 50 uL of Hoechst in the next step, etc.)
    2. Placed the FACS tube cell suspension on ice. : 12:36

  




Prepare 1 styrofoam boxes to transfer to the Garvan

1 Box with:

  * Pre-filled (medium) multi-well plates, parafilmed
  * An ice pack
  * Hoechst (ddH20) - vial is located in large new fridge in library lab, top shelf of door in 70 mL urine conatiner 
  * Extra FACS Buffer
  * Tube containing cells
