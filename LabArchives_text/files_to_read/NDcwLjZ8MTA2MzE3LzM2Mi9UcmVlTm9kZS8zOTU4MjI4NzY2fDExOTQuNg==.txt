Process:

  1. Removed plate(s) `culture IDs:`   6393     
  2. Removed media from N=3  wells of the 6 well plate.
  3. Washed wells 3 times in  2mL of PBS for  `5`  minutes at room temperature.
    1. `10:39-10:44`
    2. ` 10:45-10:50`
    3. `10:51-10:56`
  4. Added    1mL of 2% PFA to each scaffold and incubate for  `15`  min at room temperature.  `11:00 - 11:15`
  5. Washed pieces 2 x more for   `5`    minutes in PBS at room temperature.`11:17 - 11:22 and 11:23-11:28  
`

  6. Aspirate the PBS and leave the scaffold pieces just covered by fresh PBS.
  7. `label the plate halves with the respective culture IDs and date of fixing and/or staining`

Janus Green staining

sources: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10542111/

\--> cells are fixed in ethanol and stained with a 0.2% solution of Janus
green for 3 min, followed by a destaining step of 1 min in tap water. The
addition of diluted hydrochloric acid easily and immediately leads to dye
elution from stained cell layers into the acidic supernatant which
consequently is transferred into 96-well plates and read on a microplate
reader at 595 nm.

Reagents:

  1. Janus Green 0.3% solution in PBS: Mix ID4399
  2. 0.5M HCl: Mix ID4400

Protocol:

  1. Remove any media from the plate containing the adherent cells/scaffolds. 
  2. Add 1X Janus Green Stain (0.3% solution in PBS) per well, sufficient to cover the cells/scaffold = 1 mL in 6-well plate. 
    1. Start 11:33
  3. Incubate for 5 min at room temperature.
  4. Remove dye, wash 5 times in deionized water (3 mL each wash) or until excess dye is removed.
  5. Remove last water wash, blot to dry, add 0.5 M HCl (sufficient volume to cover the cells/scaffolds) and incubate for 10 min.
  6. Remove the scaffolds from the 96wps, leaving the stained HCL behind.
