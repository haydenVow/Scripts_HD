Process

  1. Collected mini bioreactor tubes from shaker, wiped with ethanol-sprayed Rediwipe, and brought into BSC 
  2. Pipetted up and down with P1000 to ensure even distribution of cells
  3. Took 10 uL samples from each culture and transferred to separate small tubes for manual cell counting. 
  4. Returned the bioreactor tubes to the incubator while proceeding with the manual cell count. 
  5. Once cell count was completed, removed bioreactor tubes from the shaker once more before proceeding with the feeding protocol below for each tube 
    1. centrifuged 5 mins 110g
    2. carefully removed supernatant (the pellet was less formed so I was careful not to disrupt it)
    3. resuspended in 3 mL hycellcho + KSR + IGF1-LR3 + FGF-b media
    4. Passed through cell strainer into new shaker tube. 
    5. added 2 mL more media to previous shaker tube and wash out any remaining cells
    6. Passed through the cell strainer into new shaker tube
    7. Placed mini bio reactor tubes to incubator

Staining

  

Counting

Manually count using trypan blue

  1. Add 10 ul trypan blue to each sample to achieve a 1 in 2 dilution
  2. count via haemocytometer
