MTT STAINING PROTOCOL

Reagent Preparation (Example dilution is 75 mg MTT in 15 mL Diluent - so 5mg
of MTT per mL)

DMEM16246 ml  
  
  
 Protocol:

  1. Aliquotted 6 ml of DMEM media and placed in water bath , 11:48
  2.  Retrieve N = 1 alginate from bioreactor and N = 1 alginate from the 6 well plate and N = 1 cell seeded zein from the 24 well plate
  3. Weighed out 30 mg of MTT (Stock #884) into a falcon tube then add  6 ml of the pre-warmed DMEM.  
  4. Pipetted up and down until re-suspended. Yellow colour should form. Cover tube with foil.
  5. Removed the vessels containing the alginate samples from the incubator
  6. Using a sterile spatula, transferred samples to new wells of a 24-well plate
  7. Covered each sample with 1.5 ml per well of the MTT DMEM PRF media. 
  8. Protected the plate from light using foil and placed in the incubator for 1h (37ÂºC, 5% CO2). 12:20
  9. Replaced media with PBS for better visibility of the sample colour.
  10. Took pictures of the samples in the MTT plate using a phone/camera and attach below.  13:20
  11. Imaged samples down the microscope (phase), 3 images per sample. Upload images below. 13:30-14:00

Note - purple coloration indicates live cells - samples which remain yellow
suggest no cells or dead cells

General observations:

All samples showed a black stain with good cell coverage. More cell coverage
on one side of the zein than the other.

### Process:

  1. Removed flask(s)/plate(s) `culture IDs:` 6440-DOLLY12-Sheep P12-1of2 (24w plate),  
6441-DOLLY12-Sheep P12-2of2 (reactor, 300 mL), 6453-DOLLY12-Sheep P12-3of3 (6w
plate) containing scaffolds from the incubator.

  2. Used sterile tweezers to carefully transfer   `17`  scaffold pieces to separate wells on a 96 well plate.

  3. Washed the pieces on the 24 well plate 2 times in 230 ul of PBS for  `5`  minutes at room temperature.

    1. `14:34 - 14:39`
    2. `14:40 - 14:45`
  4. Added   230 uL of 4% PFA to each scaffold and incubate for  `15`  min at room temperature.  `14:57 - 15:02`

  5. Washed pieces once more for   `5`    minutes in PBS at room temperature.  `15:04 - 15:09`  
  
Realised PFA needs 15 min not 5 min incubation.  
Added 4% PFA again for an additional 10 mins 15:21 - 15:31  
  
Rewashed with PBS 15:31 - 15:36  
  

  6. Aspirate PBS and stain the pieces with 200 uL of DAPI in PBS (1:1000) (17 x 200 ul = 3400 ul -> 3.4 ul of DAPI required)  
  
for 5 minutes in the dark. `15:39 - 15:44  
`

  7. Wash the pieces 2 times for   5   `minutes in` 200 ul of PBS.

    1. `15:48 - 15:53`
    2. `15:53 - 15:58`
  8. Aspirate the PBS and leave the scaffold pieces just covered by fresh PBS. 16:00

`label the plate halves with the respective culture IDs and date of fixing
and/or staining`

  

Placed in the biomaterials fridge. 16:02  

  




Maturation Bioreactor Additional Observations

\- Media Colour: Normal

\- Bioreactor Lid: Residue present after autoclaving. Possibly oxidation of
the metal.

\- Tray Insert: No visible defects colouring or residues.

\- Bioreactor Base: Deposits present on the bottom of the base. Organic
material present which looks like zein that may have stuck to the metal.
Beneath the organic deposit the coating on the base has come away to reveal
the bare metal beneath the coating, which appears black in the photos compared
to the silver coating.
