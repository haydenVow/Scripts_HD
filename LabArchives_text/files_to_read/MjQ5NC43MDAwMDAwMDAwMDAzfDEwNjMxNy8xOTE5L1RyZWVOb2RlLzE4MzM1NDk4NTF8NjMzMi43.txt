Growth Media:

  * [x]  DMEM/F12 + 20% FBS + 1X P/S + P38i (10uM)




### Process:

1\. Took image of vessel with microscope on phase setting.

3\. Aliquotted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then
placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath for a minimum of 20 minutes
prior to use:

  1. TrypLE:     40    mL in    50 mL     tubes
  2.  dPBS (for washing and neutralising):    40     mL in    40    tubes
  3. Growth media (for pellet resuspension):     15    mL in     15    tubes
  4. Growth media (for seeding):      27 mL + 4 mL + 12 mL   mL in     seperate 15 mL and 50 mL    tube

Time that all aliquots were placed in the water bath the warm before use
11:47  am

Note: if aliquots were placed in water bath at different time, record the time
stamp for each individual solution.




4\. Removed vessel(s) from the incubator     13:04 pm

5\. Washed the vessel(s) with dPBS (warmed).

6\. Added      10   mL tryple to each vessel/well and incubated at 37˚C.

  1. Start/Finish for TrypLE was     13:13 - 13:28  pm 

7\. Neutralised with     10 mL     dPBS and combined cell suspension into a
2 X 50 ML    tube.

8\. Centrifuged at 650 x g for 5 min.

  1. Start/Finish time for centrifugation was     13:40 - 13:45  Pm 




9\. Aspirated the supernatant(s).

10\. Resuspended pellet(s) in     12    mL    GROWTH      media     13:58   pm

11\. Aliquoted      200 uL    of resuspended cells into a microcentrifuge tube
for cell count.

12\. Performed a cell count using the haemocytometer and recorded the cell
count data in the Google Doc spreadsheet called 'Cell Count Spreadsheet' (see
link below):

SSIBtIylyrBQE5kRX5Z8NtI/edit#gid=0

  1.  Total cell number was:     6,546,400 cells        

  2. Cells required for experiments
    1. Lily: 8 x scaffolds + 8 x adherent  \- 5.6M (0.7M per well) for scaffold and 56000 (7K per well) for adherent https://au-mynotebook.labarchives.com/share/Vow%2520-%2520Team%2520Science/MjE1NS40fDEwNjMxNy8xNjU4L1RyZWVOb2RlLzExNTAxMTEwNzF8NTQ3MS40
    2. Kylie: 2 x 96 wp - 827400 cells. (density of 4310 cells/cm2)
    3. Chris: 3 x 60mm plates - 63000 cells. (density of 1000cells/cm2)
  3. Volume of cell suspension required for subculture was:  
    1. Lily       8.38323 mL +  0.08383 mL     

    2. Kylie     1.23862 mL      

    3. Chris     0.09431 mL   

  




13\. Transferred    cell suspension to the pre-warmed   Growth media:  

14\. Transferred cell suspension into vessel.

15\. Left at RT in the BSC for 30 min to allow cells to settle      14:30  \-
15:00 pm  

16\. Transferred vessel(s) to incubate at:

  * [x]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (avian cells)

Version Change Log

NameChange Details  
V1 (original)N/A  
V2Changed all sentences to past tense to better reflect a hand-written lab
book entry.
