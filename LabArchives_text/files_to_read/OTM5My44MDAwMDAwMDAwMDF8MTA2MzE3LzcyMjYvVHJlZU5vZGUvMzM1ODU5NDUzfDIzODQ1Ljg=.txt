3\. Place aliquots in pre-warmed water bath and leave for ~20 minutes or until
warmed.

4\. Transfer aliquots and flasks required for passage into the BSC.

5\. Centrifuge the cells at 310 x g for 10 mins

6\. Aspirate 100% of the supernatant and resuspended the cells in fresh growth
medium

7\. Transfer the flasks into the 37'C incubator on a shaker platform at the
required RPM.
