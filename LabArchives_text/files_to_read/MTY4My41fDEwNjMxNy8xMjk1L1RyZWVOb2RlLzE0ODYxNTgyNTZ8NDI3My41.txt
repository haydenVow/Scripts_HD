Moved the sterile bioreactor vessel and bottles from the autoclave to near a
BSC

  1. Waited for the autoclaving chamber to cool to 60-70 deg C
  2. Opened the chamber and checked connections to make sure that all vessels remained sealed. In the event that any tubing popped off, rinsed the connections with 70% ethanol and reconnected; or, re-autoclaved the entire assembly.
  3. Placed the vessel and bottles on a trolley and moved the trolley next to a BSC.

 ~~ ~~Prepared base solution bottle:~~~~

  1.  ~~Sterile filtered 1 mol/L sodium hydroxide solution~~
  2.  ~~Transferred the solution to the pre-autoclaved "base" bottle~~

Base solution was previously autoclaved with the bioreactor.

Prepared growth medium:

  1. Sterile filtered 400 mL of DMEM, 400 mL of F12, 200 mL of FBS and 10 mL of P/S into a 1 L bottle.
  2. Repeated step 1.

 ~~Prepared microcarrier bottle:~~

  1.  ~~Aspirated and discarded supernatant from microcarriers.~~
  2.  ~~Resuspended microcarriers in growth medium.~~
  3.  ~~Waited for 2 minutes until microcarriers settled.~~
  4.  ~~Aspirated and discarded supernatant from microcarriers.~~
  5.  ~~Resuspended microcarriers to in fresh growth medium to a volume of 600 mL.~~
  6.  ~~Transferred suspension to the addition/harvest bottle.~~

Microcarriers were previously hydrated and sterilized in the bioreactor.

Prepared feed bottle:

  1. Transferred the remaining fresh medium to the feed bottle.

Prepared seed bottle:

  1. Resuspended cells in 50 mL of fresh growth medium.

NotesO rings on autoclaved schott bottles may be sticky, When fixing the
autoclaved bioreactor lids to the schott bottle ensure lid detaches easily.
otherwise transfer the contents of your innoculum to the autoclaved schott
bottle.  
  
  
  




Connected the liquid addition bottles to the bioreactor vessel

  1. Thoroughly wiped down the female STT connectors attached to the tubes that are attached to the bioreactor vessel.
  2. Placed the female STT connectors in the BSC.
  3. Removed the cap from a female STT connector with two hands
  4. While still holding the female STT connector in one hand, removed the cap from the male STT connector with one hand and connected the male and female parts together.
  5. Ensured that the correct male and female parts were connected.
  6. Unclamped all of the lines after everything was connected.
  7. Repeated the previous steps for all female/male STT connector pairs EXCEPT for the seed bottle.
  8. Removed the bottles from the BSC and placed on the trolley with the bioreactor vessel.
  9. Transferred the bottles and vessel to the bench next to the control tower.

these for later use.  
  
  
  
  




Added the culture medium & microcarriers

  1. Fitted the stirrer motor
  2. Turned the stirrer on to 180 RPM
  3. Fitted pump A to pump OUT of the line connected to the harvest dip tube.
  4. Clamped the harvest bottle line and unclamped the waste bottle line.
  5. Pumped out the waste liquid until bubbles emerged from the dip tube inside the waste bottle.
  6. Stopped the stirrer motor once the level dipped below the impeller.
  7. Stopped the pump once the visible supernatant had been aspirated from the microcarrier layer.
  8. Clamped the waste bottle line.
  9. Unclamped the feed bottle line and fitted into the SUBS-A pump head
  10. Turned on the pump and added 500 mL of growth medium to the microcarriers.
  11. Turned on the stirrer to 180 RPM.
  12. The medium addition via the headport generated  a ~30 mm layer of foam (as the droplets fell to the bottom and hit the surface), so waited until the foam dissipated.
  13. After 15 minutes, pumped out the 500 mL of supernatant to waste.
  14. Pumped in 600 mL of fresh growth medium until bubbles emerged from the harvest pipe inside the bioreactor vessel.
  15. Ensured that there was enough growth medium to completely submerge the impeller, sparger and probes, and enough to reach the bottom of the sample dip tube.
  16. Clamped the microcarrier/harvest bottle line
  17. Reversed pump A again to pump OUT of the line connected to the harvest dip tube.

    Fitted the liquid addition/removal lines into the peristaltic pumps

  1. Opened the peristaltic pump heads.
  2. Placed the tubing from each bottle in the respective persitaltic pump head.
  3. Ensured that the tubing was the correct way round as the pumps turn only in one direction.
  4. Closed the pump heads.
  5. Placed the feed bottle in the bar fridge under the bioreactor bench.

NotesAnti-foam and base lines should always go to anti-foam and base pump
respectively because they are automatically controlled.  
  
  
  




Primed the feed tubes

  1. Ran each persitaltic pump from the Biostat control software to fill the liquid addition tubes.
  2. Set the totaliser to 0 after priming all tubes.
    1. Priming the tubes and the setting the totalizer to 0 ensures that the control unit will record the correct volume of liquid during the run.

Fitted and connected the heating blanket

  1. Fitted the heating blanket around the lower portion of the glass vessel (tough side touching the glass and soft spongy side facing out).
  2. Ensured that the heating blanket was connected to the control tower.

Fitted and connected the exhaust heater

  1. Stretched the flaps of the heater over the exhaust filter (so that the filter is "sandwiched" between the tough flaps).
  2. Ensured that the heater was connected to the control tower.

Turned on the gas supply to the control tower

  1. Pulled the regulator cap up until it "pops" and a yellow ring shows.
  2. Turned the cap in the direction indicated to increase the output pressure to 1 Bar (100 kPa or 15 PSI).
  3. Pushed the regulator cap back down to lock it in place.
  4. Repeated for each gas type.
