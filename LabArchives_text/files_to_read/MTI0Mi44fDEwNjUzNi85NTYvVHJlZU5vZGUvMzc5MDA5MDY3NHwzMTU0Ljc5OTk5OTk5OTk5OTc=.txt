Passage 2 - 1x E125 into 1x E250


# Procedure - Passage

###

1\. Turn on water bath and set temperature to 37'C.

2\. Aliquot required volume of Growth Media in sterile tubes/pots. Refer to
Tables below for required volume.

Vessel Type (Harvested)Vessel Type (Seeded)Volume required to dilute culture  
E125E25030 mL  
E500  
150 mL  
  
E250 E500120 mL  
E500E2000520 mL  
100% Growth Media Feed  
  
Flask Type

Volume of Media Required per flask (mL)

RPM speed  
E12530125  
E25060125  
E500180125  
E2000700  
100  
  
3\. Place aliquots in pre-warmed water bath and leave for ~20 minutes or until
warmed.

4\. Transfer aliquots and flasks required for passage into the BSC.

5\. Transfer entire culture volume into a appropriate vessel for
centrifugation i.e., 50 mL falcon tube

6\. Aspirate the supernatant and resuspend cell pellet with 10 mL fresh growth
media

7\. Retrieve a 100 uL sample from each culture

8\. Perform a cell count to obtain cell numbers

9\. Top up with required amount of growth media to seed a larger vessel(s),
i.e.,m add 50 mL to the 10 mL cell resuspension to seed a E250 flask. See
second table above

10\. Once cells have been re-suspended in the total growth media transfer the
growth media + cells into each flask(s)

11\. Transfer the flasks into the 37'C incubator on a shaker platform at the
required RPM.
