ACF media iteration:  E8_10C

Volume of media to make:

  * 3 L




## Process

  

  1. Prepared 2M solution of GABA by adding 1.0312g in 5 mL PBS.
  2. Prepared 100mM glyoxylic acid solution by adding 0.092g in 10mL DMEM/F12.
  3. Prepared 2M hypoxanthine solution by adding 1.3611g in 5mL of DMEM/F12.
  4. Added 1.469.5 mL of F12 and 969.5 mL of DMEM to an autoclaved carboy.
  5. Opened a 500mL bottle of DMEM so that we could pipette ingredients into it.
  6. Added all the ingredients needed for 3L of E8 media into DMEM bottle following E8 calculator spreadsheet.
    1.   7. Added the amount of albumin, trace elements B, hLIF, hEGF, and p38i as indicated in the E8_9C Media Calculatorspreadsheet.
    1.   8. Added 10.5 uL ethanolamine stock (as opposed to diluting the stock as indicated in the spreadsheet).
  9. Added 60uL of 2M GABA stock (used a more concentrated stock compared to spreadsheet).
  10. Added 1mL of 2M hypoxanthine solution (used a more concentrated stock compared to spreadsheet).
  11. Added 1.5 mL of 100mM glyoxylic acid to make E810C.
  12. Added the 500mL DMEM bottled containing all the ingredients into the carboy.
  13. Sterile filtered medium.
  14. Aliquoted into 5 aliquots of 600 mL.
  15. Added 6mL of lipids to each aliquot.
  16. Wrapped bottle with foil to protect from light  
  17. Labelled and stored in fridge
