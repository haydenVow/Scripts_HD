Process
  
  
*Note: Flasks have been labelled with numbers 1-36, where #1 refers to flask ID 12686 and #36 refers to flask ID 12721, in order to make the labelling of ViCell tubes quicker.

         Inside the BSC

  1. Labelled 36 x 1.5 mL eppendorf tubes with numbers 1-36, 1 referring to flask ID 12686 and 36 to flask ID 12721.
  2. Took 1 x ~~750uL~~ (LL: took 760 uL to ensure we could get a full 500 uL aliquot for biochem analysis) aliquot from each E125 into 1 x 1.5mL eppendorf tube each.  
  
Outside the BSC  
  

  3. Took 500uL per 1.5mL eppendorf tube deposited in Vicell Tube, having a total of 36 x ViCell tubes. 
  4. Performed counts on ViCell and recorded counts in media results G-sheet.
  5. While counts are being performed, diluted remaining 250uL in each eppendorf tube with an equal volume of MiliQ water (250uL).
  6. Quick-spun for 1 minute, using the bento lab or microcentrifuge.
  7. Printed labels 12686-12721 (ask Sean to perform this task so that each label doesn't have to be printed individually). Cut the labels so that ID and EPIC number was visible and stuck labels onto 36 x new 1.5 mL eppendorf tubes.  
  8. After centrifugation, aspirated supernatant from the 36 x 1.5mL tubes and deposited into new labelled tube. Discarded pellet.
  9. Placed in the -20'C freezer in Main Lab (#184) in a plastic box labeled "Biochem analyses for BIF'.
  10. Enter the details of your samples in this G-sheet. Please try to ensure the order of the samples in the box match the order in the spreadsheet.
