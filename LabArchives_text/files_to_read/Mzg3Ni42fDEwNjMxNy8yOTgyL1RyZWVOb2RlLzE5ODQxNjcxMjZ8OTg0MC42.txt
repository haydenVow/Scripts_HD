Preparation of media conditions:

*All conditions, except for the serum control, will be in the same standard growth media which will be DMEM/F12 + 2% FBS + 1X P/S. The only difference will be the HDAC and/or hydrolysate supplementation added. 

Prep of both hydrolysate stock solutions:

Before adding the hydrolysates into the media they will first have to be
prepared as a stock solution. To make it easier in determining how much of the
stock solution needs to added to the growth media its best to prepare a stock
solution of 10% (w/v) (i.e. 100g of hydrolysate in 1 L of Milli-Q water).
Fortunately, if 1 L of solution is not required the volume can be easily
adjusted.

1\. Retrieve hydrolysates from the cell expansion fridge - BBL Phytone Peptone
Stock #372 and Difco Select Phytone UF Stock #3489. 12:30

2\. Weigh out ~~0.5  ~~10 g of each hydrolysate.

3\. Add the ~~0.5~~ 10 g powder to ~~5~~ 100 mL of Milli-Q water. According to
this technical sheet the hydrolysates should be soluble in purified water and
the solution should appear to be clear to slightly hazy.

4\. Sterile filtered the dissolved hydrolysate solution through a 0.22 um
filter unit in the LIBRARY LAB. This concentrate can then be used to add the
hydrolysates into the growth media. NOTE: BBL Phytone Peptone solution passed
through filter very slowly, clogging twice and requiring 2x fresh filters to
sterilize entire 100 mL volume. Would recommend testing autoclaving next time.

5\. Store solution at 4'C for 2-4 weeks.  

Please make sure that whenever media containing hydrolysates is required, that
it is prepared on or as close to the day its required as possible. In order to
make media with hydrolysates at 5g/L just add 0.05 mL (50 uL) of the
hydrolysate concentrate to 3 mL of growth media.

Thaw HDACs and transfer to GM:

  1. Remove vials from the -80 deg C freezer
  2. Thaw at room temperature with periodic gentle agitation
  3. Centrifuge to recover as much of the solution as possible
  4. Remove as much of the solution as required and return remainder to -80 deg C freezer
    1. HDAC1 570 ug/mL, 50 ug = 87 uL (150 mL of HDAC1 in GM at 0.2 ug/mL -> 53 uL of stock solution into 150 mL of GM)
    2. HDAC2 2730 ug/mL, 50 ug = 18 uL (150 mL of HDAC2 in GM at 0.2 ug/mL -> 11 uL of stock solution into 150 mL of GM)

  * Growth media (for seeding) 6-well plates:   2.4 mL  (for each condition in plate maps - 8 in total) 
  * Growth media (for seeding) E125 flasks:  24  mL  (for each condition in plate maps - 3 in total) 
  * Growth media 2% FBS: 23 mL for cell resuspension

thawed vial ID has a passage number of 3, when you make a culture ID for you
vessel you will need change the passage number to 4 on Airtable.)
