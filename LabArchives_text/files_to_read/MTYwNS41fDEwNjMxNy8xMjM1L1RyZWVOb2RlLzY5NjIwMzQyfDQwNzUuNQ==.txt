Process:

1\. Aliquotted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then
placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath for a minimum of 20 minutes
prior to use:

  1. TrypLE:    140   mL in   1x 250 mL    pot
  2. dPBS (for washing)   140   mL in   1x 250 mL   pot
  3. Times that all aliquots were placed in the water bath to warm before use   17:20

Note: if aliquots were placed in water bath at different times, record the
time stamp for each individual solution.




2\. Added    10 (T175) / 100 (2CF)   mL tryple to each vessel/well and
incubated at 37ËšC for    10    min.

3\. Weigh empty falcon tubes prior to adding cell suspension

  1. Tube 1: 12.522 g
  2. Tube 2: 12.566 g

4\. Aspirate cell suspension and fibroblast sheets/cells

5\. Centrifuged at 650 x g for 5 min

  1. Start/Finish time for centrifugation was  18:10  \-  18:20   




6\. Aspirated the supernatant(s)

7\. Weigh falcon tubes containing fibroblast cells

  1. Tube 1: 13.673 g
  2. Tube 2: 12.882 g

Weight of pellets:

  1. Tube 1: 1.151 g
  2. Tube 2: 0.316 g

Total weight of pellet: 1.467 g
