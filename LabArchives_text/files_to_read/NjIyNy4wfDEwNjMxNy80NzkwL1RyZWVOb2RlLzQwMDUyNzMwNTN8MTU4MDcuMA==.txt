CultureBiosciences (CB) is primarily a ""parallel bioreactors as a service"
company. They have a platform of hundreds of 250 mL bioreactors. Customers can
book time on these bioreactors, which are operated by a combination skilled
staff and automation. Customers design an experiment and request a certain
number of bioreactors for a certain amount of time, then provide CB with the
information (e.g. temperature, pH, stirring speed) and materials (cells,
proprietary media formulations) required to run the bioreactors.
