Perform feed using below volumes:

  




Differentiation Media:

  * E6  
  
Total media required: 48 mL




Culture IDs to feed

Vessel type(s)Vessel ID  
12 well plate  
7450-DOLLY12-Sheep P10-1of2  
7451-DOLLY12-Sheep P10-2of2  
  
  
  




Process:

1\. Aliquotted  1x 48 mL  mL of  E6 Dif Media into  1x 50mL  tube(s). Labelled
aliquots with the feed date and 'EPIC21489'.  
Placed aliquots in media fridge 74 in main lab 15:00 26/07

2\. Aliquots placed in water bath   10:30  

2\. Removed  100% of supernatant from vessel.

3\. Replaced with  2mL (per well/per vessel) of  E6 Dif  media.

4\. Returned vessel to incubate at:   11:20  

  * [x]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (aviary cells)

  

  * [x]  Thermo Incubator (ID #13)
  * [ ]  Top Sanyo Incubator (ID #25)
  * [ ]  Bottom Sanyo Incubator
  * [ ]  Top Binder Incubator
  * [ ]  Bottom Binder Incubator\

5\. Two electrode plates were sprayed down with ethanol and UV sterilised
inside the BSC under the portable UV lamp for a minimum of 1 hour 16:20 -
18:20

6\. Two channels were connected to each electrode plate, with one channel
running down column 1 and the other running down column 2.

  

Due to errors with the EStim setup, the cells were exposed to a series of test
signals and just left with the electrodes in place but no signal being run
overnight.
