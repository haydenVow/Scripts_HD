Update and outcome


Experiment discard reasons:

Data from Experiment 1 suggests that optimum cell density for formation of
mini-tissues using Nuvonis cells is 15 million cells per mL or above. This
experiment was seeded at 5million cells per mL, as such, tissues were formed
sub-optimally and were discarded.

Discard procedure:

  1. Aspirate waste media into waste pot
  2. Bleach entire plates with tissues to biologically inactivate tissues for 1 hour
  3. Remove tissues from wells with forceps
  4. Place entire plates in detergent overnight
  5. Wash with tap water to remove detergent
  6. Wash with MilliQ water
  7. Place in Ethanol overnight
