Background

We have recently had difficulty performing cell counts on suspension cultures
stained with trypan blue. This is due to a high amount of debris present, as
well as due to an apparent change in cell morphology in suspension cultures.
We have not been able to differentiate between live and dead cells as well as
between cells and debris.. This has compromised the accuracy of our count data
as it is highly open to interpretation and counts are likely to vary depending
on the user.

Initially, a combination of Hoechst and Propidium Iodide (PI) staining will be
trialled.  Hoechst 33342 staining is tool commonly used at Vow to quantify
cell numbers, particularly on microcarriers. Hoechst is excited by ultraviolet
light at 350nm and is a cell permeable stain that binds to the minor grove of
DNA in both live and dead cells, it can therefore be used to determine total
cell count. PI is also a DNA stain however is is excluded by intact cell
membranes, making it permeable only to dead cells. Staining samples with both
Hoechst and PI should allow us to determine our total cell, live and dead cell
counts. Staining with automated cell counting by MIA or ImageJ should also
remove any human subjectivity or user bias between counts.  
  
In future, we may also look to assess staining of live cells using Calcein or
or Cell Tracker.
