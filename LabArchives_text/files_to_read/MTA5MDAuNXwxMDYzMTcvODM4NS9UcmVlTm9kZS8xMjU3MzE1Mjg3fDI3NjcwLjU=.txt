### Process:

  

  

1\. Fillled two 96 well plates with 300uL of dPBS and 200uL of tryple as per
the plate guide above (ignored position 4). Filled another separate plate with
growth media (DMEM/F12+ 20% FBS + 1xP/S), 200uL per well.  

2\. Generated a multiwell open protocol using the 'Dynamo' script using the 1
well passaging protocol attached and the pick lists generated on the 8/6/22

3\. Set up the opentron deck as per the layout at the top of the page using
cultures 12389 and 12492 and ran the generated multiwell protocol (see
attached).

6\. Allowed the protocol to run to completion. (tryple time per well was 20
minutes, with tryple prewarmed to 37 degrees  using deck heaters before it was
added to cells.

7\. Transferred the new culture to incubate at 30 degrees, 5% CO2 incubator
#140.
