Experimental Plan:

  

  

  




96-well-plates

DAY 0: Seed 4 x 96 well plates with 2240 cells/well in 140 uL/well:

  1. Thaw 1 WCB of F-DOLLY12 and seed 4x96 well-plates with the required number of condition columns (6 wells per column, as seen above):
  2. Label 4x96 well plates as a designated time point: 24h (1), 48h (2), 72h (3), and 96h (4).
  3. Place plates in the incubator at 37'C, 5% CO2. 

Note: place 140uL dPBS in every well around the outside of the plate, as seen
in the example well-plate above.

Day 1: 24 hours later, fix and DAPI stain one plate. On the remaining 3
plates, do a 50% Feed.  

  1. Following completion of the fix and DAPI protocol, use the Zaber to image all of the DAPI stained wells.
  2. For storage and in case of later analysis, use parafilm to seal the plate. Then cover the plate in foil (labelled) and place in the fridge.

Note: Detailed instructions for fix and DAPI stain are found on the
corresponding data pages

Day 2: Fix and DAPI stain 48h plate and image with Zaber using MIA capture

  1. Repeat instruction from previous day on plate (2)

Day 3: Fix and DAPI stain 72h plate and image with Zaber using MIA capture

  1. Repeat instruction from previous day on plate (3)

Day 4: Fix and DAPI stain 96h plate and image with Zaber using MIA capture

  1. Repeat instruction from previous day on plate (4)

  

Continuous Culture in T-Flasks

* A minimum of 1 flask must be used for this culture but more can be used if desired/required  

DAY 0: Seed at least 1 Flask at 7,500cells/cm2

  1. After seeding the 4 x 96-well-plates, use the remaining cells to seed at least 1 x Flask @ 7,500cells/cm2 in the new batch of In-House media
  2. Label the flasks and place them in an incubator at 37'C, 5% CO2.

Day 1: 50% Feed

Day 4: P2 (move cells into a new flask/s)

  1. Harvest the cells from the previous flask/s and seed them into a new flask/s at a seeding density of 7,500cells/cm2
  2. Label the flask/s and place them in an incubator at 37'C, 5% CO2.

Day 7: 50% Feed

Day 9: P3 (move cells into a new flask/s)

  1. Harvest the cells from the previous flask/s and seed them into a new flask/s at a seeding density of 7,500cells/cm2
  2. Label the flask/s and place them in an incubator at 37'C, 5% CO2.

Day 14: 50% Feed

Day 15: P4 (move cells into a new flask/s)

  1. Harvest the cells from the previous flask/s and seed them into a new flask/s at a seeding density of 7,500cells/cm2
  2. Label the flask/s and place them in an incubator at 37'C, 5% CO2.

Day 18: 50% Feed

Day 21: Harvest

  1. Harvest the cells from the flask/s
