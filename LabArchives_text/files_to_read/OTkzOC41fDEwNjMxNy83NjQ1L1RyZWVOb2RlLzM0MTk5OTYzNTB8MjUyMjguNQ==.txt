Aim/Purpose


The aim for this experiment is to perform large scale ("3x scaled up" \- Well
volume of 4mL) tissue engineering with primary Water Buffalo (BUFFY)
myoblasts, to generate on the order of 25-50 grams worth of tissue-engineered
muscle.

The details for literature search and plans that formed the basis of the early
work are outlined here: https://www.notion.so/vow/Buffalo-Wings-Tissue-
Engineering-plan-e0e4d39308564b6383514d5fc3691b07

Following the successful tissue engineering experiments in March 2022 \- we
will be taking this protocol further for this experiment, but simplifying the
layout. The matrix to be used here will be exclusively Collagen I and Matrigel
based, as this was the easiest and best formed tissue engineering protocol.

Methods and Experiment Layout


Experiment layout will be consistent across each well and scaffold, as the
intention here is to produce tissues en masse under known conditions.

The exact number of scaffolds seeded will depend on the cell count at harvest,
but each scaffold will take 240 million cells. Assuming that we can harvest a
minimum of 150 million cells per fully confluent 10CF, we may be able to seed
nearly 6 scaffolds (~70 tissues). Again, assuming that each tissue weighs
~250-500mg will give us ~20-30 grams worth of wet tissue mass.

One scaffold will also be up used to seed a few experimental tissues that will
be harvested early (4-5 days after seeding) to trial transglutaminase and
desiccation.

Broadly, tissues will be seeded and formed in proliferation media for 4 days,
then switched to stage 1 differentiation media. After induction and maturation
phases, tissues will be harvested on day 18.

Before Starting

  * Calculate required cell densities and volumes of matrix ingredients for large can be found here: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1nAKlh6US6Xud95YGlDTkI4LHBWjzlAxnhmTym1P2bUw/edit#gid=0
  * Mount large scaffolds in PDMS in 15cm dishes
  * Ensure matrix reagents are made up fresh at required concentrations

Matrix reagents details for this experiment:

  * Make up matrix reagents:
    * Collagen I to 2.6mg/mL - stock is at 6.17mg/mL - dilution factor 1:2.4
      * need ~ 2 mL total (make 2.5 mL)
