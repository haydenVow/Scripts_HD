  1. Transported x2 cryovials of WCB Nuvonis suspension cells to UTS on dry ice in esky at 2:40pm
  2. Arrived at UTS at 3:00pm with vials. Freestyle (thaw) media was pre-warmed in bead bath from 10:30am same day. Brought vials into facility and prepared growth media with growth factors (1:1000 IGF and 1:5000 EGF). 30mL in x2 50ml falcon tubes
  3. Used serelogical pipette to dispense 4mL per well into an ultra-low attachment (ULA) 6-well plate. Reserved remainder of media in falcon tube
  4. Thawed cells in hood. Pipetted warm media into vial using P1000 gently until liquid phase. Added contents of x1 vial into x1 falcon tube (each) and dispensed evenly between 6-wells. 
  5. 7.5M cells in ~30mL total -> 250 000 cells per mL
