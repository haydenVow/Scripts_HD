## Performed by: Bonnie Tangey  




Note  
Seperate cell counts were performed to get an idea of growth rate post thaw,
cells were then combined into a single culture.

### Process:

1\. Took image of vessel with microscope on phase setting.

2\. Aliquotted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then
placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath for a minimum of 20 minutes
prior to use:

  1. TrypLE:        15 mL in   1      tubes
  2.  dPBS (for neutralising):   15      mL
  3.  dPBS (for washing):      15   mL
  4. Growth media (for pellet resuspension):   2 x 3    mL
  5. Growth media (for seeding):      120   mL 

Time that all aliquots were placed in the water bath the warm before use
12:55

Note: if aliquots were placed in water bath at different time, record the time
stamp for each individual solution.




4\. Removed vessel(s) from the incubator  15:00

5\. Washed the vessel(s) with dPBS (warmed).

6\. Added   5      mL tryple to each vessel/well and incubated at 37˚C.

  1. Start/Finish for TrypLE was   13:09-13:29   

7\. Neutralised with       5mL  dPBS and combined cell suspension into 3 x 15
tube.

8\. Centrifuged at 650 x g for 5 min.

  1. Start/Finish time for centrifugation was    15:23-15:28   




9\. Aspirated the supernatant(s).

10\. Resuspended pellet(s) in     2    mL      grwoth    media

11\. Aliquoted  20 ul per culture of resuspended cells into a microcentrifuge
tube for cell count.

12\. Performed a cell count using the haemocytometer and recorded the cell
count data in the Google Doc spreadsheet: Cell Count Spreadsheet or cell count
widget below

  1. Total cell number was:       8134: 1,260,000  
8135: 1,816,000  
8136: 2,816,000  

  2. Volume of cell suspension required for subculture was:       all     

  3. Cell density per vessel:      6733      




13\. Combined cultures and Transferred  cell suspension to the pre-warmed
144    mL Growth media:     16:00  

14\. Transferred cell suspension into 5 x T175   vessel.

16\. Transferred vessel(s) to incubate at:

  * [ x]  30ºC, 5% CO2, Binder Library lab #777
