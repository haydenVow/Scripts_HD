# Procedure

Aliquoted sufficient volume of relevant medias for Hoechst staining:

1)    7   mL 10C medium with   140   uL Hoechst (20 uL/mL) (sterile filtered)

2)    3   mL D/F+20%FBS+1xP/S with    60   uL of Hoechst (sterile filtered)

3)    8   mL 10C medium (no Hoechst)

4)     4  mL D/F+20%FBS+1xP/S (no Hoechst)  

  1. Added 200 uL of hoechst media to each target well of a fresh 96-WP and placed plate in incubator (wrapped in foil to avoid light exposure) Timestamp: 13:47  

  2. Remove culture and hoechst media plates from incubator and placed in the BSC 
  3. Transfer scaffolds, using a sterile tweezer, into the hoechst media plate.  
  4. Incubate cells at 37 degrees for 10 minutes. Wrap plate in foil again to avoid light exposure. 14:06 - 14:16  

  5. Removed Hoechst and replace with warmed fresh growth media (no Hoechst)   

  6. Imaged using Zaber microscope 




Imaging

  1. After incubation, the plate was placed under the Zaber microscope for imaging under the DAPI channel, 5x objective (see template for imaging here: https://au-mynotebook.labarchives.com/share/Vow%2520-%2520Team%2520Science/MTI3Mi43fDEwNjMxNy85NzkvVHJlZU5vZGUvMzEwOTgyMDE0MnwzMjMwLjc=)  
NOTE - If imaging live cells which have been hoechst stained keep samples
sterile, and only have 50ul of media per sample to prevent sample floating
(effects z-stack)

  2. Captured 1x image for each well, return plate to the incubator and using sterile tweezers flip the samples and then re-image using the zaber
  3. Once images have been stitches write notes on observations in the table below - copy and paste images and details below
  4. If fixed and DAPI stained cover the plate with foil and store in the fridge (4'C) until images deemed final
  5. If live cells (hoechst stained) add pre-warmed media to each sample and return plate to the incubator for continual culture (37'C, 5% CO2)
