Notes


pH issues:

  * The pH taken from Draw 5 was 7.77. This was a lot higher than the online reading (7.45) 
  * The pH was calibrated using the offline reading
    * This resulted in an influx of CO2 sparging which overshot the set point so was then followed by Base injection
  * Once the pH adjustment had settled we took another sample and tested the pH
    * This sat around 6.98
  * We used the new reading to recalibrate the bioreactor probe and more base was injected to get the pH to an online reading of 7.54
    * We will check the pH again this afternoon to make sure it is good before the weekend
