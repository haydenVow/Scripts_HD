### Process:

1\. Took 2 x images of each vessel with microscope on phase setting (4X to
assess confluence)

2\. Aliquoted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then
placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath for a minimum of 20 minutes
prior to use:

  1. TrypLE:    21  mL in   1 x 50 mL  tube
  2.  dPBS (for neutralising & washing):   41   mL
  3. Growth medium (for storing cells for sorting):   4  mL

Time that all aliquots were placed in the water bath the warm before use
10:05  

Note: if aliquots were placed in water bath at different time, record the time
stamp for each individual solution.




3\. Removed vessel(s) from the incubator    10:52

4\. Washed the vessel(s) with 10 mL per flask dPBS (warmed).

5\. Added   10  mL tryple to each vessel/well and incubated at 37˚C.

  1. Start/Finish for TrypLE was     11:09 - 11:24     

6\. Neutralised with   10 mL per flask   dPBS and combined cell suspension
into   1 x 50 mL  tube.

7\. Centrifuged at 650 x g for 5 min.

  1. Start/Finish time for centrifugation was     11:38 - 11:43 




8\. Aspirated the supernatant(s).

9\. Resuspended pellet(s) in   3 mL   Growth   medium. If medium is really
cloudy/we have lots of cells/cells are pelleting themselves by gravity, go
with 4 mL. If less cells, clearer cell suspension etc., go with 2 mL   12:10  

10\. Take 10uL aliquot for a cell count.

  * Total Cell count: 2,556,000 cells

10\. Stored on ice in esky
