Process:

  1. Observed the 1x T75 under the microscope to check for any interesting/ abnormal findings. 
  2. Placed the already aliquoted media into the water bath (30ºC, for reptilian cells)  19:50
  3. Removed  50 % of supernatant (6 mL) from the vessel. 
    * Note: please use separate serologicals when aspirating supernatant for each flask as they are different types of CHOMP cells
  4. Replaced with  6 mL of  growth medium. 
    * Note: please use separate serologicals when transfering the medium into each flask as they are different types of CHOMP cells)
  5. Returned vessel to incubate at:  20:20
