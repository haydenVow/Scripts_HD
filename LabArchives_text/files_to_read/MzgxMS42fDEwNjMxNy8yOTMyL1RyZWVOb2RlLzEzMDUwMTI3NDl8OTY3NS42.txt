Prepare materials for thaw and seed:

1\. Aliquotted 2 x 25 mL of growth medium into 2 x E125 flask and placed in
incubator at least 30 minutes before thaw

2\. Aliquotted 2 x 10 mL of neutralising medium (DMEM ~~  \+ 1% P/S~~) into 2
x 15 mL tube and placed in water bath

  * Time that aliquots were placed in the water bath/incubator:   13:00       

  




## Thaw and seed vial:

  1. Collected the cryovial from Liquid Nitrogen storage & place in foam floater in water bath for 5 min        13:54  
Location where cryovial was collected from:  
Vial details:  1   x  NANDO3F  cryovials & 1 x DOLLY12F at  1 million  cells
each for a total of   1 million  cells  
Brew

Tower #5  

Box #1  

Vial location: B7  

Vial ID:  1357-Culture-3905-Vial-3of32 (NANDO3)

  

  1. Brew 

Tower #2  

Box #2  

Vial location: B9  

Vial ID:  2297-Culture-6303-Vial-18of115 (DOLLY12)

  

  2. Wiped down the vial with 70% ethanol and transferred to BSC.
  3. Transferred  500 uL of neutralising medium to vial to make total volume up to 1 mL. Pipette-mixed gently. 
  4. Transferred entire 1 mL cell suspension to 10 mL aliquot of neutralising medium 
  5. Centrifuged the cells at 300 x g for 5 min at RT. 14:03 - 14:08
  6. Removed supernatant to remove residual DMSO from the cells. 
  7. Re-suspended the pellet in 10 mL of the pre-warmed growth medium in the E125 flask. Transfer the cell suspension back to the shake flask. Incubate at 37ÂºC, 5% CO2 
  8. Set shaker to continuous shaking at 130 RPM. 14:25``

  

Making labels

Note - You will need to increase the passage number by one. (i.e. if your
thawed vial ID has a passage number of 3, when you make a culture ID for you
vessel you will need change the passage number to 4 on Airtable.)
