    * 6 mL of dPBS 
    * 24 drops of NucBlue Live Cell Stain ReadyProbes Hoechst 33342

### Observations/Summary:

Opentron observations/issues:

1) Protocol requires 7 x 50 mL tube racks, however we only have 6 x 50 mL tube
racks and 1 x 50/15 mL tube rack. Had to go back and adjust protocol to
account for this.

2) Ran protocol and saw that pipette was hitting bottom of media tube when
aspirating fresh media. Had to go back and adjust protocol - raised aspirate
height to 5 mm from 1 mm and made single-use protocol with adjusted first few
steps to account for the steps that had already been completed.

3) Rep 3 of culture 9 appeared to have received only ~3 mL of medium rather
than 5 mL. There was also excess medium left in the medium tube. Manually
transferred remaining 2 mL into culture. Checked protocol, final deck state
does not show this - it says that medium should have 500 uL remaining
remaining and that rep 3 of culture 9 should have 5.4 uL. This was also the
case for rep 3 of culture 18. Possibly there is some problem with the final
feed step of the protocol.

4) Noticed that the aspirate height for removing medium from cultures was a
lot lower than I had set it when I watched it do the final culture. Checked
protocol and it appears that sometimes when you duplicate steps, it resets the
aspiration height to default height (1 mm). This may have impacted cultures
7-9 as it may have aspirated cells/pellets.

5) staining plate had low volumes and bubbles in some wells - think pipette
was hitting bottom of tube when aspirating to take 100 uL sample so edited
protocol to aspirate from 2 mm not 0.5 mm

  

Zaber observations/issues: changing the acqusition settings after scanning
plate caused the image save settings to reset.
