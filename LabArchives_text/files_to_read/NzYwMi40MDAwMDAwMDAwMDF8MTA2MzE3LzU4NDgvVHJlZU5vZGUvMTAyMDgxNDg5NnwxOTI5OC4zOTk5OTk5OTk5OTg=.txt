Results  
Initially, 5 x F_CHOMP09 MCB vials were seeded (estimated 2.2M cells although
a count was not performed prior to seeding thawed cells). These cells were
then expanded in culture for 27 days and underwent 4 passages before being
banked as a WCB of 2.20 billion cells. The average doubling time over the
course of the expansion was 2.89 days (see table bellow), which is comparable
to our previous F_CHOMP09 expansion. See lab book here: https://au-

WCB vails were banked as 130 x 15M vials and 25x 10M vials.
