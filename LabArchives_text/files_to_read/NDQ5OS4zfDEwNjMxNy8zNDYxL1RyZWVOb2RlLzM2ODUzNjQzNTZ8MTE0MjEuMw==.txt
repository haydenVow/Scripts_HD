Process:

  1. Place both media blocks in an incubator to warm up media   09:15 - 09:59 am 
    1. Note - both of the 96 deep well plates did not have parafilm over them and the lids had peeled up from the bottom at the ned of the warm-up phase in the incubator. I pressed it down with my gloved hands as son as this was noticed, but the bottom wells of the plate had been exposed to the incubator air for an unknown amount of time.
  2. Please check plates under microscope to ensure there are cells in both plates. Note down yes/no in the "Observations" section below.
  3. Briefly spin the 96 deep-well plates down in the centrifuge to collect all the media. 20 seconds at 800g is appropriate.
  4. Removed   100 % of supernatant from vessel. Change tips for each column.
  5. Replaced with   140uL (per well/per vessel) of   DSD  media. Change tips for each column.
  6. Returned vessel to incubate at: 10:28 am (last plate)

  * [X]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (aviary cells)

  

  * Incubator (Sanyo bottom), Lab [Main]

Please foil wrap DSD media blocks after feed and place back in Biomaterials
fridge

  

Note - I accidentally fed both plates with block 1 media. Plate #2 was exposed
to the media form block 1 for ~20 minutes before I recognised my mistake. I
then changed the media in all wells of plate #2 with the correct media from
block 2. However in my haste I performed this action with plate #2 upside
down, so the media was changed in the wrong order. I recognised this as I
completed the feed and was placing the lid on the plate. I then immediately
removed the media from all wells and put the correct media from block 2 into
each well.




### Observations/Summary:

Both plates were spot-checked in 6-7 locations for cell presence - There were
cells in all wells that were checked.

Mistake was made in feeding of plate 2 - see Note in the text box above for
full details.

100% media changed on both plates
