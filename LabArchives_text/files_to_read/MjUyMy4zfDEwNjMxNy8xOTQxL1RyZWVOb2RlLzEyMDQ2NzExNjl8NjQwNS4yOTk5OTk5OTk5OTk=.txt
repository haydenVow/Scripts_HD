Aim/Purpose


To determine whether Fibrolife can support proliferation of suspension-adapted
fibroblast cells.


Hypothesis


That Fibrolife (made in-house) can provide fibroblasts with the nutrients
needed to proliferate in suspension culture.


Technical Gap


Fibrolife was used a a condition of ACF media to see whether it can be used
for adherent fibroblast culture. After the first passage, cells were seen to
have detached from the surface of the flask, yet after a trypan blue check
under a hemocytometer, there were still plenty of live cells that were in
suspension.

Those cells are to be transferred from the supernatant of the original flask
into a 50mL shake tube and grown at 37ÂºC, 5% CO2 at 206 RPM.


Method/Procedure


  1. Transfer Fibrolife suspension cells from 1 x T75 to 1 x 50mL shake tube
  2. Prepare 30mL Fibrolife media.
  3. Centrifuge, 100% feed and trypan blue count (Friday 18th June)
  4. Centrifuge, 100% feed and trypan blue count (Monday 21st June)
  5. Determine whether cells have proliferated. If yes, continue to Centrifuge, 100% feed and trypan blue count every 2 days until cells have reached >10M cells / mL.
  6. If high cell density is achieved, expand to larger vessels and generate MCB of suspension-adapted fibroblasts.
