Ideas:

James platinum electrodes (inert as opposed to Cu which will "dissolve")

initially we need to both send the electrical signal from the power source
into the culture, and at the same time measure the output to ensure Amplitude,
waveform and length are as expected!

  

"the distal tendon of the muscle was tied to a fixed pin in the organ bath,
while the proximal tendon was attached to the lever arm of a dual-mode
servomotor (305-LR, Aurora Scientific, Aurora, Ontario, Canada). Platinum
plate electrodes flanked the muscle on either side. Muscles were field
stimulated by supramaximal square-wave pulses (0.2-ms duration) that were
amplified (EP500B Power Amplifier, Audio Assemblers, Campbellfield, Victoria,
Australia) to produce a current intensity sufficient to produce a maximum
isometric tetanic contraction (Po)."
