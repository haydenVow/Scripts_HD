Calculations

For suspension cultures: 250 uL hoechst 1mg/mL + 750 uL MilliQ - add 20 uL in
200 uL

Need at least 20 uL with multi-channel pipette - so have to half conc and
double volume

For adherent clones: 384WP have 80 -100 uL - add 20 uL/well. 20 x 384 x 4 =
30720 + error = 40 mL  = 0.5 mL Hoechst 10 mg/mL + 39.5 mL MilliQ

Process

  1. Make up Hoechst solution:
    1. 0.5 mL hoechst (10 mg/mL) + 39.5 mL MilliQ (250 ug/mL)   

    2. Sterile filter using syringe filter
  2. Add 11 uL per well to each corner well of 1 x 384-well plate (total 111 uL - 10 ug/mL hoechst)  

  3. Allow to incubate at RT in the dark for 20 minutes           16:53 - 17:13  

  4. Check on Zaber microscope if cells are fluorescing on DAPI channel   

  5. If the cells are fluorescing, repeat steps 2 and 3 with all wells of 4 x 384-well plates   

  6. If cells are not fluorescing, double Hoechst concentration and repeat test with corner wells of second 384-well plate  

  7. Stain timestamp: Plates 1&2 17:15 - 17:35
