Growth Media:

  * [x]  DMEM/F12 + 20% FBS + 1X P/S + P38i (10uM)

  




### Process:

1\. Images captured of single cell clone plates from 3/6/21 were processed
using the machine learning algorithm to identify wells for picking.

2\. wells with cell numbers in the 95% percentile of those on the plate were
picked for expansion to 96 well plates. This ended up being wells with 3 or
more cells per well.

3\. Clone picking maps were generated [12-2pm] in the following spreadsheet
based on this selection criteria.
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1YB6I5aMkVNGZpw7XywnhXbE1x1eTlTawCxAFSpn9BTo/edit?usp=sharing

  

2\. Gelatin coated     4     x     96wp     with sterile 50uL filtered 0.1%
gelatin solution and then incubated all coated flasks at 37˚C.

  1. Time when all vessels(s) placed into the incubator      14:27 

3\. Aliquotted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then
placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath for a minimum of 20 minutes
prior to use:

  1. TrypLE:     8    mL in    1x15mL     .
  2. Growth media (for seeding):     80    mL in     1x120mL    container. 

Time that all aliquots were placed in the water bath the warm before use
14:40   a/pm

Note: if aliquots were placed in water bath at different time, record the time
stamp for each individual solution.




4\. Once 96 well plates had incubated for 1h with gelatin the gelatin was
removed and replaced with 200uL of the prewarmed growth media. The plates were
left inside the incubator, 37 degrees, 5% CO2.  

Wells due for passaging from the 384 well plates were marked on the outside of
the lid and inside well edge.

Removed 384 wp vessel(s) from the incubator  
Plate 1   16:00  

Plate 2  16:29

Plate 3 16:35

Plate 4-10 (not tracked)

  
5\. Washed wells identified from the picklist generated below with 50uL of
dPBS after removing and discarding growth media.







6\. Aspirated and discarded the dPBS and incubated the same wells in     0.02
mL tryple at 37˚C.

  1. Start/Finish for TrypLE (20 minutes) was  
Plate 6943    16:26  
Plate 6944    16:30  
Plate 6945    16:36  
Plate 6946   17:04  
Plate 6947   17:11  
Plate 6948   17:20  
Plate 6950   17:28  
Plate 6951   16:45  
Plate 6952   17:44  
Plate 6953   17:49  
  

7\. Neutralised by aspirating the tryple contents for each well and combining
it with the destination well on the 96 well plates as per the plate maps
above.

8\. Returned 96 well plates to incubate at 37 degrees, 5% CO2.

  * Plate 4: 18:20
  * Plate 2: 18:40
  * Plate 1: 17:40
  * Plate 3:  (not tracked)

Some wells did not have tryple added to them as the inside oft he well was not
labelled prior to tryple addition. Passaging of these unfortunately missed.
These included the following wells.

Wells, D7, D8, D9 and F12 on plate 2.  
Wells, A5, A12, and B1 on plate 3.

The plate maps in the google spreadsheet were updated to reflect this change

Observations/Summary:

  * Manual handling during the washing, tryple addition, neutralising and addition to 96 well plates was the most time consuming process and most limiting to further throughput.
  * Jared, Bec and Nathan were all involved in the expansion of 384 well plates, Each passaged ~96 clones over the 4 hours, with Shaleen swapping out for Bec at one point.
