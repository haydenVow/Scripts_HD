Aim/Purpose


To determine whether gelatin coating well baes or adding FGF basic to our
media will impact F_DOLLY12 cell survival and growth after single cell
sorting.


Hypothesis


We hypothesis that exposure of cells to gelatin coated wells and FGF
containing media will produce the highest percentage of surviving clones after
14 days.


Technical Gap


We want to optimize our cloning process for fibroblasts, obtaining as many
viable clones as possible by the first expansion stage of the experiments
(384wp>96wp expansion). This experiment aims to test 2 conditions to see if
they help cell survival at early stages of our cloning process.

Additional detail for experiment method.

Prepare plates and Media for FACs

6x384wp preparation (see plate diagram)  
\- For each plate coat columns 13-24 with 20uL of 0.1% sterile filtered
gelatin. Incubate all plates for 1h at 37 degrees,  
\- Remove gelatin from all plates.

\- Add 60uL of DMEM/F12 + 20% FBS + 1xP/S  (unconditioned) to columns 1-6,
13-18 on all plates  
\- Add 60uL of DMEM/F12 + 20% FBS + 1xP/S + 100ng/mL FBF basic to columns
7-12, 19-24 on all plates.  
\- Parafilm wrap plates on inside and around edges, store at 4 degrees
overnight.

Single cell sort, Garvan run..

  * Prepare two styrofoam boxes to transfer to the Garvan. 
    * BOX A with the 6 x pre-growth media-filled 384-well plates, parafilmed, an ice pack, Hoechst (ddH20), extra 20mL FACS Buffer (PRF DMEM/F12 + 2% FBS) and the tubes containing cells.
    * BOX B with 12 sheets of parafilm for sealing plates closed (6 needed, 6 excess) and spare tubes for the operator. 
  * Prepare 5mL of DMEM/F12 + 20% FBS + 1xP/S (unconditioned) and store in the fridge at 4 degrees.
  * Harvest cells and resuspend 1x10^6 cells in 2mL of of cold growth media in a 15mL tube (final conc 5x10^5 cells/mL). 
  * Place the cell suspension on ice in BOX A. 
  * Drive to the Garvan
  * For FACS operator to do
    1. Collect the entire 2 mL cell suspension in Growth Media (DMEM/F12 + 20% FBS + 1X P/S) . Sample name = F_DOLLY12
    2. Centrifuge at 300 x g for 5 min at 4ºC.
    3. Aspirate supernatant. Add cold FACS Buffer (PRF DMEM/F12 2% FBS) to the pellet (without dislodging it).
    4. Centrifuge at 300 x g for 5 min at 4ºC.
    5. Aspirate supernatant carefully from the tube.
    6. Resuspend pellet in 200µL FACS Buffer (PRF DMEM/F12 containing 2% FBS).
    7. Sort cells based on forward and side scatter into individual wells of 6 x 384-well plates. 30 events to A1, A24, P1 and P24,  1 event for the remaining wells. 
    8. After sort, parafilm plates and then close with lid. Parafilm the edges of the sealed plates.
    9. Centrifuge plates at 300 x g for 10 min at RT at the Garvan.
    10. Leave plates to incubate at 37 degrees, 5% CO2 while additional plates are sorted. 
  * Transport plates in a styrofoam box WITHOUT an ice pack (remove ice pack so box is ~ RT) back to VOW HQ. Leave plates to incubate at 37ºC degrees, 5% CO2, in VOW (Library lab) incubator.

  

Post Sort Zaber scanning:

Using the Zaber, image each well on PHASE channel, 5x objective, 2 row by 1
column stitching. Return cultures to the incubator after imaging.

Expansion of 384wp to 96wp, Generating picklists:

  * Remove plates from the incubator and add Hoechst 33342 to the wells (final conc.     ) 
  * Using the Zaber, image each well on PHASE channel and DAPI channel, 5x objective, 2 row by 1 column stitching. 
  * Process the images using a FIJI macro to generate cell counts for each well. Record how long this process takes. Transfer the raw FIJI data to a google spreadsheet.
  * Identify top performing clones (condition of top performer:     ) and generate a picklist from each plate. 
  * Review the pick lists to inspect cell morphology and select clones to expand to 96 well plate stage. (see clone selection guide here https://www.notion.so/vow/Clone-Selection-Guide-315ab64bc8744a86a9e538970539fdb9)

Everything below this point needs revision. Will automation be used for liquid
passaging of 384 well plates? Will gelatin coating and FGF containing media be
used for all subsequent passages for the relevant clones?  
  
Passaging 384 well plates.

  * Expand best growing clones to 96-well plates, as determined from the picklists. 
  * The well location of each selected clone will form part of the clone ID in all future culture ID's derived from this clone.
  * Use a permanent marker to circle around the wells selected on the lid of the 96-well plates (so that when you are in the BSC you know which wells are to be selected)
  * Gelatin coat X x 96-well plates (number to be determined based on number of growing clones) manually with 50uL of 0.1% gelatin solution . Incubate at 37ºC for at least 1 hour.
  * Once incubated, replace gelatin with 0.2mL per well of respective growth media in the destination wells.
  * Aspirate flask supernatant.
  * Wash each selected well with 50 uL dPBS.
  * Add 20 µL of Tryple to each well. Incubate at 37ºC for 15-25 min.
  * Check regularly under the microscope to see if cells across all wells are detaching.
  * When ~80% of all cells have detached OR Tryple time reaches 30 minutes, use the P200 pipette (set at 100 uL) to neutralise each well with 100 uL of pre-warmed growth media and collect that into its designated destination well containing 0.2 mL.
  * Leave the cells to rest at RT for 30 minutes before moving them to the incubator at 37 degrees, 5% CO2. 
  * In a spreadsheet, mark the original 384 plate and well location down on the 96 well plate to highlight the original origin of the clone. (eg. if the cells from well P13 on 384 well plate #3 are passaged into Well A1 on a 96 well plate, the cell line in the 96 well plate will hence be referred to as BUFFY6_3P13)

Feeding 96 well plates [D2P]:

  * Warm up enough growth media to feed each well on the 96 well plates with 50uL of growth media. 
  * Add the growth media directly to the wells and return the plates to the incubator. 

Imaging 96 well plates [D3P]/[D4P]

  * Using the Zaber, image each well on PHASE channel, 5x objective. 
  * Process the images using the Machine learning algorithm to generate clone pick lists, Time how long this process takes.
  * Scientists will then be required to review the pick lists and inspect cell morphology and select clones to expand to the 24 well plate stage. (see clone selection guide here https://www.notion.so/vow/Clone-Selection-Guide-315ab64bc8744a86a9e538970539fdb9)

  * When ~80% of all cells have detached OR Tryple time reaches 30 minutes, use the P200 pipette (set at 100 uL) to neutralise each well with 100 uL of pre-warmed growth media and collect that into its designated destination well containing 0.5 mL. 
  * Leave the cells to rest at RT for 30 minutes before moving them to the incubator at 37 degrees, 5% CO2. 
  * In a spreadsheet, ensure the Cell line ID is linked to the new location on each 24 well plate. 
  * DISCARD THE 384 well plates at this step

Feeding 24 well plates [D1P]:

  * Warm up enough growth media to perform a 50% media change (0.25mL/well) for all wells containing clones.
