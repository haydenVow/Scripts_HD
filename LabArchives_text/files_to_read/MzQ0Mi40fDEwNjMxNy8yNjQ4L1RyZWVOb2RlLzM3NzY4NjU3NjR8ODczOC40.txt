Aim/Purpose


To screen for media ingredients known to promote serum-free differentiation as
identified in literature. Specifically, this experiment aims to look at the
impact of adding these factors to our E6 media after cells have been
proliferated in ACF media (E89C).


Hypothesis


From the 16 factors tested, we will be to identify at least 3 factors that can
be added to E6 differentiation media to promote differentiation.


Technical Gap


We have not tested the impact of adding the following ingredients to our
differentiation media before: B-27 supplement, GDNF, NT3, NT4, aFGF, VEGF-165,
CNTF, CT-1, BDNF, BMP2, LIF, EGF, IGF1-LR3, fibronectin, and vitronectin. See
here for more details on each factor:

    * Example reconstitution protocol
      1. centrifuge vial containing powdered factor for 10 seconds
      2. Bring factor to recommended reconstitution concentration by adding the recommended reconstitution buffer to vial and mix thoroughly via pipetting solution up and down 5-10 times within the vial.
      3. make 20uL aliquots of the concentrated stock, placing in a 2mL micro-centrifuge snap tube labeled with the factor's name, concentration, date, and your initials.
      4. Store unused aliquots at -20C.
  4. Prepare working stocks of each factor
    1. Refer to the "Factor Calcs" tab of your pipeline calculator to find uL amounts of `"DMEM/F12"` and concentrated stock needed to create a working stock for each factor.
    2. Label one 96 Deep Well Plate as "Stock Plate", and add the uL amount of `"DMEM/F12"`for each factor in the following arrangement:
      1. Factor 1 through 8- A1 through H1
      2. Factor 9 through 16- A2 through H2
    3. Next, add the uL amount of `concentrated stock` for each factor to the stock plate using the same arrangement as above.

    2. Add `1.2mL` of 50x E6 bullet to A3 of the stock plate.
  6. Immediately prior to running the OT2 mixing protocol, use a multichannel pipette to thoroughly mix the working stocks by pipetting the solutions up and down 5-10 times within their respective wells.  DO NOT MIX THE WORKING STOCKS WITH EACH OTHER!
  7. Run the following OT2 mixing protocol to make DSD conditions: 'XXXX-XX-XX-XXX-X-XXXX-XXXX-X-XXXXX'

    * fresh E6 control in wells A12 and D12
    * E6 bullet control in wells B12 and E12
