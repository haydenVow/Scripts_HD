### Process:

1\. Took image of vessel with microscope on phase setting.

3\. Aliquotted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then
placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath for a minimum of 20 minutes
prior to use:

  1. TrypLE:     50    mL in     1 x 50mL Centrifuge    tubes
  2.  dPBS (for washing and neutralising):     2 x 50mL    mL in    2 x 50mL Centrifuge    tubes
  3. Growth media (for pellet resuspension):     5    mL in         tubes
  4. Growth media (for seeding):     700    mL in    1 x 200mL and 1 x 500mL Sample Pot     tubes

Time that all aliquots were placed in the water bath the warm before use
08:02   a/pm

Note: if aliquots were placed in water bath at different time, record the time
stamp for each individual solution.




4\. Removed vessel(s) from the incubator     8:12   a/pm

5\. Washed the vessel(s) with dPBS (warmed).

6\. Added     10    mL tryple to each vessel/well and incubated at 37˚C.

Flask was checked at 08:41 for detachment, only 50% was observed.

  1. Start/Finish for TrypLE was     08:31 - 08:52  a/pm 

7\. Neutralised with     10     dPBS and combined cell suspension into a     2
x 50mL Centrifuge Tubes    tube.

8\. Centrifuged at 650 x g for 5 min.

  1. Start/Finish time for centrifugation was     09:02   a/pm 




9\. Aspirated the supernatant(s).

10\. Resuspended pellet(s) in     3    mL     Growth     media     09:13
a/pm

11\. Aliquoted     20uL x 2      of resuspended cells into a microcentrifuge
tube for cell count.

12\. Performed a cell count using the haemocytometer and recorded the cell
count data in the Google Doc spreadsheet called 'Cell Count Spreadsheet' (see
link below):

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1DPzKubYxfHmWogVPihC-
SSIBtIylyrBQE5kRX5Z8NtI/edit#gid=0

  1.  Total cell number was:     ~ 2.8 Million Cells        

  2. Volume of cell suspension required for subculture was:       3mL      

  3. Cell density per vessel:     2.8M       




13\. Transferred      3000     µl of cell suspension to the pre-warmed
500 + 200mL    mL Growth media:      09:35    a/pm

14\. Transferred cell suspension into the pre-gelatin coated      5CS
vessel.

15\. Left at RT in the BSC for 30 min to allow cells to settle      09:42  -
10:20 a/pm  

16\. Transferred vessel(s) to incubate at:

  * [X]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (avian cells)
