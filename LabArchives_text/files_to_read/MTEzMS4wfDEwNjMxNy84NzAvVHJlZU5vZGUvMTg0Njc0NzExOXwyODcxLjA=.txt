Background:  
  
Although not ideal we have found that the Russell Hobbs Toaster Oven can
maintain relatively stable temperatures, but is prone to over-shooting. To
accomodate for this the oven was initially set to 100'C and observed very
closely and the set point incrementally increased over two hours (oven would
be switched off if temperatures went above 150'C, which is above the point at
which the gelatex samples are considered stable). In this test we dry-heat
sterilsed n=1 gelatex zein and n=1 gelatex gelatin samples and then placed the
samples in cell culture conditions in antibiotic free media to observe for any
signs of contamination over the course of 7 days.  
  
Process:  
  
1\. Approximately 1cm square sections of both Zein and Gelatin were cut using
sterile tweezers in the BSC.  
2\. Samples were placed in oven proof bags (claim to be safe to 150 degrees)  
3\. Placed temperature probe into the oven for heat monitoring.  
4\. Placed samples into the toaster oven and set the oven to 150 degrees.

After 1 minute, the oven had reached 100 degrees Celsius and the oven bags had
melted.

5\. As the bags clearly can not be used at high temperatures, new samples were
taken and placed into a glass beaker for sterilisation. foil was placed over
the opening of the beaker and placed in the toaster oven.

10:50: Oven set to 100 degrees.  
10:00: Temperature reading was 120 degrees (while set at 100).  
10:55: Temperature increased to to 130 degrees.  
11:00: Temperature reading 150 degrees (while set at 130)  
11:10: Temperature reading dropped to 130 degrees, so increased temp to 150 on
dial. Samples look OK.  
11:40: Temperature reading 140 degrees (while set to 150), so increased
slightly.  
12:09: Temperature reading 149 degrees. Samples look OK.  
12:35: Temperature reading 148 degrees.  
12:45: Temperature reading 145 degrees. Samples look OK. Turned oven off.

6\. To check sterilisation success: In the BSC, samples were transferred to 2
wells of a 24 well plate with sterile tweezers. Samples were dry and brittle,
with a small flake coming off the zein. The gelatin scaffold was not damages
during transfer and had better structural integrity. 1mL of growth media
(DMEM/F12 + 20% FBS + 1x p/s) added to each well 15:45

7\. Realised that media had pen/strep in it which would inhibit the growth of
any possible contaminants so removed growth media and replaced with DMEM only
17:25

17:45 After 24hours in the cell culture incubator, scaffolds show no signs of
contamination. Media is not cloudy, and no contamination could be seen under
the microscope.

Scaffolds could easily be picked up with tweezers and did not break. Returned
to the incubator at 17:50




20/05/2021 After 7 days, there was still no sign of contamination, and both
scaffolds could still handled easily with tweezers. Both samples have a 'skin-
like' texture.  
  
This finding gives us confidence in our dry-heat sterilisation process.  
  
The samples were discarded.
