Process:

  1. Aliquoted:
    1.  25 mL  of  DMEM + 10% FBS + 1xP/S  
      * Added 250 uL of "Anti-Clumping Agent" to aliquot (found in door of fridge 104, small clear bottle with white lid - there is also a 100 mL bottle but we haven't finished the small bottle yet so please use this first) 
    2. 10 mL of D/F + 10% FBS + 1xP/S 
    3. 10 mL of D/F + 5% FBS + 1:100 ACA + 1xP/S  
Placed in water bath: 14:45  

  2. Collected culture vessels from shakers, wiped with ethanol-sprayed cloth and brought into BSC (if necessary, paused shakers by pressing the "play" button on the controller on the side wall of the incubator)
  3. Using a 5 mL serelogical pipette, gently pipette-mixed cultures for ~1 minute to break up cell clumps
  4. Pipetted suspensions though 70 um cell strainer into 3 x 50 mL tubes (keep E125 flask and spin tubes in BSC as cultures will be returned to these post centrifugation) 
  5. Centrifuged at 300 x g for 5 min. Timestamp: 15:25 - 15:30     

  6. Aspirated supernatants, taking care to not disrupt or aspirate pellet
  7. Re-suspended culture 7342 in 500 uL of growth media. Re-suspended cultures 7415 & 7417 in 10 mL of respective growth media.
  8. Took 1 x 20 uL aliquots from 7342 and performed cell count, recording counts in this spreadsheet https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1YuTvXJXQQMIMwRZGeqNjdi20WeURg5FpM-1TJ-zrb1c/edit#gid=1104649984
    1. Average(1,4,2,6,2) = 3 cells/mm^2
    2. 3 cells/mm^2 x 10,000 = 30,000 cells/mL
    3. 30,000 cells/mL x 0.720 mL = 21,600 cells
  9. Replaced fresh, warmed media in culture 7342 
  10. Gently pipette-mixed cultures again before moving back to E125 flask and 2 x spin tubes
  11. Returned vessels to incubator and replaced in clamp. If shaker was paused, remembered to press play to restart shaking. Spin tubes should be shaking at 206 RPM and E125 at 130 RPM) Timestamp:  15:45
