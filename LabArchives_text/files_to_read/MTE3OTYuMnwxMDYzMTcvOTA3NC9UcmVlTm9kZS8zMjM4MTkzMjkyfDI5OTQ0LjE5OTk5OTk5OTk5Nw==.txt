to record the incubator number! Cell culture ID:

Process:  

  1. Because of contamination identified in the SILKIE continuous culture, culture 13047 was inspected for contamination prior to any feeding. 
  2. The culture was transferred to the BSC and 200uL of media was removed and added to a 24 well plate. 
  3. The plate was sealed with parafilm and then transferred to the microscope to view under the 20x objective. 
  4. Images were captured where contamination was evident (see images below) 
  5. Culture was then discarded and the BSC and incubators were deep cleaned




REFERENCE IMAGES:  
  
Images were captured under PHASE microscopy using a 20x objective.
Contamination was evident as fiberous and spindle like formations. Commonly
appeared as a 'web' attaching to cells.
