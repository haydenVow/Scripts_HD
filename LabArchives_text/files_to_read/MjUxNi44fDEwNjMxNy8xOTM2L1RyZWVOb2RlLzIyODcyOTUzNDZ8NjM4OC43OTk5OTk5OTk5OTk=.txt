RELATED TO MILESTONE: Milestone 2:

AIM/PURPOSE: To assess whether MuSCs (DOLLY12) adhere and maintain adherence
to ECM scaffolds derived from fibroblasts (freeze-thawed).

HYPOTHESIS:  That DOLLY12 cells will be able to adhere and differentiate on
ECM scaffolds derived from fibroblasts (freeze-thawed).  

RESULTS SUMMARY:  See "Report write up"

CONCLUSIONS: MuSC adherence could be maintained on the fibroblast scaffolds
for up to 17 days in continuous culture and were able to undergo myogenic
differentiation in several of the conditions tested. CMFDA live cell staining
could only be detected on the Day 1 of culture, and no Vimentin or MF20
staining could be observed in any of the experimental conditions.

NEXT STEPS:

1. Improve the structural integrity of the fibroblast ECM scaffolds, to enhance their rigidity, handling and general workability as scaffold suitable for MuSC seeding.

2\. Continue optimising the CMFDA live cell tracker stain to determine if the
same cell sample can be continuously stained with this dye over a extended
period.

3. Investigate alterative methods to fluorescent microscopy for the assessment of differentiation, fusion, and maturation of MuSC, such as ELISA or total protein assays.
