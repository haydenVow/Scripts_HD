Quick mix DNA extractions of CHOMP07 were prepared using the bento lab
following the protocol below

  1. Frozen cell pellets were removed from the -20 freezer
  2. Added 25μl of QuickExtract to each of the cell pellets
  3. Briefly spun down tubes using a microfuge
  4. pipetted suspensions up and down
  5. Transferred solutions to individual PCR tubes, ran the protocol below. 
    * 65°c 6 mins
    * 98°c 2 mins

Extractions were then placed in the fridge in the main lab in yellow top 70mL
containers.

  




## Observations:

Frozen cell pellets were not visible upon visual inspection prior to addition
of QuickExtract. Tubes were spun in the minifuge for 15 seconds before
QuickExtract was added to ensure cells were at the base of the tube. The
resulting DNA extractions were not very viscous compared with previous Quick
extract testing.
