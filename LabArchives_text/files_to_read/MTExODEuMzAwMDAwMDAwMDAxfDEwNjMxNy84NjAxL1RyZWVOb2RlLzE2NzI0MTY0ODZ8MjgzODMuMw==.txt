Note  
  
In order to take a quick look at the likelihood of lactate being beneficial to
our embryonic duck eye cells (see background for justification), media will be
preconditioned by culturing Nuvonis cells at 240,000 cells/mL for 24hrs. Spent
media will then be sterile filtered, prior to seeding one of the suspension
adaption trial conditions with duck-eye cells. 6 million cells were gifted by
the Media Optimization team to be used in this experiment.  




Process

1\. 25mL of Nuvonis suspension media was warmed to 37C in the waterbath (>20
min)

2\. EGF (10ng/mL) IGF (50ng/mL) and FGF (100ng/mL) added to media

3\. 6 million Nuvonis cells added to the media, and transferred to a e-125
flask.

4\. Flask transferred to the cell culture incubator, 37C, 5% CO2, with a
shaking speed of 120RPM.
