RELATED TO OKR:

  * KR1: Develop a QMS-compliant serum-free media that supports 20+ doublings of our chosen species in suspension 
  * KR4: Establish and run a suspension pipeline at a rate of 10,000 clones per month.

AIM/PURPOSE:

  * To compare suspension adaptation of F_CHOMP09 cells in E125 flasks in various formulations of serum-free media
  * To see whether F_CHOMP09 cells can adapt to suspension in CD CHO + 20% KSR + 11G supplement.
  * 11G supplement = 20% KSR + 1:100 glutamax, lipid supplement 1:1000, 1 g/L pluronic, 1:100 ACA, 100ng/mL each of FGF, IGF1, PDGF, RGD 100 ng/mL, and YIGSR 100 ng/mL +1x p/s

HYPOTHESIS:

  * Cells will adapt to suspension adaption better (higher cells/mL will be achieved) in E125 flask.  
  * CHOMP cells will adapt to suspension in CD CHO + 20% KSR + 11G supplement .  
  
  

RESULTS SUMMARY: This should only be completed if the data can be visualised
with a single graph/image, otherwise simply state "See Report".

CONCLUSIONS: What were the overall findings? This should be a concise summary
and not duplicate the information in the results/report. For example "We found
that Bovine MuSCs could only achieve a cell density 50% of that observed with
planar culture without undergoing precocious differentiation. These results
mean that we are currently limited to X cells/ml in suspension culture until
we find a way to inhibit precocious differentiation"

NEXT STEPS: This should be a dot point list of any immediate outcomes, changes
to SOPs, as well as providing a direct link to any new experiments arising
from these findings. Importantly, this section should also include any
potential DEPLOYMENTS to the production team
