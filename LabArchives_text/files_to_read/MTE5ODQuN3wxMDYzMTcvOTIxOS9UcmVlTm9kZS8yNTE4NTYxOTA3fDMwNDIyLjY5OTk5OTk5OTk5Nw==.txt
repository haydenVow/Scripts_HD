Concisely state the main results without your interpretations behind it. For
example: 'molecule x increased glucose uptake of myoblasts', rather than
'molecule x increased glucose uptake of myoblasts indicating that glucose
uptake is controlled by pathway y'. Results should be directly relevant to the
aims of the experiment.

Why? This format allows the reader to quickly to see and digest the results
and their significance in an impartial way. Interpretations to the results
will be added in the Report/discussion.

  
  


Figures


Add all figures (graphs, tables, images) into this section with respective
captions (captions are written below figures for graphs and above for tables).

The figure caption should include the following information: What data is
being shown and what time point it relates to, how many replicates were used
n=?, abbreviation meanings, units of measurement, significance threshold e.g.
P ≤ 0.05 (if relevant), what the error bars represent e.g. std dev, microscope
magnifications and dyes used (if relevant).

Why? Visual aids present data more clearly, detailed captions are necessary to
fully understand what is being shown.
