Brief background


The DOLLY12_15D11 clone was generated and banked at MCB2 in March 2021:

Vials of the clone were then expanded (in both planar cultureware and
microcarrier culture in parallel) from MCB2 to WCB2 in May 2021: https://au-

In this experiment, WCB2 vials from both planar and microcarrier culture were
thawed and the cells were cultured with the intention of expanding over at
least 10x doublings, terminating in the Biostat A 2 L bioreactor. Cells were
also seeded into a differentiation assay to ensure that the capability of
differentiation into muscle tissue had not been lost.

Demonstrating 10x doublings and differentiation capability of the clonal WCB2
cells demonstrates the suitability and process for the use of these clones by
the production team.
