Process:

  1. Aliquotted  21 mL  mL of  Growth Media 
  2. Added   10.5 uL  mL of p38i. 
  3. Placed in water bath 10:56 - 11:50 am 
  4. Removed 100% of supernatant from vessel. 
  5. Replaced with 1mL (per well/per vessel) of Growth media. 
  6. Returned vessel to incubate at: : am

  * [X]  37ºC @ 12:20 pm, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (aviary cells)

  

  * Incubator (#120), Lab Main




### Observations/Summary:

 100 % media changed on all vessel(s)

Plate 1 (Lam, Col, Gel, ECM)

Laminin (A1, B1, C1) and gelatin (A3, B3, C3) wells look ready for diff, very
confluent

Collagen wells (column 2) looking a little sparse

ECM wells (column 4) looking a bit chaotic - floating bits everywhere, cell
debris and possible component of the ECM gel

  

Plate 2 (Fibrin, MyoCult, Alginate)

Fibrin wells have formed a thin film that covers the right half of the well,
with cells outside the film appearing to be more confluent

MyoCult wells look good, ready for diff

Alginate well 1 (A3) has a ruptured film in the centre (no cells where the
film was covering) - other two wells are not looking too bad, though are quite
sparsely populated compared to the MyoCult wells
