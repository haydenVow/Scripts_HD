Treatment Used:

TGFb (10ng/mL) + VitC (50ug/mL) applied at 7 days after seeding into roller
bottles.  
Roller bottles were fed with treated media every 2-3 days until harvest.

Notable Events/Batch Issues:

  * Due to a lack of obvious benefit from co-cultures in roller bottles and a lack of available roller bottle apparatus' Myoblasts were not seeded into roller bottles and only 4 roller bottles were seeded with Fibroblasts only @15kcells/cm2
    * Some of the Myoblast flasks were harvested by science and others were discarded due to contamination.
  * After 2 days of treatment 3 out of 4 roller bottle spontaneously peeled. 
    * Peeling description: in these 3 bottle the cell sheet peeled in pieces rather than one complete cell sheet. The cell sheet was also quite thin and peeling was not complete across the whole surface.
  * The remaining roller bottle peeled after 17 days of treatment and displayed a thick, continuous cell sheet that peeled by rolling up the bottle to the neck.

Achievements:

  * Largest ever roller bottle yield! (1.6609g) and longest time until peeling. The previous PB was 1.5252g which was achieved with VitC ONLY treatment.

Deviations:

  * Originally designed to be a co-culture but only Fibroblasts were seeded into roller bottles
  * Meant to go into 80x roller bottles, but went into 4x roller bottles instead due to a lack of working roller bottle apparatus' 
  * Meant to test different treatment feeding schedules (frequent: every 2-3 days, and reduced: every 3-4 days) but 3/4 flasks peeled early so this was not performed, instead final flask was just grown until peeling was observed.
