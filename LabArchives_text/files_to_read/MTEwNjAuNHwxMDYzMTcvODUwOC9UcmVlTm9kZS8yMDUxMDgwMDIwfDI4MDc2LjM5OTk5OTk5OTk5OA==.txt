Aim/Purpose


Background

Using the foundations built up during the "Buffalo Wings" prototype work, we
will trial tissue engineering at larger scales, using suspension adapted cells
(Nuvonis fibroblasts predominantly) and monitor the tissue development over
time (4-16 days). This work is part of the Mini-Tissues workstream for the
Second Product, more can be read about this here. Initial Buffalo Wings
experimental plans and lab books can be found here.

Aim

To understand the tissue maturation time for tissue engineering in moulds
using suspension Nuvonis cells.

Hypothesis

Tissue-engineered tissues seeded with suspension Nuvonis cells will develop
similarly to those prepared with adherent cells, and will improve in
structural and textural complexity over time due to increased matrix
production and tissue maturation.


Methods and Experiment Layout


Brief Method

The method followed here will be very similar to the one used for the Buffalo
Wings prototype large scale harvest. Briefly, this method will use Nuvonis
cells, embedded in a tissue gel matrix consisting of defined ratios of:
Collagen I, 10x DMEM/F12, 0.1M Sodium Hydroxide and Matrigel. This allows the
formation of tissues via the process of tissue gelation, condensation and
self-assembly around 2 attachment points (Figure 1) - See Notion page for
summary of approach.

printed solid mould (white)

  

Experiment Layout

We will seed 4 plates containing tissue engineering moulds with 3 tissues
each, at a single cell density (5M cells per mL), and we will mature the
tissues for 4 different lengths of time (4, 8, 12, 16 days).

Before Starting

  * Calculate approximate cell requirements for experiment 1
    * = Approx 240 million cells for 4 plates at the 5M/mL
  * Calculate required cell densities and volumes of matrix ingredients for large can be found here: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1nAKlh6US6Xud95YGlDTkI4LHBWjzlAxnhmTym1P2bUw/edit#gid=561508067
    * Total volumes for experiment:
      * Collagen I = 19.5ml
      * 10x DMEM/F12 = 2.4ml
      * 0.1M NaOH = 2.9ml
      * Matrigel = 4.3ml
  * Autoclave 4x large Nylon scaffolds, forceps and mould weights 
  * Make up PDMS and spin coat plates (DONE)
  * Ensure matrix reagents are made up fresh at required concentrations

Matrix reagents details for this experiment:

  * Make up matrix reagents:
    * Collagen I to 2.6mg/mL - stock is at 6.17mg/mL - dilution factor 1:2.4
      * need ~ 2 mL total (make 2.5 mL)
