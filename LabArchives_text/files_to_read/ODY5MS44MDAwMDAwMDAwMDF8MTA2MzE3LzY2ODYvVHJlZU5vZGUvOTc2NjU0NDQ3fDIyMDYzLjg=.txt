### Process:

1\. Aliquotted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then
placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath for a minimum of 20 minutes
prior to use:

  1. TrypLE:    40   mL in    1x 50mL   tubes
  2.  dPBS (for neutralising):    40  mL
  3.  dPBS (for washing):     40    mL
  4. Growth media (for seeding):    240  mL 

Time that all aliquots were placed in the water bath the warm before use
16:28  

Note: if aliquots were placed in water bath at different time, record the time
stamp for each individual solution.




4\. Removed vessel(s) from the incubator  16:40

5\. Washed the vessel(s) with dPBS (warmed).

6\. Added   10 mL tryple to each vessel/well and incubated at 37˚C.

  1. Start/Finish for TrypLE was   16:49 - 17:05   

7\. Neutralised with   10  dPBS and combined cell suspension into a    1 X
50mL   tube.

8\. Centrifuged at 650 x g for 5 min.

  1. Start/Finish time for centrifugation was   16:40 - 16:45    




9\. Aspirated the supernatant(s).

10\. Resuspended pellet(s) in  120 mL   Growth   media  17:10  

11\. Transferred cell suspension into 2 x un-coated T75 flask. Leave at 37C in
incubator for 45 mins  17:19 \- 18:04  

12\. After 45 minutes, transfer supernatant into 4 x gelatin-coated T75 flask.
Allow to sit at RT for 30 mins to allow cells to settle   18:08 - 18:38  




9\. Aspirated the supernatant(s).

10\. Resuspended pellet(s) in    3  mL     Growth     media   17:10

11\. Aliquoted       10ul   of resuspended cells into a microcentrifuge tube
for cell count.

12\. Performed a cell count using the haemocytometer and recorded the cell
count data in the Google Doc spreadsheet: Cell Count Spreadsheet or cell count
widget below.

Record the cell total in the KUZCO20 doublings calculator to track doubling
changes over time.

  1. Total cell number was:       11,700,000    

  2. Volume of cell suspension required for subculture was:      3mL (total cell suspension)   

  3. Cell density per vessel:    ~~  7000/cm^2~~  6857 cells/cm^2    

  

To seed for adipogenic differentiation experiment:

1\. Added 684,000 (881uL of resuspended cells) cells into 9mL of pre-warmed
Growth Media.  
Seeded at 20,000 cells / cm2. Each well of 24-well plate is 1.9cm2.

2\. Seeded 0.5mL/well into 18 x wells of 1 x 24-well plate (not gelatin
coated).

3\. Allowed plate to rest in BSC for 15 mins at RT `15:15 - 15:30 pm`

  

  




13\. Transferred    remaining µl of cell suspension to the pre-warmed     600
mL Growth media:    15:22 pm  

14\. Transferred cell suspension into the      4CF    vessel.

16\. Transferred vessel(s) to incubate at: 15:45  pm  

  * [ X]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (avian cells)
