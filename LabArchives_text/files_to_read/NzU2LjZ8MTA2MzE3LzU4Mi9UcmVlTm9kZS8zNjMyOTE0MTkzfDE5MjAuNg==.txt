Key result

The aim of this experiment was to construct an assembly with a culture surface
area of >100 cm2 that is capable of keeping cells alive (on scaffolds) while
also minimizing manual maintenance (media changes). With the suggested
prototypes, cells can be kept alive and sterile for prolonged periods of time
in a bioreactor 100x the size of a 6-well plate well. The figure below shows
MTT stained Alginate hydrogels cultured inside the bioreactor (left) vs a
6-well plate (right).

Discussion

  1. Cells can be kept alive in a large volume bioreactor without adding perfusion. 
  2. At the hardware-directed volumes of media, changes do not have to be performed for the tested number of scaffolds due to the high media excess. 
  3. Cells were incubated in Growth media for 1-2 days, followed by a media change to E6 diff media for 4 days. At both time points, MTT results for cell viability indicated cell survival was equivalent to the traditional 6-well plate controls.
  4. Sterility was maintained inside the bioreactor even after the prolonged periods of incubation at 37C as assessed visually (no suitable microscope objective to monitor bacterial growth available)

Limitations

Sterility was assessed to be sufficiently maintained by the fact that there
were no obvious deposits or cloudiness/discoloration effects observed in the
media

Conclusion

The static type reactor built in this study is suitable for handoff to
production and will save significant operator time by enabling the team to
process a large number of individual samples in one pot with minimal operator
interaction.

Future directions

The static type reactor is merely an intermediate step en route to a fully
closed systems with automated media changes and system monitoring (perfusion
reactor). As a next step and to further increase the benefit to production, a
perfusion system shall be built and the effect of large scale culture in
muscle maturation will be studied.
