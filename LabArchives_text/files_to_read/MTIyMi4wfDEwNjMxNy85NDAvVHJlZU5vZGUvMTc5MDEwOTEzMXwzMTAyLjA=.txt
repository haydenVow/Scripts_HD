NOTE: 2CFs were mistakenly given a half feed instead of a full feed. Once I
realised, I repeated the half feed process so they effectively received a 75%
change instead of a 100% feed.




Perform feed using below volumes:

Growth Media:

  * [x]  10C

Total media required: 1800 mL (300 mL per 2CF)




Reagent preparation

1\. Aliquoted 1800 mL of  10C Media into 2 x 1 L bottles. Placed in water bath
16:25  




Process

  1. Unscrewed white cap and remove blue cap and place aside.
  2. Removed  100 % of supernatant (300 mL) from 1 x 2CF by carefully pouring into a waste container with 300 mL marked.
  3. Replaced with  300 mL (per flask) of growth (10C) media by carefully pouring media through the white cap opening (alternatively you may use a 50mL serological to add media.)
  4. Place caps back and equalise 2CF by placing it on its side (blue cap on the bottom and white cap on the top, see image below:)  
  

4\. Returned vessel to incubate at:

  * [x]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (aviary cells)

  

  * [x]  Thermo Incubator (ID #13)
  * [ ]  Top Sanyo Incubator (ID #25)
  * [ ]  Bottom Sanyo Incubator
  * [ ]  Top Binder Incubator
  * [ ]  Bottom Binder Incubator
