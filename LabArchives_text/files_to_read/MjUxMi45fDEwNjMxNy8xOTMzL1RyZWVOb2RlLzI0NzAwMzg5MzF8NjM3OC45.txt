  

Screening of fibroblast cell sheets as scaffolds:

  

Overview:

2 sheet types, freeze-thawed and dried, seeded with 2 seeding densities (0.8M
or 1.5M cells/scaffold) in either a pre-wetted or dried state.

  

D-1 Prep day (Mon 21st)

1\. Pick 2 conditions from EPIC19190 Fibroblast sheet optimsation (whichever
conditions result in the thickest sheets)

2\.  Freeze-thaw all samples in petri dishes (Xing et al., 2015)

''place in a −80°C freezer for 30 min and thaw in 37°C PBS and rinse with PBS.
Repeat three times. Then rinse in DMEM at room temperature 2x' for 15mins each
and leave in media until ready to seed'

3\.  Remove media then leave samples to dry in the BSC over night  

  

D0 Seeding day (Tues 22nd)

1\. With sterile scissors and tweezers cut sheets into scaffolds (min 60, 96wp
size pieces) and place into a 48wp (no inserts), follow plate map below  
2\. To the 'wet' samples add seeding media (ACF or serum depending on sample
set) add enough to cover samples with media (leave wet for atleast 1h prior to
removing media immediately before seeding), leave the other half of samples
dry until seeding.

3\. Add 60ul of cell suspension of the correct cell density (0.8M
cells/scaffold or 1.5M cells/scaffold in the relevant media ACF or serum) to
each sample and leave plate in the BSC for 30 minutes to allow cells to adhere

4\. Gently (aspirate onto side of the well not directly onto the scaffold) add
1ml of relevant media to each well then place the plate in the incubator
(37'C, 5% CO2)

  

D1 Sampling day (Weds 23rd)

- CMFDA stain all samples > image > return plate to the incubator

\- Move samples into new 48wp with inserts containing pre-warmed relevant
PROLIFERATION media (ACF or serum, see plate map)

\- Calculate seeding efficiencies for the different conditions (tryplisation
of old wells > cell count)

D2 100% media change with E6 (D0 DIFF)  

D1 DIFF 100% media change with E6  
D2 DIFF 100% media change with E6  
D3 DIFF 100% media change with E6

D4 DIFF 100% media change with E6

D5 DIFF 100% media change with E6

D6 DIFF 100% media change with E6

D7 Sampling day

Move samples into new 48wp (no inserts for imaging)

CMFDA stain all samples > image

D7 DIFF 100% media change with E6

Return samples to 48wp with inserts > return plate to the incubator

D8 DIFF 100% media change with E6

D9 DIFF 100% media change with E6

D10 DIFF 100% media change with E6

D11 DIFF 100% media change with E6

D12 DIFF 100% media change with E6

D13 DIFF 100% media change with E6

D14 Sampling day

Move samples into new 48wp (no inserts for imaging)

On some samples (exact number tbd) CMFDA stain > image

Fix the rest of samples and stain with Vimentin (use optimised protocol) and
MyoG/MF20

  

JMP Matrix:  

Number of replicates = 4 (each condition has N=4)

Total ACF cells required for seeding = 36.8 M = 40M with excess for error.
(32 samples)  

Total serum cells required for seeding = 12.8M = 14M with excess for error (16
samples)

\+ 8 cell-free control samples  

Serum control cells will all be seeded at a seeding density of 0.8M:

C1 W 0.8 X 4 = 3.2

C1 D 0.8 X 4 = 3.2

C2 W 0.8 X 4 = 3.2

C2 D 0.8 X 4 = 3.2
