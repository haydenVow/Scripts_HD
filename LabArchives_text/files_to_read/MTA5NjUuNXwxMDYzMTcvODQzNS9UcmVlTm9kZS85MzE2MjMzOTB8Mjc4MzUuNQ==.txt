## Aim:

To create a sacrificial scaffold using food-grade 4% Alginate (Alg) submerged
throughout  Aeroplane jelly (placeholder gel matrix).

## Hypothesis:

Hypothesis: After embedding cross-linked alginate strands inside aeroplane
jelly and allowing it to set, and then submerging the gel to de-crosslink in
sodium citrate solution (soln) we hypothesise the de-crosslinking agent will
allow the alginate to dissolve into the solution and consequently create
channels throughout the aeroplane jelly.

## Methods

  1. 4% alginate (food grade) was created by mixing with tap water and sporadically heating in the microwave to ensure complete dissolving of the powder. 
  2. The alginate was extruded using 10mL and 50mL syringes with a 20 gauge (blunt) needle tip. 
  3. The alginate was crosslinked (with 200mM CaCl2 solution) in various extrusion techniques, which are listed in the table below. 
  4. The macroscope observations were recorded below.

31 May 2022#11\. Extrude Alg into a CaCl2 Soln bath  
2\. Place in silicone mould using forceps.  
3\. Fill the mould by our in jellly [1/4]  
4\. Allow the jelly to set (4C) by observing the stiffness 2, and 24 hours
after creating.  
5\. Place the jelly matrix in a bath of a decrosslinking citrate solution and
observe the changes at 20minutes, 1 hour, and overnight.

  * The jelly did not set 2 hours after creation 
  * The jelly was set (but soft) 24 hours after creation
  * After slicing the jelly matrix with a knife we observed no channels inside in the cross-section of the jelly at any of the decrosslinking time points.

2\. De crosslink briefly with a de-crosslinking citrate soln.  
3\. Aspirate/ remove excess fluid within the mould with a syringe.  
4\. Fill the mould by pouring in jelly and allowing it to set for 24 hour.  
5\. Place the jelly matrix in a bath of a decrosslinking citrate solution and
observe the changes at 20minutes, 1 hour, and overnight.

  * The jelly was set (but soft) at the 24hour time point. 
  * There were no observable channels within the jelly matrix at any of the decrosslinking time points.

## Images

1\. Cross-sections of the alginate strands ([4%], which were then
decrosslinked overnight) embedded in a jelly matrix.  

2\. Cross-sections of the alginate strands ([4%], which were then
decrosslinked overnight) embedded in a jelly matrix.  

  

3\. The extrusion process. Alginate strands are being crosslinked by extruding
the 4% alginate gel into the silicone mould, which is filled with 200mM CaCl2
solution.

3\. The extrusion process. 3x moulds filled with alginate strands were briefly
de-crosslinked (CaCl2 solution, 200mM) before pouring in the red areophane
jelly to set overnight (4C).

4\. Image of the jelly matrix formations (with alginate strands) floating in a
a solution of CalCl2 (200mM) to decrosslink the alginate strands embedded
within the jelly.

5\. Image of the jelly matrix formations (with alginate strands) floating in a
a solution of CalCl2 (200mM) to decrosslink the alginate strands embedded
within the jelly. We can see the central jelly (suspended in the solution) has
opaque alginate strands clumped together.

  

  




## Results/ Outcomes

From this investigation we found this technique of embedding alginate strands
inside a jelly matrix failed to adequately de-crosslink the alginate strands
and create channels throughout the matrix. Thus, this technique does not show
promising signs of being a viable approach to creating a sacrificial
'negative' scaffold and would need to optimised to establish a technique that
creates channels throughout the gel matrix.
