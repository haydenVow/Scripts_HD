Aim/Purpose


To create a biomaterial that has the following features:

\- Printability / Able to be moulded or cast under cell compatible conditions
for cell encapsulation

\- Good diffusion of media and nutrients and for removal of metabolic waste

\- Stable in aqueous solutions and at cell culture temperatures

\- Good taste and texture, especially post cell culture

\- Cell compatible and promotes cell adhesion (for cell adhesion) or promotes
cell spreading (for cell encapsulation)

\- Non-animal origin (preferably allergen free)


Hypothesis


To achieve the development of a biomaterial that meets all of our needs, a
hybrid hydrogel may need to be created, so that we can leverage the individual
components properties properly.


Technical Gap


The largest gap in our knowledge is how different biomaterials interplay when
combined to effect material characteristics such as cell compatibility,
rheology, structural stability, texture and taste. In addition, biofabrication
facilities/equipment will need to be developed to assist in ease of producing
scaffolds on a large regular scale. Furthermore, we do not know how the cells
will interact with the scaffolds until we seed.
