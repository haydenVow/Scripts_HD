Process:

  1. Zaber scanned 96 wp on phase (5x, exposure: 4x, main lab Zaber). 
  2. Prepared OT2 protocols and deck for a passage before commencing staining (see next lab book entry).
  3. Prepared 3 mL of 212.5 uL/mL of sterile Hoechst in PBS solution using 'new' Hoechst (stock ID: 3722 )
  4. Added 20uL/well of staining solutions to wells as follows:
    1. The blue shaded wells in columns  5 to 10. Blue shaded wells in column 1 to 4 were stained during the first passage and will not be stained for this passage.
    2.   5. Incubated plate at room temp in BSC in the dark 16:00 - 16:20
  6. Imaged all stained wells, as well as unstained wells  
    1. 5x, main lab Zaber (all)
    2. Phase: exposure 4, illuminator lamp: ~1
    3. DAPI whole well: exposure 100, illuminator lamp: 35
    4. DAPI center of well: same settings as above
  7. Returned plate to incubator 
    1. 37 degrees, 5% CO2, ID #52




Observations/Summary:

Stained wells with ~17uL/mL of Hoechst and imaged them.

Results will be determined after image analysis.
