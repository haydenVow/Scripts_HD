Took samples

  1. Unscrewed the "BENCHMARK" sample tube cover.
  2. Sprayed down the tube end with 70% ethanol.
  3. Connecedt a 5 mL sterile syringe.
  4. Withdrew slightly more than 3 mL (to purge the line).
  5. Discarded the 5 mL syringe.
  6. Connected a fresh sterile syringe and withdrew 3.5 - 4.0 mL of sample.
  7. Disconnected sample syringe and transferred 1 mL of sample each to 3 x 1.5 mL Eppendorf tubes for subsequent analysis.
  8. Sprayed sample tube end and cap with 70% ethanol, re-attached cap.

Notes

Note: user error - forgot to turn BASE-T pump back onto automatic mode after
re-priming line yesterday during draw and fill. The base bottle line had to be
removed from the pump in order to move the bioreactor closer to the BSC. Base
bottle line reattached to pump. pH on automatic mode but pump set to manual
off. Switched BASE-T pump back on again at 13:52

Online:

  * Temp: 37degC
  * dO: 80.5%
  * pH: 
    * 7.16 at 13:50
    * 7.41 at 13:53
  * Stir: 237-238 RPM

Offline:

  * pH: 
  * cell count manual: 276 000/mL
  * cell count ViCell: ViCell error, not currently operational

See cell counting spreadsheet for count calculations  
  
  
  




### Observations/Summary:

  * ### cell morphology appears healthy despite pH drop

  * ### cell count almost doubled since yesterday - likely cells will be ready for harvest on Monday 1st August
