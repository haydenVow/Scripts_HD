Reagent preparation:

2\. Centrifuged the secondary antibody stock using the benchtop
microcentrifuge for 10 seconds.

3\. Prepared Secondary Antibody mix (pipette from the top/supernatant of
antibody solution):

  1.6 µL   Secondary #1   (1:1000  ) +  1.6 µL   Secondary #2   (1:1000  ) +
1.6  mL Blocking Buffer (PBST (0.1% Triton X + dPBS) + 3% BSA)  

If using AlexaFluor secondary antibodies then the max concentration should be
1:500 (typically used at 1:1000)

Pipette-mixed antibody mix and stored refrigerated away from light until
needed.

4\. Prepared DAPI mix:

  1.6 mL  PBS +    1.6 uL  of DAPI

Vortexed DAPI mix and stored refrigerated away from light until needed.

Process:

1\. Removed plate from fridge (incubated in primary antibodies overnight).

2\. Washed 3 times for 5 min with PBS at RT.

 15:05 - 15:10 pm

 15:10 - 15:15 pm

 15:15 - 15:20 pm

3\. Incubated the cells with secondary antibody mixture in the dark at RT for
1 hour.  15:20 - 16:20 pm

NOTE: from this step onwards protect from the light by wrapping plates in foil
and perform experiment in the dark.




Counter staining

1\.  Removed 2nd antibody solution.  16:22 pm

2\.  Washed with DAPI (1:1000) in PBS for 5 min at RT in the dark.

 16:25 - 16:30 pm

3\.  Washed in PBS 3 x 5 min at RT in the dark. (No Triton)

 16:30 - 16:35 pm

 16:35 - 16:40 pm

4\.  Replaced dPBS.

 16:40 a/pm

5\. Confirmed staining on microscope by imaging.
