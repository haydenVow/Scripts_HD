  2. Obtained 0.2 mL PCR tubes
  3. Added 25μl of respective primer MM to each sample tube as per the table above
  4. Added 5μl  DNA extract to each tube according to the table below to make a total reaction volume of 30uL.

  1. Took samples to the PCR machine and set the settings to (melting temp for primers used was 61 degress C).  

13/4/22 - Running Gel electrophoresis.

  1. To visualize PCR products, made up a 1 % agarose gel in 0.5X TBE buffer (1 tablet + 50mL of 0.5X TBE). 
    1. The following tutorial was followed for setting up the gel electrophoresis station on the BentoLab https://bento.bio/protocol/biotechnology-101/introduction-to-gel-electrophoresis/
  2. Ran the PCR products on the gel using 2uL of loading dye mixed with 5uL of PCR product. Loading order listed below 
    1. Lane 1- Ladder
    2. Z+D, D5
    3. Z+D, D4
    4. Z+D, C1
    5. Z+D, C3
