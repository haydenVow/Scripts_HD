MICRO Carrier Preparation Protocol
  
  
Materials and Equipment Required

  1. Microcarriers
  2. Siliconized Schott Bottles
  3. Cell culture medium
  4. Sterile PBS (without Ca and Mg)
  5. Pluronic F-127

General Protocol

PBS with Pluronic F127 Preparation

  1. In a sterile container, mix Pluronic F127 with PBS to a final concentration of 5% (w/v).
  2. Stir on a low spin speed using a autoclaved magnetic stir bar at room temperature until the Pluronic F127 had dissolved.
  3. Sterile filter the pluronic solution into a sterile container inside the BSC using a syringe with a 0.22 micron filter.

Culture Medium (with Pluronic F127) Preparation

  1. In a sterile container, mix Pluronic F127 with growth medium to a final concentration of 5% (w/v).
  2. Stir on a low spin speed using a autoclaved magnetic stir bar at room temperature until the Pluronic F127 had dissolved.
  3. Sterile filter the pluronic solution into a sterile container inside the BSC using a syringe with a 0.22 micron filter.

Microcarrier Hydration

  1. Weigh out 0.2 g of microcarrier into a siliconized schott bottle.
  2. Add 100mL PBS+Pluronic F127 to microcarriers to achieve a final concentration of 2g/L.
  3. Autoclave at 121Â°C for 20 minutes to hydrate microcarriers.
  4. Cool down to room temperature before use. 

Culture Medium Equilibration

  1. Pipette microcarrier solution up and down to create a homogenous solution.
  2. Pipette required aliquot into a centrifuge safe tube and centrifuge for 5 mins at 300g or alternatively let microcarriers settle .
  3. Remove PBS supernatant and replace with cell culture medium. Pipetting up and down to wash microcarriers.
  4. Place on rocker stage and rock to stir microcarrier solution for 10 mins.
  5. Centrifuge at 300g for 3 mins, remove supernatant and resuspend microcarriers to 16 mg/mL concentration in filtered 5% w/v Pluronic F127 in growth media .

Cell Seeding

  1. Pipette microcarrier solution up and down to create a homogenous solution, pipette required amount of microcarriers plus media into a 50 mL polypropylene centrifuge tube. Bring to incuabtion temperature.
  2. Trypsinise and harvest cells from culture vessels and seed (AT HIGHER DENSITY THAN NORMAL - To account for cell loss due to lack of attachment to a microcarrier) microcarrier solution at the appropriate density directly into 50 mL centrifuge tube.
  3. Pipette innoculum+carriers up down to thoroughly mix. 
  4. Pipette seeded microcarriers into an ultra low attachment plate at required concentration (ideally enough to coat surface of plate).
  5. Incubate on orbital shaking platform for 5 mins every 30 mins x 4.
  6. Static incubation until confluence is reached.

Workflow - Media Equilibration of Carriers


1\. Make a 5% w/v Pluronic F-127 + PBS solution

  * Required volume of PBS: 200ml
  * Required F127 mass: 10g
  * Actual F127 mass: 10.008g
  * Actual volume of PBS: 200 mL
  * PBS ID: 12361
  * PLURONIC F127 ID: 821

2\. Make a 5% w/v Pluronic F-127 + DMEM/F12 20%FBS solution

  * Required volume of media: 300ml
  * Required F127 mass: 15g
  * Actual F127 mass: 15.007g
  * Actual volume of media: 300 mL
  * MEDIA ID: 12412
  * PLURONIC F127 ID: 821

2\. Filter pluronic F127 solutiuons through 0.22 micron filter unit.

3\. Combine carriers with PBS+Pluronic F127 to a concentration of 2 mg/mL.
Autoclave at 121C for 20 mins.

3\. Transfer carriers to 50 mL tube, centrifuge at 500g for 5 mins.

4\. Remove supernatant, replace with 10 mL media+pluronic F127. Pipette up and
down thoroughly to wash carriers.

5\. Centrifuge at 500g for 5 mins. Remove supernatant and replace with
media+pluronic F127 to a carrier concentration of 8 mg/mL.

4\. Store at 4C until required.

5\. Heat to cell culture temperature before use. Ensure you pippette up and
down thoroughly before use to reconstitute any Pluronic F127 that has
precipitated out of solution
