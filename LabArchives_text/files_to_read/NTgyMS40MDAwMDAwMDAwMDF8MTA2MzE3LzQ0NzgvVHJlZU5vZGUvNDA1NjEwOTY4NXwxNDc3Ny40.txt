Process:

  1. Aliquotted   6 mL  mL of eachE6 and 2% HS Media 
  2. Placed in water bath   11:11 am 
  3. Remove media by using 4 pipette tips on the multichannel pipette (this fits perfectly in the 25ml urine container).
  4. Removed  100  % of supernatant from vessel for wells B3 to B10. 
  5. Replaced with  200 uL (per well) of  E6 media for wells B3 to B10.
  6. Repeat this for all remaining plates.
  7. Removed   50 % of supernatant from vessel for wells D3 to D10.
  8. Replaced with   100 uL (per well) of  E6 media for wells D3 to D10.
  9. Repeat this for all remaining plates.
  10. Removed  100  % of supernatant from vessel for wells C3 to C10.
  11. Replaced with  200 uL (per well) of  2% HS media for wells C3 to C10.
  12. Repeat this for all remaining plates.
  13. Removed   50 % of supernatant from vessel for wells E3 to E10.
  14. Replaced with   100 uL (per well) of  2% HS media for wells E3 to E10.
  15. Returned vessel to incubate at: 12:23 pm

  * [X]  37ºC @   12:23 pm, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (aviary cells)

  

  * Incubator (Sanyo #3 [120 Ralph street]), Lab [Main]




### Observations/Summary:

Cells in rows C and E (2% HS samples) in all plates appear to be either
completely detached or semi-detached from the surface of the culture vessel.

However, cells in wells F7-F10 appear to be differentiating well and are all
adhered (have not had their media changed for 96 hours).

This suggests 2% HS media + feeds are causing unexpected cell death. To be
investigated further

There is also some frosting of the plastic underneath wells in Row C of a few
of the plates. Wells will need to be assessed before IF staining to determine
which wells are suitable to stain. The frosting is similar to an arteface RS
has witness when polystyrene plastic and acetone come into contact, however we
will investigate further and try to determine what happened in this case.
