Took samples

  1. Sprayed down the sample line end with 70% ethanol.
  2. Connected a 5 mL sterile syringe.
  3. Withdrew 1 mL (to purge the line), discarded
  4. Connected a fresh sterile syringe and withdrew 1 mL of sample.
  5. Disconnected sample syringe and transferred 1 mL of sample each to 1.5 mL Eppendorf tube
  6. Sprayed sample line with 70% ethanol.
  7. streaked agar plate:
    * 1\. Prepare agar. (SOP in progress).   
2\. Spray petri dishes with 70% EtOH, wipe dry, and place into the BSC. For
each vial/sample being tested, use 2x petri dishes for duplicate testing.  
3\. Using a serological pipette, dispense 15mL agar onto each plate and allow
to sit for 30 minutes. Place the lid face down leaning on the petri dish and
on the bench.  
4\. Thaw 2 - 3 x vials as per standard operating procedure.  
5\. Meanwhile, take TSA plates (if not using in-house agar) from the fridge
and allow to reach room temperature. To speed up this process, place the
plates into the 30C or 37C incubator for up to 10 minutes to speed up this
process.  
6\. Once vials are thawed, spray thoroughly with 70% EtOH, wipe dry with a
rediwipe and place into the BSC on a cryovial stand.  
7\. Spray the cell spreader packet and petri dishes/TSA plate with 70%EtOH,
wipe dry, and place into the BSC.  
8\. Extract 100uL of sample from one of the vials and dispense at the centre
of the agar plate.  
9\. Using the cell spreader, spread the sample to cover the surface.  
5\. If making agar in house, pour the agar into the petri dish and allow to
stand for 30 minutes, then proceed to step 6. Otherwise, proceed to step 6.  
6\. Extract 100uL from the vial and dispense at the centre of the agar plate.  
7\. Take a cell spreader from the packet ensuring the spreader does not touch
the sides of the packaging.  
8\. Position the cell spreader handle at the centre of the petri dish with the
tip of the 'L' pointing towards the edge of the petri dish a 45 degree angle
and gently rotate the plate on the spot.  
9\. Repeat steps 6-8 for the duplicate plate.  
10\. Repeat steps 6-9 for remaining vials.  
11\. Label agar plates with the vial number, plate number out of total number,
date of sampling, and initials. "plate ID_nox_of_x_dd/mm/yyyy_INITIALS'  
12\. Incubate one plate at room temperature and the duplicate plate at 30C.  
13\. Observe for bacterial/fungal growth after 5-8days and record results.
