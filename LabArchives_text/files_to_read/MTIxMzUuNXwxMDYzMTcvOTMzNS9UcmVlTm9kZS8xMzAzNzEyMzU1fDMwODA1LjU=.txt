AIM/PURPOSE: To determine optimum Nuvonis cell densities for reliable
formation of tissue boxes.  
  
Why?  Given the initial findings from the Tissue Discs Experiment, the multi-
directional tension produce an undesirable internal tissue structure. We will
now begin trialling a design that facilitates unidirectional tension to
achieve a stronger internal structure and our desired texture.

HYPOTHESIS: 40M cells/mL will be the optimal density for producing the desired
tissue  
  
Why? Writing out the hypothesis will encourage you to ensure your experimental
design will allow you to support/disprove the hypothesis, and to ask yourself
questions such as: Is there sufficient replicates to ensure statistical
significance?
