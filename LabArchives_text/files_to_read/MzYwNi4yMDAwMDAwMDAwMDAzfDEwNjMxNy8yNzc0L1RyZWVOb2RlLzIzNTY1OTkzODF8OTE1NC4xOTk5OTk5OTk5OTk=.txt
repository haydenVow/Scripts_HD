  1. Day 0 - Revive MuSCs, seeding directly into 1 x 96-well plate at 1,000 cells / well  
Half plate + p38i  
Half plate - p38i

  2. Day 1 - 50% Feed all wells with respective media
  3. Day 3 - Fix all wells
  4. Primary Stain for MyoD/MyoG (to confirm myogenicity and also differentiation)
  5. Secondary Stain for AF488/555 (correlating to primary isotypes)
  6. Zaber image all stained wells for DAPI/AF488/AF555.
  7. Calculate % of MyoG+MyoD+ cells out of all DAPI+ cells for both conditions (Â±p38i)
  8. Generate graph and calculate statistics between 2 groups.
