Process:

7267-DOLLY12-Sheep P9-2of3 is in Thermo incubator.

  1. Stain with sterile filtered Hoechst (stock ID 2463) by adding 20uL/mL to each well. Because each well has 140uL/well of media, this would equal to 2.8uL/well of Hoechst.
    1. Note: only 18 wells need staining (column 2, 3, and 4 of the plate). Edge wells contain PBS only.
  2. Incubate for 10 min. Confirm staining on Axio. Incubate for 10 min more if needed. 15:34 - 15:54
    1. Cells were not stained even after 20 minutes. So fix + DAPI was performed.
  3. Wash wells twice with 150uL/well of PBS
  4. Fix cells for 15 minutes with 4% PFA (100uL/well) at room temp. 16:05-16:20
  5. Stain cells with DAPI (1:1000 in PBS) by adding 100uL/well and incubating for 5 min. 16:22-16:27
  6. Wash wells twice with 150uL/well of PBS for 5 minutes each.
  7. Image on the Zaber on 5x (one image per well).
  8. Parafilm plate and store in fridge (4 degrees C).

  




Observations/Summary:

Fixed and DAPI stained culture 7267. Imaged on Zaber (5x). Hoescht staining
the cells did not work.




Reagents used:

PFA: a3098

DAPI: m2193

PBS: m5385




SOPs used:

N/A




Results:

  * Results were;
    * [ ]  As Usual (this is a repetitive task)
    * [X]  Unexpected because... We expected live cells to stain with Hoechst 
    * [ ]  Need to be further analysed
    * [ ]  Other (.......)
