Aim/Purpose


To determine the suitability and muscle-specificity of phalloidin-iFluor-AF488
for f-actin (filamentous actin) staining of MuSCs, compared to MF20.


Hypothesis


That phalloidin-iFluor-AF488 will stain F-actin which is present in the
cytoskeleton of Muscle, and will show up where MF20 is present in
differentiated skeletal muscle in vitro.


Technical Gap


Relying on immunofluorescent MF20 (myosin heavy chain) staining as a marker
for maturation is time consuming (primary and secondary antibody steps), and
the stain for f-actin requires only a 20-90 minute incubation followed by a
few wash steps. If the phalloidin stain is suitable for marking areas of the
cells where MF20 is present (and potentially highlighting striations in mature
muscle), it could be a cheaper and more time effective stain for assessing
maturation, and can also be applied to other uses at Vow when f-actin needs to
be observed or quantified.


Method/Procedure


  1. [Experiment Plan/Peer-review]
    * Collect BUFFY6 and C2C12 plates from the Multiple species experiment that was run in CLI (cell loss investigation) - fixed on Day 10 of differentiation (2% HS and E6)  
Note* cells are already DAPI stained as of 24-NOV-21.

    * Permeabilise, Block and Primary stain all samples with mouse anti-MF20 primary antibody.
    * Wash and add anti-mouse AF555 secondary antibody + Phalloidin-iFluor-488 reagent and incubate for 90 minutes at RT.
    * Wash samples and Image on the Zaber imaging platform on DAPI/AF488/AF555.
    * Run images through ImageJ to merge and identify whether F-Actin and Myosin heavy chain are present in the same areas of the cultures.
    * Make observations as to the suitability of phalloidin staining for assessing maturation of muscle cells in vitro.
