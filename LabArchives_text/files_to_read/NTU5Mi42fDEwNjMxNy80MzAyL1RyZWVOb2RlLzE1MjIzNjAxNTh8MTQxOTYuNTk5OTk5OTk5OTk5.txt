Growth Media:

[x] DMEM/F12

[x] RPMI

[x] DMEM/F12 Boost

[x] RPMI Boost

For composition of each media refer to the media preparation lab book entry




Process:

  1. Prep growth media and place in water bath 11:15
  2. Collected 8 x 50 mL shake tubes from shaker
  3. Centrifuged tubes at 300 x g for 5 min.  DMEM/F12 + DMEM/F12 Boost tubes 11:19 - 11:24   RPMI + RPMI Boost tubes 13:05 - 13:10     

  4. Aspirated   4.5 mL (500 uL remaining)  of supernatant leaving 0.5 mL in the tube, taking extra care to not disrupt or aspirate pellet
  5. Gently pipette-mixed cultures and took 20 uL samples from each culture and stored in separate microtubes until ready to count
  6. Loaded 10 x samples onto haemocytometers and observed cells and performed cell counts
  7. Discarded cultures where no live cells were found
  8. Fed cultures with live cells remaining.  
  
  
Cell counts:

  9. 7929- 26,000
  10. 7933- 44,000

Cultures 7923, 7928, 7930, 7931, 7932, 7934 were discarded due to no viable
cells remaining. See image links above. 7929 and 7933 were resuspended in
fresh media and kept in culture. 7933 did have visible aggregates that were
difficult to break up.
