## Performed by: Chris and Jared  




Perform feed using below volumes:

  




Differentiation Media:

  * E6  
  
Total media required: 48 mL




Culture IDs to feed

Vessel type(s)Vessel ID  
12 well plate  
7513-DOLLY12-Sheep P12-1of2  
7514-DOLLY12-Sheep P12-2of2  
  
  
  




Process:

1\. Aliquoted  1x 48 mL  mL of  E6 Dif Media into  1x 50mL  tube(s). Labelled
aliquots with the feed date and 'EPIC21489'.  
Placed aliquots in media fridge 74 in main lab 15:00 03/08  

2\. Aliquots placed in water bath   10:05 - 10:35  

5\.  100% of supernatant from the vessel was removed.

6\. Replaced with  2mL (per well/per vessel) of  E6 Dif  media.

7\. Returned vessel to incubate    10:45  

  * [x]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (aviary cells)

  

  * [ ]  Thermo Incubator (ID #13)
  * [ ]  Top Sanyo Incubator (ID #25)
  * [x]  Bottom Sanyo Incubator (ID #80)  

  * [ ]  Top Binder Incubator
  * [ ]  Bottom Binder Incubator

## Imaging

Imaged both plates, taking whole well images of every well using the zaber
16:45  

For information on how to use the zaber, refer to:

ad19527eee9e42ed9db96faa911d6536

Tips for imaging the 12WP are to use 8x8 imaging sites in the HSC site
generator, remembering to change the spacing rule to field of view with 60 um
spacing. Remember to build the MM List in the HSC site generator and confirm
the number of images expected (usually >700) in the Mult-D Acq.




## Begin EStim Process:

Open Arduino (search in 'Activities'). This should open the previously used
script in the Micromanager, which should be 'stimjimPulser.ino'. If this
script does not open, it can be opened by heading to
Home>Arduino<stimjimPulser>stimjimPulser.ino and opening this file.

In the Arduino script, comments are denoted with two forward slashes --> //  
Code which runs operations on the StimJim microcontroller does not have these
forward slashes.

  

To run a test run of the stimulation

#### Uncomment the two lines of code, underneath the comment --> //check if
the pulseTrain is finished; if so, exit  
By using two forward slash keys --> //

Like so:  

Click Verify to check the code is still accepted and no mistakes have been
made:

Click Upload to upload the firmware onto the StimJim microcontroller.

####  

#### To run the stimulation non-stop

#### Comment out the two lines of code underneath the comment --> //check if
the pulseTrain is finished; if so, exit  
By using two forward slash keys --> //

Like so:  

Click Verify to check the code is still accepted and no mistakes have been
made:

Click Upload to upload the firmware onto the StimJim microcontroller.
