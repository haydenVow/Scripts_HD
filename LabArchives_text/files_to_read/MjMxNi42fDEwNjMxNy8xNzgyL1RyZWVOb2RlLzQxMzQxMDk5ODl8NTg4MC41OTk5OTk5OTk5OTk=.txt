Preparation:

  1. Spare growth media from Production was used. This included 750mL of Phenol-red containing Growth Media (10% FBS) and 750mL of PRF Growth Media (20% FBS). It was decided that in order to mimic our growth conditions as much as possible, 750mL of media containing 20% FBS would be used first and then topped up with 10% FBS containing media until desired volume for probe submersion was achieved.
  2. 750mL of each media type was ultimately used in the total 1.5L volume.
  3. All 1.5L of media was used to make total working volume of 1.5L inside Wash-E
  4. 15mL of media was removed and 15mL of P/S was added.
  5. Lid of Wash-E was closed and all probes attached.
  6. Medium was allowed to come to 37.4 degrees temperature.

Test parameters:

  1.  CO2 gas was sparged in at a flow rate of 20 (unknown units - to be followed up) and it was observed that at every 5 mins (approx) the initial DO reading of 2.34V steadily decreased - indicating that the system was perhaps not reaching equilibrium at a desired DO level at a particular flow rate, but rather the flow rate dictates how quickly the system acheives saturation.
  2.  It was decided that Tom would be a good person to consult on this, after consulting Tom explained that an equilibrium would be achieved.
