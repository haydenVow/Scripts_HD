Reagent preperation

1\. Aliquotted  150 mL  mL of  Growth Media. Placed in water bath   2:50 pm




Cell factory Process

  1. Unscrew white cap and remove blue cap and place aside.
  2. Removed  `50`  % of supernatant (150 mL) from 1 x 4CF by carefully pouring into a waste container with 150 mL marked.
  3. Replaced with  `300` mL (per flask) of  `growth`   media by carefully pouring media through the white cap opening (alternatively you may use a 50mL serological to add media.)
  4. Place caps back and equalise 4CF by placing it on its side (blue cap on the bottom and white cap on the top, see image below:)  
  

4\. Returned vessel to incubate at: 15:26
