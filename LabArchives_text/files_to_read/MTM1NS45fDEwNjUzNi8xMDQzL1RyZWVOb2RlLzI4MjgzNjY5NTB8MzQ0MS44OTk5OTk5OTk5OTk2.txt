Batch 01 CHO-S Overview

Batch weight: 83.7489g

Batch Objectives/Experimental Plan:

  * Generate at least 80g of CHO-S suspension cells in a single batch, based on the existing assumption that 19g of CHO-S cells can be produced per 1L of culture medium.
    * Based on the above assumption ~4.2L of culture medium is required to generate at least 80g of CHO-S cells.

Experimental Plan:

The original experimental plan for expanding CHO-S for the production batch
involved the following process:

  1. Initial thaw: 10 million CHO-S cells in 1x E125
  2. Passage 1:1x E125 into 2x E500
    1. Transfer culture media into suitable centrifugation vessel and spin
    2. Aspirate supernatant and resuspend cell pellet in fresh growth media
    3. Retrieve sample for cell counting
    4. Seed new vessels
  3. Passage 2: 2x E500 into 6x E2000
    1. Same process as step 2
  4. Harvest: 6x E2000
    1. Same process as step 2

Several changes were made to this process in response to the increased
workload that the production team were tasked with. In essence these changes
sought to reduce any intermediary steps that were not critical for this
process to be accomplished. Namely the pellet resuspension following
aspiration (i.e., step 2.2) and the cell count (i.e., step 2.3). The new
experimental plan involved the following process:

  1. Initial thaw: 10 million CHO-S cells in 1x E125
  2. Passage 1: 1x E125 into 2x E500
    1. Dilute cells into fresh media (no centrifugation or cell count) and immediately see new vessel/s
  3. Passage 2: 2x E500 into 6x E2000
    1. Same process as step 2
  4. Harvest: 6x E2000
    1. Transfer culture media with suspension cells into suitable centrifugation vessel and spin
    2.  Aspirate supernatant and resuspend cell pellet in fresh growth media. 
    3. Retrieve sample for cell counting
    4. Centrifuge tubes to pellet cells until cells are collected in a single vessel
    5. Weigh vessel with cells to determine batch weight

Notable Events:

  * A total of 40,275,800,000 (~40 billion) CHO-S cells were harvested from an initial seeding of 10 million and after 14 days in continuous culture
    * Total weight was 83.7489g, equating to a harvest yield of ~20 g/L
    * This equated to a density of 9,589,476 (~9.5 million) cells per mL of culture medium. According to the literature this appears to be close to the upper limit that growth media can support with CHO-S cells
  * The cells exhibited a total of 11.98 doublings and a doubling time of 28.06 hours
  * Following the initial centrifugation step (500 x g) to pellet the cells, the aspirated supernatant appeared cloudy, and a sample observed under the microscope revealed a significant number of cells were not pelleted during the centrifugation spin
    * As a result the cells were spun again at a speed of 3000 RPM to pellet the remaining cells
    * A second sample revealed that there were still CHO-S remaining in the aspirated supernatant following the second spin however it appeared to be only a marginal amount compared to the sample retrieved from the first centrifugation
      * An alternative method may be required to harvest the CHO-S cells from the growth medium - potentially size filtering
  * CHO-S cells were grown in a quarter of the recommended concentration of L-Glutamine/Glutamax (2mM instead of 8mM)
  * The cells were in culture and harvested during the contamination-gate incident (see post mortem) during the month of January 2022
    * Samples taken from each of the 2L E-flask cultures and observed directly on a microscope revealed no obvious signs of contamination
      * An agar streak plate was prepared with samples from the cultures which after 7 days of incubation revealed no contamination. Therefore this indicated that it was likely the cultures were not contaminated with any microbes (fungal, bacteria or yeast)

Achievements:

  * This represents the first successful production style batch of CHO-S, in which ~84g of cell mass was obtained from approximately 4.2L of culture media
  * This batch confirmed that the CHO-S can be diluted directly into fresh culture media instead of centrifuging and resuspending completely in fresh media. See outline and rationale in the experimental plan above
  * Additionally, no contamination was detected during the contamination-gate incident, despite these cultures not containing any pen-strep
