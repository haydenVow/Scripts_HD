### Process:

1\. Took image of vessel with microscope on phase setting. Include link in
image section

2\. Gelatin coated     1     x    4CF       and 2 x 2CF  vessel  with sterile
filtered 0.1% gelatin solution and then incubated all coated flasks at 37ËšC.

  1. Time when all vessels(s) placed into the incubator       10:45   am 

  

Media prep and passage followed the following lab book: https://au-
mynotebook.labarchives.com/share/Vow%2520-%2520Team%2520Science/NjAzNS45MDAwMDAwMDAwMDF8MTA2MzE3LzQ2NDMtMzgwNTIvVHJlZU5vZGUvMjAwODYzOTU3NXwxNTMyMS45

  




Observations/Summary:

Did not obtain enough cells in the from passage, therefore preformed another
thaw to get enough cells for expansion. Combined both passage cells with
thawed cells.
