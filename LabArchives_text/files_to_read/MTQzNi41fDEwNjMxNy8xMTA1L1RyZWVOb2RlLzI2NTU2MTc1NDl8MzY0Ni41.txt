1\. Prepared   5 mL  PBST (0.2% Triton-X)

2\. Prepared    10 mL  blocking buffer: PBST (0.1% Triton-X + PBS) + 3% bovine
serum albumin (BSA). (Kept in the fridge until needed in blocking step)

3\. Prepared Primary Antibody Mix: 25  µL   Primary #1 MyoG (Santa Cruz)
(1:200  ) +  100 µL   Primary #2 MF20 (DSHB)   (1:50  ) +  5  mL Blocking
Buffer

Vortexed antibody mix for 5 seconds and stored refrigerated away from light
until needed.

  

4. Prepared Secondary Antibody Mix: 5  µL   Secondary Goat Anti-Mouse (IgG2b)    (1:1000  ) +  5 µL   Secondary Goat Anti-Mouse (IgG1)    (1:1000  ) +  5  mL Blocking Buffer 

5\. Prepare 5 ul DAPI in 5 mL PBS

Process:

Fixing

1\. Remove media from each well

2\. Wash with PBS three times

3\. Fix with PFA for 15 minutes  11:07 - 11:22 am

4\. Wash with PBS three times

  

Permeabilise

1\. Removed PBS from each well.

2\. Added  100 µL PBST (0.2% Triton-X) to each well for 15 min:  11:33 - 11:48
am

3\. Aspirated PBST for each well.




Blocking

1\. Added  100 µL of blocking buffer (3% BSA in PBST [0.1% Triton-X]) and
incubate for 45 minutes - 1hr at RT. (no more than 1 hour):   11:51 - 12:50 pm




Single/Simultaneous Primary Antibody staining

1\. Removed blocking buffer from each well.

2\. Incubated cells with primary antibody for 90min - 2hrs at RT, or 4ºC
overnight:   12:55 - 2:30 pm

3\. Parafilmed plates and stored at 4ºC in tissue culture lab Fridge.

After this step, all further task should be performed in a dark room. The
vessel should also be wrapped foil when not used.




Secondary

Process:

1\. Removed plate from fridge (incubated in primary antibodies overnight).

2\. Washed 3 times for 5 min with PBS at RT.

 2:30 - 2:35 pm

 2:35 - 2:40 pm

 2:40 - 2:45 pm

3\. Incubated the cells with secondary antibody mixture in the dark at RT for
1 hour.  14:45 - 15:45 pm

NOTE: from this step onwards protect from the light by wrapping plates in foil
and perform experiment in the dark.

Counter staining

1\.  Removed 2nd antibody solution.  15:45 pm

2\.  Washed with DAPI (1:1000) in PBS for 5 min at RT in the dark.

 15:45 - 15:50 pm

3\.  Washed in PBS 3 x 5 min at RT in the dark. (No Triton)

 15:51 - 15:56pm

 15:56 - 16:02 pm

4\.  Replaced dPBS.

 16:04 pm

5\. Confirmed staining on microscope by imaging.
