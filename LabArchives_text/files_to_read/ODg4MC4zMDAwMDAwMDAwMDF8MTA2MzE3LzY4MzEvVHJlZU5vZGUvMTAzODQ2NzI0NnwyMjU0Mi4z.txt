Haemocytometer counts

  1. Take 1 x 10 uL sample from each replicate well 
  2. Perform cell counts and calculate average. Enter into table below along with any comments (e.g. excessive cell death, debris etc.)

>95% alive, look normal and happy, saw multiple doublets suggesting they are
multiplying.  
  
Ave count suggests they have increased by ~40%, which is in-line with their
24H doubling rate given they were seeded at 10K per well at around 5 pm last
night

ML model counts

  1. Image ULA 96-wp on Zaber on Phase (5x) 
  2.  ~~Take 1 x 100 uL sample from each well replicate of the 96-dwp and transfer into a regular 96-wp  ~~
  3. Image 96-wp on Zaber on Phase (5x) 
  4. Run images through ML model 
  5. Enter average count from ML model results into table below along with any comments (e.g. excessive cell death, debris etc.)
