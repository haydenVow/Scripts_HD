Perform Feed

Feed not performed (not required)  

  1.  ~~Prepared media as per  ~~ ~~media calculator~~
  2.  ~~added    uL  EGF and    uL IGF to media in specimen jar~~
  3.  ~~Incubated in water bath for ~20 mins. Incubated from  ~~
  4.  ~~Filter-sterilised media using syringe and filter unit directly into E-flask. 40mL per flask~~
  5.  ~~Returned flask to incubation~~

Observations:

  * cells have not increased in density since thaw
  * cells are unhealthy in morphology
  * NOTE: was advised that thaw into low attachment T-flask as per nuvonis protocol was not required however, in this instance, this may have contributed to poor viability of cells following thaw
  * actions:
    * will discard these unhealthy cultures
    * will perform another thaw as per Nuvonis standard SOP
    * will thaw into Freestyle medium and switch out to HyCell formulation to ensure viability of cells
