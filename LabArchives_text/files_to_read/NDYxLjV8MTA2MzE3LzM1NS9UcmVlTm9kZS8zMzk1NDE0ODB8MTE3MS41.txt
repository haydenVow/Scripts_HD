Reactor: Bake dish with flour sieve and pizza lid (BOB)

Start date: 20/04/21

Operator: CO, JB

Reactor preparation:

  1. v1 assembly was wrapped in aluminum foil and dry-autoclaved at 120C for 15 min
  2.  Afterwards, the assembly was placed on the lab bench to dry (still wrapped in foil)
  3.  V1 was ethanol-sprayed and transferred into the BSC and unwrapped

Scaffold preparation:

  1. 96w sized Zein pieces in DMEM were soaked in 2.5%w/v Epsilon-polylysine (in PBS)  (start 11:00-12:30) and dried in the BSC until seeding
  2. 4% sterile Alginate (Mix 3499) and 75mM CaCL2 (Mix 3498) were equilibrated to room temperature and transferred into the BSC until seeding

Scaffold seeding:

  1. 50M cells from production batch 008 (Culture IDs 6385, 6386, 6387, 6388) were spun down into a concentrated pellet and resuspended into 1 mL
  2. Zein:
    1. 1M cells per Zein piece (16 pieces + 4 cell free) were seeded with 20 uL of concentrated suspension and left to adhere for 15 min 13:05
    2. Half of the scaffolds were placed inside the bioreactor cells facing up where possible
    3. The other 8 (+2 controls) were placed into a 24w dish as control
  3. Alginate:
    1. The remaining cells (30M) were encapsulated in 4% alginate as follows
    2. 2 mL Alginate + 0.6 mL cell suspension and 1.4 mL warm growth media were combined 
    3. 4 samples were dispensed in 4 portions of 500 uL each into a 24w plate
    4. 75 mM Calcium (2 mL) was added for 10 min (13:10)
    5. the gels were washed with media 3x 13:25, 13:30, 13:40
    6. 2 alginates each were placed into the bioreactor or the 24w dish
  4. 300mL growth media was added to the bioreactor, ensuring that all scaffolds were covered with media
  5. 2 mL growth media was also added to each well of the 24w plate

Culture IDs:

6440-DOLLY12-Sheep P12-1of2 (24w plate)  
6441-DOLLY12-Sheep P12-2of2 (reactor, 300 mL)
