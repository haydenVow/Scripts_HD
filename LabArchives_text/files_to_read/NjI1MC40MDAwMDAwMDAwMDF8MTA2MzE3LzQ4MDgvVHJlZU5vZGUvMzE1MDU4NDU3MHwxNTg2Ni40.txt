Growth Media (CD-CHO + 10% KSR without P/S)m7683  
  
  

  




Process:

  1. OT2 setup time: ~10 min
  2. During the first attempt of the growth media run, I noticed a mistake in the protocol. When fresh growth media is dispensed, the 'mix' checkbox was ticked so the culture was being mixed every time 1 mL or 0.5 mL of media was added. Instead we want it to mix after all 2.5 mL of fresh media has been added. Stopped run when this was observed for well A1.
  3.   4. Fixed protocol and started another run. This time, I did not include a tip in the 'A1' position of the tiprack. This was done to avoid the OT2 from doing a feed on well A1, but still make the movements required for it so that we can time how long an entire 24 dwp requires.
    1. start time: 10:14:05 AM
    2. run time: 42:27 minutes
  5. Covered 24 dwp with a new cover and stored in the incubator at 37 degrees C, 5% CO2. (#118)

  




Observations/Summary:

A growth media run to feed and sample an entire 24 dwp for performed. Plate
was placed in the incubator so that we can check sterility of the media later.

The protocol took 42:27 minutes
