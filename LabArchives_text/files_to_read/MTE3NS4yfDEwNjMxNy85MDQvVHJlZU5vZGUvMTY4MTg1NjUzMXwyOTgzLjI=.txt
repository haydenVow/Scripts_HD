### Process:

1\. Took image of vessel with microscope on phase setting.

2\. Aliquotted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then
placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath for a minimum of 20 minutes
prior to use:

  1. TrypLE:   600  mL 
  2.  dPBS (for washing and neutralising):    1200   mL 
  3. Growth media (for pellet resuspension/cell count):   30  mL 
  4. Growth media 10C (for seeding scaffolds):    12880 uL + error = 15 mL  (56 wells seeded with 10C)
  5. Growth media D/F+20%FBS+1xP/S+P38i (for seeding control scaffolds):  3680 uL + error = 4.5 mL  (16 wells seeded with serum-media) 

Note: if aliquots were placed in water bath at different time, record the time
stamp for each individual solution.
