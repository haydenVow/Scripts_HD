The intention of this experiment is to verify the findings observed in the
previous biomaterials DSD experiment (see EPIC16070 Day 1 results). This
experiment will investigate the effects of E6 + ECM media conditions 11, 3, 1,
5 against ACF (E6) on cell confluennce on zein scaffolds with or without EPL
coating. The composition of the different media conditions are shown below.  
  
The experiment is to be comprised of 10 conditions, with n=6 replicates and a
total of 60 samples  
The seeding density will be of 0.8M cells/scaffold= at least 50M cells needed

(NOTE - This had to be reduced to 0.7M due to low ACF cell harvest)

Media and cell requirement calculations

Cells

(14 conditions * 6 reps) * 0.8 M = 67.2 M cells + error = ~70M cells (9.6M of
these will be grown in serum-media)

E6 Media

6 reps x 14 days x 14 conditions + error = 1300 mL
