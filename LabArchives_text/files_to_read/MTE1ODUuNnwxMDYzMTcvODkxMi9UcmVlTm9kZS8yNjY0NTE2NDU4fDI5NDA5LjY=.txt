Process
  
  
  1. Added 30 mL of 50/50 RPMI/CHO Nuvonis suspension media + GFs (with added glucose, ala-gln, and HT) to 24 x E125s
  2. Added 30 mL of 50/50 RPMI/CHO Nuvonis suspension media + GFs (with added glucose, ala-gln, and without HT) to 4 x E125s
  3. Placed all E125s in shaking incubator to warm and equilibrate media 11:10 - 12:15
  4. While media was warming, printed labels for flasks
  5. Received 178.3 mL of cell suspension from EPIC31425 containing 180M cells 
  6. Centrifuged at 500 x g for 5 min 
  7. Aspirated 100% of supernatant (moved 5 mL supernatant to 1 x T25 and kept in incubator as contamination check - see lab book here for explanation)
  8. Re-suspended in 15 mL of 50/50 RPMI/CHO Nuvonis suspension media + GFs (no additives)
  9. Retrieved flasks from incubator and brought into BSC 8-10 at a time
  10. Added 500 uL of cell suspension to each flask (6M cells per flask, 200K cells/mL)
  11. Added labels to each flask
  12. Replaced flasks in incubator (37'C, 5% CO2, 120 RPM) 


Glucose test strip "calibration"

  1. Prepared 9 x solutions of glucose at 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 g/L concentration in MilliQ water
  2. Dipped glucose test strips into each solution simultaneously, then pulled out and took an image of the test strips next to each other 
  3. Studied strips by eye and recorded observations
  4. Discarded solutions
