Performed by: KK  




Process

1\. Each of the cultures listed in the table bellow has 1 well filled. Image
each culture on 10x magnification, then 50% feed cultures 7725 and 7871 and
passage culture 7722 and 7724.

### Process:

1\. Took image of vessel with microscope on phase setting.

3\. Aliquoted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then
placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath for a minimum of 20 minutes
prior to use:

For feeds:

1. 2.5mL DMEM + 20% FBS + 1 x PS (for culture 7871)  
2\. 1.5mM199+ 20% FBS + 1 x PS (For culture 7725)  

For Passage

  1. TrypLE:     4   mL in      1   tubes
  2.  dPBS (for neutralising):     4    mL
  3.  dPBS (for washing):       4  mL
  4. DMEM + 20% FBS + 1 x PS (for culture 7724 pellet resuspension):     1    mL
  5. M199 + 20% FBS + 1 x PS (for culture 7722 pellet resuspension):     1    mL
  6. DMEM + 20% FBS + 1 x PS (for culture 7724 seeding)::     5    mL
  7. M199 + 20% FBS + 1 x PS (for culture 7722 seeding)::     5    mL 

Time that all aliquots were placed in the water bath the warmed to 30C before
use   time  14:49  

Note: if aliquots were placed in water bath at different time, record the time
stamp for each individual solution.




Passage

  1.  Removed vessel(s) 7724 and 7722 from the incubator   time  15:05
  2. Washed the vessel(s) with dPBS (warmed).
  3. Added   2  mL tryple to each vessel/well and incubated at 30ËšC.
  4. Start/Finish for TrypLE was   time  15:09 - 15:20  

  5. Neutralised each well with   2 mL   dPBS and transferred to   2 x 15mL    tube.
  6. Centrifuged at 650 x g for 5 min.
  7. Start/Finish time for centrifugation was   15:26 - 15:31  

  8. Aspirated the supernatant(s).
  9. Resuspended pellet(s) in   0.5  mL   growth   media
  10.  Aliquoted   10 uL  of resuspended cells into a microcentrifuge tube for cell count.
  11. Performed a cell count using the haemocytometer and recorded the cell count data in the Google Doc spreadsheet called 'Cell Count Spreadsheet' (see link below):

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1DPzKubYxfHmWogVPihC-
SSIBtIylyrBQE5kRX5Z8NtI/edit#gid=0

    1. Total cell number was for culture 7722:     52,000 
    2. Total cell number was for culture 7724:  168,000   

    3. Volume of cell suspension required for subculture was:       used all (500 uL)     

    4. Cell density per vessel:    7K/cm     

    5. 13\. Added cell suspension to 3 mL and 5 mL of growth medium 
    6. 13\. Incubate at 30C and 5% CO2. time15:54
