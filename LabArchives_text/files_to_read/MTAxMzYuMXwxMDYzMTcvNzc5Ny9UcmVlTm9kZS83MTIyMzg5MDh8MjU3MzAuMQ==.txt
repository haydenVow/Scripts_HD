Growth Media:

  * [ ]  DMEM + 10% HS + 1X P/S
  * [ ]  DMEM + 10% HS + 1X P/S + 25ng/mL FGF-basic + P38i (10uM)
  * [ ]  DMEM + 10% HS + 1X P/S + 25ng/mL FGF-basic
  * [ ]  DMEM + 10% HS + 1X P/S + P38i (10uM)
  * [ ]  DMEM + 10% FBS + 1X P/S
  * [ ]  DMEM + 20% FBS + 1X P/S
  * [ ]  DMEM/F12 + 10% FBS + 1X P/S
  * [ ]  DMEM/F12 + 20% FBS + 1X P/S
  * [ ]  DMEM/F12 + 20% FBS + 1X P/S + 25ng/mL FGF-basic
  * [x]  DMEM/F12 + 20% FBS + P38i (10uM)
  * [ ]  DMEM/F12 + 20% FBS + 1X P/S + 25ng/mL FGF-basic + P38i (10uM)

Total media required: 500mL per 4CF if we leave 100mL in flask

Total p38i required: p38 already added

Reagent preperation

NOTE: If confluence is > 80%, these cells may need to be passaged. Will leave
to your discretion @Bec!

1\.  Growth Media placed in water bath   : a/pm




Cell factory Process

  1. Unscrew white cap and remove blue cap and place aside.
  2. Removed   80%    of supernatant from vessel (500mL) by carefully pouring into a waste container with volume markings.
  3. Replaced with       500    mL  (per flask) of  `growth` media by carefully pouring media through the white cap opening
  4. Place caps back and equalise cell factory by placing it on its side (blue cap on the bottom and white cap on the top, see image below:)  
  

4\. Returned vessel to incubate at:

  * [x]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (aviary cells)

  

  * [x]   Incubator:   Sanyo T00117 top incubator in Yurt  Village      
  * [ ]  Top Sanyo Incubator (ID #25)
  * [ ]  Bottom Sanyo Incubator
  * [ ]  Top Binder Incubator
  * [ ]  Bottom Binder Incubator
