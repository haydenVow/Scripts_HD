### Process:

1\. Took image of vessel with microscope on phase setting.

2\. Gelatin coated    2      x    wells of a 6 well plate      vessel with
sterile filtered 0.1% gelatin solution and then incubated all coated flasks at
37˚C.

  1. Time when all vessels(s) placed into the incubator       8:30am 

3\. Aliquotted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then
placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath for a minimum of 20 minutes
prior to use:

  1. TrypLE:    2     mL in     1    tubes
  2.  dPBS (for washing and neutralising):    4     mL in    1    tubes
  3. Growth media (for seeding):     9    mL in     1    tubes

Time that all aliquots were placed in the water bath the warm before use
9:31   am

Note: if aliquots were placed in water bath at different time, record the time
stamp for each individual solution.




4\. Removed vessel(s) from the incubator     9:40   am

5\. Washed the vessel(s) with dPBS (warmed).

6\. Added     2    mL tryple to each vessel/well and incubated at 37˚C.

  1. Start/Finish for TrypLE was     9:42-9:54 am 

7\. Neutralised with    2mL      dPBS and combined cell suspension into a
15mL conical    tube.

8\. Centrifuged at 650 x g for 5 min.

  1. Start/Finish time for centrifugation was     9:56-10:01 am 




9\. Aspirated the supernatant(s).




10\. Resuspended      entire cell pellet to the pre-warmed      9     mL
Growth media:          a/pm

11\. Transferred cell suspension into the pre-gelatin coated      3 x wells of
a 6 well plate (3mL per well)  

12\. Transferred vessel(s) to incubate at:

  * [ x ]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (avian cells)

Observations/Summary:

Lots of cells in one well. Good confluency in some areas. Not clear if it's
true cobblestone morphology, but cells look healthy. Will need to stain for
CD31 again at the MCB/WCB level.




### Results:

  * Results were;
    * [ x ]  As Usual (this is a repetitive task)
    * [ ]  Unexpected because...
    * [ ]  Need to be further analysed
    * [ ]  Other (.......)
