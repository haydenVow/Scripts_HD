Process:

  1. Carefully removed media from well plates and washed cell layer in PBS.
  2. Removed PBS from wells and added 200uL of 4% PFA.
  3. Incubated with PFA for 15 minutes

  1. Removed PFA and washed once with PBS.
  2. Added 1% Sirius Red solution to each well and left for 30 mins at RT.

  1. Removed stain and added 1M NaOH to each well and incubated for 2 hours to solubilise the stain ( : )

  1. Quantify the supernatant from each well at Abs 540nm.




Observations/Summary:

Observationally, 120 -140 mg/ml macroscopically produced the highest amount of
matrix in the cell monolayer.

Cell/sheet loss was observed in a lot of the conditions above 140 mg/ml during
fixing process as these conditions were likely not healthy.

Results and data have been impeded significantly due to cell loss to variable
amounts during liquid transfer process - data will be quite variable and
innaccurate.

Perhaps another way of analysing is needed in the future.
