## Image flask

  1. Observed flask under the microscope at 4x or 5x objective for even cell distribution and < 50% confluency. Refer to VSOP006_0
  2. Took at least 2 images per flask and returned flask back to incubator.

  




## Harvest

  1. Transfer flask and aliquots into BSC, ensuring to wipe down containers with 70% EtOH during the transfer.   
  2. Discarded growth media from each flask 
  3. Washed with warmed dPBS, then discarded. (for cell factory equalised and gently swirled flask

  




  1. Added TrypLE to each of the flasks. Swirled flask thoroughly to ensure coverage of the surface area.
  2. Placed in the incubator at 37C.

  3. After 5 minutes, swirled flask again to ensure all surfaces are covered.
  4. After 10 minute, removed flasks and observed for 95-100% dissociation of cells. Incubated further if needed until maximum dissociation level is reached.

    2. Flask 2 `Time stamp`:13:49
    3. Flask 3 `Time stamp`: 13:49

  




  1. Collected TrypLE solution into 225mL centrifuge tubes (for CHOMP in suspension media) or into 50 mL tubes (for all other conditions).
  2. Wash flask with ambient temperature dPBS and transferred into centrifuge tube. 
  3. Centrifuged at 650 x g for 5 minutes.

      1. 9100 and 9097: 14:14 - 14:19
      2. 9098: 14:16-14:21

  




  1. Gently removed centrifuge tubes from the machine, ensuring not to disturb the suspended pellets Discarded supernatant. Removed remaining supernatant with a 1mL pipette.
  2. Resuspend the pellet in 1 mL of growth media at a time. Pooled into one tube. 
  3. Measure the total volume of the cell resuspension using a serological. Total resuspension volume = 10 mL
  4. Using the same serological, pipette mix cell suspension to ensure a homegenous cell suspension is obtained. 
  5. Immediately aliquot   10 uL  of cell resuspension into cell count tubes. Then, dilute this 1:10 in growth media. Then, take 10 uL from the diluted sample for a cell count.

  




  1. Triturated the obtained cell suspension 10 times (careful not to make bubbles) and transfer into trypan blue.
  2. Triturated the cells suspended in trypan blue at least 10 times (careful not to make bubbles) and transfer 10 uL onto haemocytometer.
  3. Performed cell count and enter details into table below.

### Observations/Summary:

CHOMP in 2CFs containing suspension media started peeling off when imaging.
This refers to 2CFs that were not fed with D/F + 20% FBS + 1x P/S.

Therefore, the passage for these had to be modified to include additional
steps to collect the supernatant and then centrifuge it to collect floating
cells.

Relevant Images/Figures (if any):




EPIC28374 Passaging Procedure:

CHOMP cells treated with suspension media began to lift off the plates in
sheets/worms (8G treatement) or in flakes (6G, 10G, and Hycell Cho exp) so we
passaged them differently, in order to collect cells that had lifted off the
bottom of the CFs.  

1\. collected media and placed in 2x 250mL spin tubes

2\. added 100mL PBS to each CF, rotated around to coat the bottom of the CF,
and added to 250mL spin tubes

3\. added 100mL Tryple to flasks and incubated for 30-50 min at 30C

WHILE THE CFS WERE INCUBATING:

4\.  Spun down 250mL tubes at 650 G for 5 min

5\. Poured off all but ~25mL of the supernatant, then used a pipette to
resuspend the pellet and transfer to a 50mL tube.  This was done in order to
prevent the pellet from dislodging during the pour.

6\. Spun down the 50mL tubes at 650G for 5 min

7\. removed supernatant and resuspended in 10mL of PBS to remove any anti-
tryspin proteins from the serum

8\. spun down 50mL tubes again at 650G for 5 min

9\. removed supernatant and resuspended pellet in ~10mL Tryple.  Incubated at
30C for ~20min

WHILE MEDIA WAS INCUBATING:

10\. removed CFs from incubator and added 100mL PBS to each flask to
deactivate the tryple

11\. poured PBS/Tryple/Cell mixture into 250mL spin tubes (used the same tubes
that were used for the media of each condition) and spun down at 650 G for 5
min

12\. Poured off all but ~25mL of the supernatant, then used a pipette to
resuspend the pellet and transfer to a 50mL tube.  This was done in order to
prevent the pellet from dislodging during the pour.

13\. Removed spin tubes from incubator and resuspended in 10mL PBS to
deactivate the tryple

14\. Spun down all cultures at 650G for 5 min, then combined cells from each
condition into one 50mL tube each

15\.  performed cell counts and seeded as described above.
