### Process:

1\. Took image of vessel with microscope on phase setting.

2\. Aliquotted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then
placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath for a minimum of 20 minutes
prior to use:

  1. TrypLE:   10   mL 
  2.  dPBS (for neutralising):    5   mL
  3.  dPBS (for washing):   5   mL
  4. Growth media (for resus & seeding):
    1.  11 mL x D/F+10%FBS+1xP/S  

    2. 11 mL x D/F+10%KSR  

    3. 10 mL x D/F+5%KSR+5%FBS+0.5xP/S  

Time that all aliquots were placed in the water bath the warm before use
13:00   a/pm

Note: if aliquots were placed in water bath at different time, record the time
stamp for each individual solution.




4\. Removed vessel(s) from the incubator     13:41   a/pm

5\. Washed the vessel(s) with dPBS (warmed).

6\. Added   10   mL tryple to each vessel/well and incubated at 37˚C.

  1. Start/Finish for TrypLE was     13:46 - 13:58    

7\. Neutralised with   10 mL   dPBS and combined cell suspension into    2 x
15 mL  tubes.

8\. Centrifuged at 650 x g for 5 min.

  1. Start/Finish time for centrifugation was     14:02 - 14:07     




9\. Aspirated the supernatant(s).

10\. Resuspended pellet(s) in    1   mL    respective    media

11\. Aliquoted   2 x 10 uL   of resuspended cells into a microcentrifuge tube
for cell count.

12\. Performed a cell count using the haemocytometer and recorded the cell
count data in the Google Doc spreadsheet: Cell Count Spreadsheet or cell count
widget below

  1. Total cell number was:     FBS: 2,208,000 KSR: 1,708,000       

  2. Volume of cell suspension required for subculture was:     FBS (2 x T25s): 160 uL KSR / (2xT25s): 197 uL / FBS+KSR (2xT25s): 160 uL (from FBS culture)       

  3. Cell density per vessel:    7000 cells / cm2   




13\. Transferred    160 / 160 / 197  µl of cell suspension to the pre-warmed
3 x 10 mL aliquots    Growth media

14\. Transferred cell suspension into T25s 14:50  

15\. Transferred vessel(s) to incubate at: 14:54

  * [x]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells) THERMO  

  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (avian cells)




Observations/Summary:  

1) Cells in 10%KSR medium formed sheet again. Sheet peeled away when pressure
was applied from pipette and lifted fully off the plastic after 10 minutes in
Tryple. It did appear to be a smaller sheet than last time when the cells were
in 20% KSR medium

2) KSR cells appeared more confluent than FBS cells prior to passaging (based
off micrographs). The cells that combined to form the sheet had to be
discarded due to being unable to break them up without causing too much damage
to other viable cells (which may have been the reason behind cell death after
passaging last time)
