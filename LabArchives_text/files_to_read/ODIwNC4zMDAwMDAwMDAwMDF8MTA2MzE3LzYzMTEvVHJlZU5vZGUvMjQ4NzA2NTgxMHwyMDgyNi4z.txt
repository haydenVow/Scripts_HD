Outside lab (at Alpaca biopsy site)

  1. Extract ~ 1 teaspoon volume of bone marrow from interior of bone (shank) into 1 x 50mL falcon tube. 14:52 pm

Transfer sample into lab

  1. Add 20ml dPBS + 1X P/S into the tube with bone marrow.
  2. Disaggregate clumps with needle-less syringe or pipette and pass through a 70um cell strainer. 16:00-16:05 pm
  3. Centrifuge at 250 x g for 5 min at RT to pellet cells. 16:06-16:11 pm
  4. Centrifuge at 700 x g for 5 min at RT to pellet cells. 16:12-16:17 pm
  5. Centrifuge at 2000 x g for 5 min at RT to pellet cells. 16:17-16:22 pm
  6. Resuspend cell pellet in 6mL freeze media.
  7. Aliquot into 6 x cryovials at 1mL each.
  8. Transfer cryovials into Mr Frosty. Place Mr Frosty in -80C freezer. 16:29 pm



  1. 10mL of supernatant from the centrifuged tube was set aside and plated onto 1 x non-coated 100mm culture dish.
