Process:

1\. Aliquotted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then
placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath for a minimum of 20 minutes
prior to use:

  1. TrypLE:    60   mL in  1 x 120 ml     tubes
  2. dPBS (for neutralising)   120 ml    mL in  1 x 120 ml   tubes
  3. dPBS (for pellet resuspension):   10   mL in    1 x 15 ml    tubes
  4. Times that all aliquots were placed in the water bath to warm before use    14:50 - 15:10  

Note: if aliquots were placed in water bath at different times, record the
time stamp for each individual solution.




2\. Washed the flask(s) with dPBS.

3\. Added   10    mL tryple to each vessel/well and incubated at 37ËšC for   8
min.

Note: Fibroblasts typically require 15-18 minutes of incubation with tryple,
slightly longer than MuSCs.

  1. Start/Finish time for tryple was    15:36    \-    15:41   pm

4\. Neutralised with   10    dPBS (warmed) and combined cell suspension into
3 x 50 ml   tube.

5\. Centrifuged at 400 x g for 5 min

  1. Start/Finish time for centrifugation was    16:00    \-    16:05  a/pm 




6\. Aspirated the supernatant(s)

7\. Resuspended pellet(s) in     10   mL    Growth   media.

8\. Performed a cell count using the haemocytometer and recorded the cell
count data in widget or the Google Doc spreadsheet called 'Cell Count
Spreadsheet' (see link below):

9\. Total cell number was:   37,000,000  

Cells were used for nucleofection Round 6 experiment (see seeded flask entry),
Excess cells were discarded as it was deemed that the cells had reached too
high a passage number. New cells will be thawed for future Nucleofection
experiments.

Flasks 10947-10952 were discarded




Observations/Summary:

SOPs used:

  

  




Relevant Images/Figures (if applicable):

Images were captured of two flasks prior to passage, cells appeared 100%
confluent with minimal peeling from the base of the flask.
