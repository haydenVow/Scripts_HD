### Process:






4\. Aspirated and discarded media from the flask

5\. Washed the vessel(s) with 10mL dPBS (room temp)

6\. Discarded wash then added    10     mL tryple to each vessel/well and
incubated at 30ËšC, 5% CO2 for 12 minutes.  

7\. Neutralised with     10     of dPBS and combined cell suspension into a
1x50mL    tubes 20mL total.

8\. Cells were spun at 500 g for 5 minutes.

9\. Cells were resuspended in 10 mL of dPBS and re-counted.  

Took 10uL of each resuspension for a cell count as per instructions below.




CELL COUNT

12\. Performed a cell count using the haemocytometer and recorded the cell
count data in the Google Doc spreadsheet: Cell Count Spreadsheet or cell count
widget below.

  1. Total cell number for cultures 12899.  3494333  

  2.    Volume of cell suspension required for subculture: 
    1. (T75 culture in 20% FBS media), 1.4mL of cell suspension, 5x10^5 cells
    2. (T175 culture in 10% FBS media)  3.4mL of cell suspension 1.225x10^6 cells  

Volumes of cell suspensions above were aliquoted into T flasks containing
respective media. 12mL of growth media in a T75 flask or 30mL of media in a
T175 flask.

  1. Cell density per vessel:    (T175, 7000 cells/cm^2) (T75, ~6500cells/cm^2).     
  2. Flask was transferred to incubate at 30 degrees 5% CO2, incubator 68.   




Banking of Cells

5mL of cell suspension (~1.7x10^6 cells) were banked down in CryostorCS10
freeze media.  
Briefly

  1. Cells were spun down at 500g for 5 minutes and media was replaced with CryostorCS10 to a cell concentration of 1x10^6 cells/mL 
  2. 880uL of cells (~8.8x10^5 cells) were distributed into two 2mL cryovial tubes (Cryovial ID's 15434, 15433)
