11mL is needed for each biopsy. Prepare fresh before tissue digestion.
Sterilize with 0.22 μm filter. 10:10 am

  2. Prepare in hood: Scalpels, blotting paper, dissection scissors, 2mL aliquot of MDB, 100mm plates, 50mL tubes ready and labelled with cell type and Col II Lot #, Parafilm.

  3. Prepared DMEM/F12+0.2% collagenase II + 0.01156% dispase solution (for MM's tissue digestion recorded below) by adding 49 mL Wash Media, 0.1 g collagenase type II powder and 1 mL stock dispase solution (Stock ID 1461) and mixing well.

  



  1. Collect muscle biopsy, transfer to BSC. `   
`

  2. Transfer the biopsy to 1 x 10cm plate containing 2mL WM in the Biosafety cabinets to perform the following steps:
  3. Cut each biopsy into 4-5 pieces using dissection scissors.
  4. Transfer pieces from each biopsy to a fresh 100mm plate (or use the lids of the initial dishes).

Note* Perform all following steps for each biopsy provided.

Blot the biopsy to remove any blood, and then quickly cut off any adherent
fat/connective tissue (don't spend ages doing this, just anything large
clearly hanging off). Get the biopsy into a dish sooner rather later to
prevent it from drying out.

Observations:  
  
  
Observations: A few white bits (connective tissue), easy to mince. Had some
trouble passing it through a 5mL serological due to connective tissue  
Observations: Few more white connective tissue bits than previous biopsy on
Monday (2.5) but digested easily and was able to pass up and down a 5mL
serological pipette tip smoothly  

Top up the sample in the 120 mL sample pot with an additional 48 mL of
DMEM/F12+0.2% collagenase II + 0.01156% dispase solution and add the magnetic
stirrer flea.  
  
Transfer the minced muscle to a 50 mL conical tube up to 10mL of MDB (freshly
prepared and filtered).

Set aside the tube that held the biopsy piece while in storage before
processing on the bench (with lid firmly attached and parafilmed) and incubate
it at room temperature overnight to check for overt signs of microbial
contamination.  
  
Add 10mL of Wash Media to the original plate that had the  biopsy transferred
to it. Parafilm plate with a new lid & incubate at 37ºC to monitor
contamination.

Seal the 120 mL pot well with Parafilm and incubate in a 37°C water bath set
upon a magnetic stirring platform so that the magnetic flea can be driven by
the stirrer platform. Turn on the stirrer and commence agitation for 30
minutes to digest the tissue.

the shaking path and completely submerged in water. Use weights to keep the
tubes submerged.

Remove the sample pot from the water bath and inspect for signs that the
tissue has been digested (no visible pieces of the tissue will be visible
after manual agitation.

If the tissue is well suspended, it will triturate through a 10 mL serological
pipette. If this does not occur, continue digestion int he waterbath for a
further 10 minutes before proceeding.

If the muscle is well digested, triturate through a 10mL serological pipette.

If there are still muscle chunks, `using a 10 mL syringe and 20-gauge needle,
aspirate and eject the muscle suspension in and out of the syringe 10 times.`

CRITICAL STEP: The needle may be clogged by small pieces of tendon or
undigested muscle during the first few attempts. If clogging occurs during
trituration, remove the clog from the tip of the needle. If clogging occurs
during ejection, pull the plunger up and down to move the clog out of
position. Eject towards the wall of the tube (as opposed to the bottom) to
avoid foaming.
