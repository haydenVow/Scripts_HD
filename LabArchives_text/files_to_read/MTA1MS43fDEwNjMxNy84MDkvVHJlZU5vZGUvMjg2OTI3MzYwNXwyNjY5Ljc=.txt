Process:

Aliquotted media is in containers in the fridge under main lab Zaber.

  1. 500uL of each media were warmed in the incubator in 70mL sterile containers.  13 :02-13:20    

    1. DMEM/F12 + 2% HS + 0.2x P/S
    2. E6 made fresh
    3. E6 made from bullet
  2. Using a multi-channel pipette, slowly removed 50% of media (70uL/well) from column 2. Slowly added 70uL/well of 2% HS media.
  3. Slowly removed 50% of media from column 3. Added E6 made fresh into each of these wells.
  4. Slowly removed 50% of  media from column 4. Added E6 made from bullet into these wells.
  5. Returned plate to incubator: 13:26
