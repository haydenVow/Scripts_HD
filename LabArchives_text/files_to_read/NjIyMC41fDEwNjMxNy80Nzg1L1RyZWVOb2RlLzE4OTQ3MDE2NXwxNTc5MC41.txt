## Process

  1. Prepared 2M solution of GABA according to E8_9C Media Calculator instructions.
  2. Prepared 2M hypoxanthine solution according to E8_9C Media Calculator instructions.
  3. Added all the ingredients needed for   119 mL of E8 medium following E8 calculator spreadsheet.
  4. Added ACF ingredients for 120 mL of medium as indicated in the E8_9C Media Calculator spreadsheet (EXCEPT FOR ALBUMIN - DO NOT ADD YET).
  5. Create 3 x 40 mL aliquots of the E8_9C and add one of the following to each (final conc. in solution = 150 ug/mL):
    1. 90 uL x rHA albumin (Original richcore) 
    2. 90 uL x rHA albumin (New richcore) 
    3.  ~~6000 ug / 6 mg x rHA albumin (AKRON)~~
    4. 239.8 uL x Sigma albumin  ~~  
~~

  6. Sterile filtered media.
  7. Added 0.4 mL of lipids to each aliquot (E8_9C Media Calculator).
  8. Labelled and stored in the fridge.
