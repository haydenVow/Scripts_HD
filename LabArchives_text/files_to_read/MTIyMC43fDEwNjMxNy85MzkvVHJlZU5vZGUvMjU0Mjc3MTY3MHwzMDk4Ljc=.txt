  2. Removed  50 % of supernatant (150 mL) from 1 x 2CF by carefully pouring into a waste container with 150mL marked.
  3. Replaced with  150 mL (per flask) of growth (10C) media by carefully pouring media through the white cap opening (alternatively you may use a 50mL serological to add media.)
  4. Place caps back and equalise 2CF by placing it on its side (blue cap on the bottom and white cap on the top, see image below:)  
  

4\. Returned vessel to incubate at:

  * [x]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
