Growth Media:

  * [x]  DMEM/F12 + 20% FBS + 1X P/S + P38i (10uM)

  




### Process:

1\. Images captured of each well under 5x objective on the primovert and wells
were manually inspected to determine confluence.

2\. wells with cell numbers that appeared >30% confluent were selected for
expansion to 6 well plates. These included the following wells.

  1. Plate 7037: Well B3
  2. Plate 7038: Well A4, C4, D2.

3\. Clone picking maps were generated [1-2pm] in the following spreadsheet
based on this selection criteria.

2\. Gelatin coated     4 wells on 1     x     6wp     with sterile 50uL
filtered 0.1% gelatin solution and then incubated all coated flasks at 37˚C.

  1. Time when all vessels(s) placed into the incubator      12:05   

3\. Aliquotted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then
placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath for a minimum of 20 minutes
prior to use:

  1. TrypLE:     1   mL in    1x1.5mL tube    .
  2. Growth media (for seeding):     15    mL in     1x50mL    tube. 

Time that all aliquots were placed in the water bath the warm before use
12:48  a/pm

Note: if aliquots were placed in water bath at different time, record the time
stamp for each individual solution.




4\. Once 6 well plates had incubated for 1h with gelatin the gelatin was
removed and replaced with 3mL of the prewarmed growth media. The plates were
left inside the incubator, 37 degrees, 5% CO2. 15:52 [13:10]  
  
5\. Washed wells identified from the picklist generated below with 200uL of
dPBS after removing and discarding growth media. Wells were marked on the
outside of the lid for each 24wp well plate due for passage. Destination well
locations on the 6 wp were written above each marking made on the 24wp lid.

6\. Aspirated and discarded the dPBS and incubated the same wells in     0.15
mL tryple at 37˚C.

  1. Start/Finish for TrypLE (20 minutes): 13:00-13:20.   
  

7\. Neutralised by transferring 200uL of growth media from each destination
well on the 6wp to its respective well on the 24 well plate per the plate map
above. Let the 6wp sit in the incubator for 30 minutes: 13:22-13:52.  

8\. Returned 6 well plates to incubate at 37 degrees, 5% CO2, incubator #78.
