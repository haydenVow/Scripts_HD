## Materials Prep

Preparation of 4% Alginate solution: from previous study

Preparation of 100mM CaCl2: from previous study

Gelatin 4% in DMEM:

  1.  dissolve 3.2 g Gelatin in 80 mL DMEM/F12
  2. heat to 60C under stirring and wait for complete dissolution, start 13:45
  3. sterile filter using 0.1 um filter flask
  4. keep warm to prevent gelation

Laminin (150 uL): use stock after dilution with GM

Collagen: use PureColl EZ gel stock after 5x dilution with GM

## Encapsulation of cells

  1. centrifuge 55M cells and resuspend in growth media to a total max volume of 0.7 mL       5.30pm    
  2. Prepare cell suspensions in alginate at varying loading densities:
  3. TABLE WITH MIXES SEE BELOW
  4.  Prepare cell free alginate gel only and dispense first:   5.35 pm    

  5. using a P200 for each condition, produce gel droplets at the pipette tip and drop into a Calcium bath (1.5mL in 24wp well) from a close distance (to avoid deformation and maintain spherical shape). 5 "meatballs" per well only to allow for sufficient media to feed the encapsulated cells. 8-10 cell-free beads for controls.  

  6.  Gelation will occur within 2 minutes, but allow approximately 5 minutes for firm gel formation.
  7. Transfer all inserts to a new plate preloaded with 1.5 mL media (wash 1) for 2 min
  8. Transfer all inserts to a new plate preloaded with 1.5 mL media (wash 2) for 2 min
  9. Transfer all inserts to a new plate preloaded with 1.5 mL media
  10. Put plate in incubator: 18:00
  11. CREATE PLATE ID:
