Aim/Purpose


To identify the cause of debris seen occasionally on the DAPI channel after
performing fluorescence staining of suspension cultures.


Hypothesis


Performing a fluorescent stain in a non-sterile environment with non-sterile
pipette tips results in debris that is visible on the DAPI channel.


Technical Gap


We have not thoroughly investigated the cause of fluorescent debris before and
we have not identified/isolated the cause to prevent this from occurring
again. Fluorescence staining of samples from suspension cultures is important
to obtain cell counts and assess the effects of different variables on cell
growth rates. If debris is present, we cannot use the images obtained to get
accurate cell coubts.

Testing if non-sterile pipette tips are the issue

  * Make a staining solution (PBS + Hoechst + Sytox). Ideally this should be made in a BSC using sterile PBS (filtered), sterile Hoechst, and sterile Sytox). 
  * Use 12 sterile tips to pipette 100uL/well of staining solution into 12 wells of a 96 well plate in a BSC.  
  * Outside the BSC, use 12 non-sterile tips to pipette 100uL/well of staining solution into 96 well plate. Use random tips across different tip boxes.

Testing if precipitation/interaction between different reagents is the issue

Prepare reagents in BSC and perform all steps in BSC.

Check the following reagents under the microscope by adding a few drops into
96 well plate.

  * Hoechst alone
  * Sytox alone
  * Hoechst and Sytox together (3:1 ratio)

Next, look at the following reagents

  * on their own
  * with 3 drops/mL of Hoechst
  * with 1 drop/mL of Sytox
  * with both Hoechst and Sytox

Reagents:

  * PBS
  * Hank's buffered salt solution 
  * RPMI + 5% FBS
  * RPMI + 20% KSR 
  * CD-CHO + 5% FBS
  * CD-CHO + 20% KSR 

For all conditions, image immediately and also image after 4 hours.
