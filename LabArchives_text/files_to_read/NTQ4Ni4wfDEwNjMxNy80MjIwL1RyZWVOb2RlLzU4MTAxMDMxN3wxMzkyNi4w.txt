### Process:

1\. Took image of vessel with microscope on phase setting.

3\. Aliquotted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then
placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath for a minimum of 20 minutes
prior to use:

  1. TrypLE:     6    mL in    1   tubes
  2.  dPBS (for washing and neutralising):    8 x 3mL (for washing and neutralising cells from each condition)   mL
  3. Growth media (for seeding):    4 x 3mL (10% FBS, 2 with p53i and 2 without p53i) and 4 x 3mL (20% FBS, 2 with p53i and 2 without p53i)     mL 

Time that all aliquots were placed in the water bath the warm before use
11:25 am

Note: if aliquots were placed in water bath at different time, record the time
stamp for each individual solution.




4\. Removed vessel(s) from the incubator

5\. Washed the vessel(s) with dPBS (warmed).

6\. Added      0.2   mL tryple to each well and incubated at 37˚C.

  1. Start/Finish for TrypLE was    11:43 pm 
    1. Note* Plates checked under phase and <20% detachment noticed at 11:55 am. Plates returned to 37C incubator.  

    2. Note* at 12:08pm, cells -UV and -p53i are detached, but cells in +UV+p53i conditions are not detached. Will try trypsin for those  

    3. Added 500uL/well of Trypsin/EDTA to all wells in UV treated plates. `Aliquot # 5591` 12:16 - 12:20 pm  

    4. 12:24, trypsin still on and still very low detachment. Will need to neutralise now but will need to look into this issue  

7\. Neutralised with    0.5mL    dPBS per well and combined cell suspension
from each condition into a     1 x 15mL    tube.

Wells from non-UV treated plates neutralised 12:15 pm

8\. Centrifuged at 650 x g for 5 min.

  1. Start/Finish time for centrifugation was   12:30 - 12:35 pm 




9\. Aspirated the supernatant(s).

10\. Resuspended pellet(s) in     3    mL     respetive     media




  

14\. Transferred cell suspension into the     6-well plates (see plate maps
above).

16\. Transferred vessel(s) to incubate at: 12:52 pm  

  * [X ]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (avian cells)




Observations/Summary:

Cells combined from each condition and seeded into 1 x well of a 6-well plate
(per condition).

  

Observation: Cells in +UV+p53i condition did not detach with Tryple, and even
after the addition of warm Trypsin/EDTA for 9 minutes, cells were still mostly
attached. Pipetting was used to encourage cells to detach from the surface of
the 24-well plates, however cells were lost in this process.
