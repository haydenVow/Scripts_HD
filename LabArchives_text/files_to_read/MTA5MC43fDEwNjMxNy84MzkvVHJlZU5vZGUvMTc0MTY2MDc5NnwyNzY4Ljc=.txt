Stained and imaged cells adhered to microcarriers

  1. Removed culture(s) from the incubator and placed them in the BSC  `| 13:42 am/pm|`
  2. Swirled culture(s) by hand on the flat surface of the BSC for 5 seconds, the lid was quickly removed and a 20uL sample of the suspension was taken while the liquid was still in motion. This ensures the carriers were evenly mixed at time of sampling.
  3. Transferred the aliquot(s) to a well on a 96 well plate. This was done for 3 samples per E125 flask.
    1. Row A: culture #6673 (serum)
    2. Row B: culture #6674 (E89C)
    3. Row C: culture #6675 (E810C)
    4. Row D: culture #6676
  4. Returned cultures to the incubator  `| 13:48 am/pm|`
  5. Mixed samples with 80 uL of dPBS containing 1% w/v poloxomer 88 and 20uL/mL of Hoechst 33342. 
  6. Left the 96 well plate to incubate at room temperature, in the dark (away from light), for 12 minutes.  `| 14:00 - 14:12 am/pm |`
  7. `Using the Zaber, captured 1 image per well on 5x on Phase and DAPI. Images were captured under the culture ID 6702`.
  8. the 96 wp was parafilmed and stored in the fridge.
