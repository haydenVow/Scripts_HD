Note

Due to the drop in cell numbers at todays count, conditions that were passaged
into 50mL shaker tubes (1 per condition)




Process:  

  1. Aliquoted 110mL Nuvonis suspension media into a urine jar
  2. In the BSC, added 11ul EGF, 220ul FGF2 and 110ul IGF1-LR3 to the urine jar. 
  3. Placed in the water bath and warm to 37C 
  4. Collected vessels from shaker, and brought into BSC 
  5. Transferred contents of shaker tubes to 50mL tubes.
  6. Centrifuged for 5min at 400RPM
  7. Aspirated and discarded 15mL media from each tube (leaving 5mL)
  8. Re-suspended cell pellets in the remaining media, repeatedly pipetting with a 1mL pipette to break up clumps. 
  9. Took 2x 10ul aliquot from each culture and performed trypan blue counts (see counts in table below)
  10. Due to the low cell counts, cells were passaged from E125s to 50mL shakers. The 5mL cell suspension from each culture was transferred to 1 x 50mL shaker per condition. 
  11. Added 5mL of pre-warmed media from the urine jar to culture 11964 and returned to the incubator.
  12. Added 5mL of pre-warmed media  \+ .5ul YIGSR  to culture 11965 and returned to the incubator.
  13. Took 10mL aliquot of media from the urine jar and added .5uL RGD
  14. Added 5mL of pre-warmed media from the urine jar (containing RGD) to culture 11966
  15. Added 5mL of pre-warmed media from the urine jar (containing RGD)  \+ 0.5ul YIGSR  to culture 11967 and returned to the incubator.
