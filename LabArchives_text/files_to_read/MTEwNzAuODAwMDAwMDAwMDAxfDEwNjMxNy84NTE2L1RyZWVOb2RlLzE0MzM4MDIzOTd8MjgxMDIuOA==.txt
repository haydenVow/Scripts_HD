RELATED TO OKR: N/A

AIM/PURPOSE: To determine whether we can reliably and safely use reagents
other than those sourced from Beckman Coulter to operate the ViCell XR

HYPOTHESIS: That reagents purchased from sources other than Beckman Coulter
will perform just as well as the reagent pack sold by Beckman Coulter in terms
of cell count accuracy and reliability

RESULTS SUMMARY: State the key take-aways from the experiment in 1-2 sentences

CONCLUSIONS: State whether your hypothesis was supported or not. In some
instances, the hypothesis will be less relevant, so this will be less
important (e.g. generating WCBs). If your EPIC is not a hypothesis-driven
research experiment, you can state that this is a "process" in the header's
aim, and indicate "NA" for the hypothesis & conclusions.

NEXT STEPS: Bullet points should be used to indicate what experiments (if any)
will be completed as a direct result of this experiment. In addition, you
should think about how the experiment could be done better next time (e.g. if
I was to repeat this experiment I would include an additional timepoint at day
5 to understand whether the number of Myogenin positive cells decreased before
myotube delamination occurred"

[NOTE: Where appropriate, please indicate WHO will take responsibility and put
a date for completion. (e.g. "James will create an SOP detailing the new
methodology by the end of August 2021" or "Tom will repeat the experiment on
18th November 2021")
