Perform feed using below volumes:




## Feed performed by: Shaleen  




Process:

1\. Remove media aliquots from fringe 104 (10 mL  mL of each respective type
of Growth Media) and place in the water bath   11:07 am  

2\. Placed shake tubes in centrifuge and centrifuge at 650 x g for 5 min at
RT.   11:39 - 11:44am  

3\. Aspirated supernatant from each pellet

4\. Added 1mL of respective growth media to each tube and used a P1000 pipette
to break up cell clumps.

5 .Remaining 9mL of each respective media was added afterwards and triturated
with 10mL serological pipette to break up cell clumps for each culture further
and resuspend cells evenly.

6\. Returned vessel to incubate at:   11:57am

  * [X ]  37ÂºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * Incubator (#67 ), Lab [Library]




Observations:

\- Pellets were distinct and clear after centrifuging across all four
conditions.
