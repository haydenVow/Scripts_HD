Growth Media:

  * [x]  DMEM/F12 + 20% FBS + 1X P/S + P38i (10uM). 




### Process:

1\. Aliquotted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then
placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath for a minimum of 20 minutes
prior to use:

  1. TrypLE:     9    mL in    1x15mL     tubes
  2.  dPBS (for washing and neutralising):      9   mL in    1x15mL    tube
  3. Growth media (for seeding):     4x5mL    mL in    4x15mL     tubes

Time that all aliquots were placed in the water bath the warm before use
10:33   a/pm

2\. 10:35-10:43 Took image of vessel with the zaber on Phase, settings: 4x3
grid under 5x magnification, 6ms exposure time, all 6 wells on the plate were
imaged, 1.23 lamp intensity.

Note: if aliquots were placed in water bath at different time, record the time
stamp for each individual solution.




  

5\. Washed the vessel(s) with dPBS (warmed).

6\. Added     2    mL tryple to each well and incubated at 37˚C.

  1. Start/Finish for TrypLE was     10:50-11:05   a/pm 

7\. Neutralised each well with     2    dPBS and transferred cell suspensions
into separate    15mL     tubes. Added an additional 2mL of dPBS to each tube
so that tighter pellets would form during centrifugation.  

8\. Centrifuged at 650 x g for 5 min.

  1. Start/Finish time for centrifugation was     11:21-11:26   a/pm 




13\. Aspirated and discarded supernatant from each tube, Transferred each of
the     5mL     growth media aliquots to separate 15mL tubes containing
clones.    11:40    a/pm

14\. Transferred cell suspensions into separate T25 flasks.  

16\. Transferred vessel(s) to incubate at: 11:50

  * [x]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (avian cells)
