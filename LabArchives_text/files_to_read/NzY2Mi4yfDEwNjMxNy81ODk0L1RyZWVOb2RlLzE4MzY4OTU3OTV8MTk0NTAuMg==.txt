## Preparation for feeding and sampling 50 mL shake tubes and 24 deep well
plates  

  1. Aliquotted growth media for each condition and added growth factors (see previous lab book entry)
  2. Added the reagents to the water bath OR incubator and warmed at 37 degrees Celsius 11:03
  3. Paused shaker by pressing the "play" button on the controller on the side wall of the incubator
  4. Collected shake tubes from shaker 
  5. Centrifuged at 300 x g for 5 min
    1. Timestamp : tubes: 11:17 - 11:22, plates:11:25 - 11:30
  6. While tubes were centrifuging, loaded protocol (added protocol as attachment) on computer next to OT2 and set up deck as described at calibration step
  7. Ethanol-sprayed shake tubes and loaded on OT2
  8. Collected media aliquots from water bath, ethanol-sprayed, and loaded on OT2 deck. Ensured that media aliquot deck positions matched up with intended feed tube positions.
  9. Calibrated the pipet head. Note: OT2 will attempt to calibrate to position A1 of Media Rack 2, this is expected run proceeded as normal.
  10. Ran protocol  
    1.  Start time:  11:41:41 AM
    2.  END TIME: 31:28 min  

    3. Total run time: ~12:12 pm
  11. Replaced caps and returned tubes to the incubator  12:40

37° C Incubator (#), Lab [Main/Library/Production]

30° C Incubator (#), Lab [Main/Library/Production]




In the OT2 protocol below

condition 1 = CD-CHO + 10% KSR + 6G

condition 2 = D/F + 20% FBS + 1x P/S

condition 3 = CD-CHO + 20% KSR + 10G




Staining

Prepare dead stain solution in amber/black centrifuge tube:  
\- 2 mL dPBS  
\- 2 drops Nucgreen AF488 dead stain  
\- Vortex for 5 seconds to mix

Prepare Hoechst stain (50 ug/mL) solution in amber/black centrifuge tube:  
\- 570 uL MilliQ  
\- 30 uL Hoechst Trihydrochloride trihydrate (1mg/mL)  
\- Vortex for 5 seconds to mix. Solution can be stored at 4°C for up to 6
months

Hoechst mix: m6192

  1. Add 20 uL of Hoechst stain directly to cells
  2.  Add 80 uL of dead stain solution (dPBS+Nucgreen) to cells
  3. Incubate for 30 minutes in the dark at room temperature   12:20 - 12:50    

  4. Make 4x and, 8x dilutions of the sample in dPBS 
  5. Centrifuge plates at 300 RCF for 1 minute 13:00
  6. Prepared plate map:  
\- Created a new "MIA output" data workbook by copying the template at the
following link:
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xcd91iDvrnbp8GeXPJOyePzY0skm0JVVEZf7Ngk88NM/edit?usp=sharing  
\- Filled in each of the sheets according to how the samples were arranged  
\- Pasted the link to the "MIA output" workbook here:




## Imaging

  1. Configure the Zaber session to image the entirety of each well; for 96 well plates this requires a 3 x 3 stitched image
  2. Take images of each well on the blue fluorescence ("DAPI") and green fluorescence ("AF488") channels. culture ID for images: 9345, imaged at 13:08    




## Analysis

  1. Analyzed the blue- and green-channel images using the DAPI and AF488 MIA macros respectively.
  2. Downloaded and extracted the data then pasted it into the "MIA output" data workbook created in the "Staining" section.
  3. Copied the data from the "Final output" sheet of the "MIA output" data workbook to the "Master Cell Counting Sheet" of the "Suspension culture counting spreadsheet":

Observations/Summary  

cultures were discarded after obtaining cell counts as cultures did not seem
to be bouncing back from fast adaptation and there was limited space in
incubators/shakers for these vessels.
