### Process:

1\. Took image of vessel with microscope on phase setting.

3\. Aliquotted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then
placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath for a minimum of 20 minutes
prior to use:

  1. TrypLE:    22     mL in     1    tubes
  2.  dPBS (for neutralising):      11 x 2mL
  3.  dPBS (for washing):     11    mL
  4. Growth media (for seeding):     60    mL 

Time that all aliquots were placed in the water bath the warm before use
15:29 pm

Note: if aliquots were placed in water bath at different time, record the time
stamp for each individual solution.




4\. Removed vessel(s) from the incubator    15:43 pm

5\. Washed the vessel(s) with dPBS (warmed).

6\. Added    2     mL tryple to each vessel/well and incubated at 37˚C.

  1. Start/Finish for TrypLE was    15:55  pm 

7\. Neutralised with      2mL    dPBS and combined each clone's cell
suspension into a     15mL    tube.

8\. Centrifuged at 650 x g for 5 min.

  1. (first 8 clones) Start/Finish time for centrifugation was    16:23 pm 
  2. (next 3 clones) Start/Finish time for centrifugation was    16:29 pm




9\. Aspirated the supernatant(s).

10\. Resuspended pellet(s) in     5    mL      Growth    media  




11\. Transfer cell suspension for each clone into 1 x T25 flask each.

16\. Transferred vessel(s) to incubate at: 16:52 PM  

  * [ X ]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (avian cells)




Observations/Summary:

11 x clones (from 6-well plates) expanded into 1 x T25 flask each.
