RELATED TO MILESTONE:

AIM/PURPOSE:  To determine whether the lack of differentiation seen on zein is
due to the scaffold material, cell type or antibody

HYPOTHESIS: We will be able to visualise differentiation of C2C12 and DOLLY12
cells on planar culture but not on zein scaffolds.

RESULTS SUMMARY: See Report.

CONCLUSIONS: Positive MF20 and MyoG antibody staining was seen with C2C12
cells on planar samples, but was not observed on the Zein scaffolds,
regardless of the secondary antibody dilution used (1:500 or 1:1000). The lack
of staining on zein was concluded to be either due to the cells being unable
to differentiate on the material, or the zein absorbing/interfering with the
antibodies.

NEXT STEPS: When investigating new materials it will be important for us to
have an alternative method from immunofluorescence microscopy for assessing
differentiation on scaffolds. Currently we are exploring the use of ELISA's
for the assessment of differentiation. However, due to the reliance on
antibody staining in the ELISA method it can be predicted that we may run into
similar limitations, with the scaffold material influencing the uptake of the
stains. As a result research into methods such as western blotting, which are
independent of antibody staining, may provide a more useful alternative and
should be considered moving forward.
