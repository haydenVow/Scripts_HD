Process:

Preparing BSA standard curve:

  1. Made up stock of 2 mg/ml BSA solution by dissolving 100mg of BSA into 50mL water.
  2. Performed dilutions to make up 2000, 1500, 1000, 750, 500, 250, 125, 25, 12.5, 6.25 ug/ml solutions of BSA. Placed on ice.

Sample dilution:

  1. Added 250uL of Bradford reagent to each of the wells for the standard, and to all the corresponding four wells of the Gelatin (1%) sample wells.
  2. Add 5uL of each standards to the respective wells and observe colour change. A distinct gradient from blue to brown was observed as expected.
  3. Performed dilutions of 1% Gelatin and added 5uL of each to the corresponding 250uL Bradford reagent already in the wells.
  4. Each well was mixed thoroughly and then the plate was centrifuged for 3 mins at 1160 RPM.
  5. No colour change was observed even after 5 mins and mixing. Plate was read on plate reader at 595nm and it was found that the Gelatin is so dilute that would not show up past the limit of detection (LOD)
  6. Process was repeated for multiple concentrations of Collagen and then read on plate reader, it was found that the Bradford assay is insensitive to Collagen.
  7. Process was repeated for a 1 mg/mL stock of Gelatin that was prepared by mixing 50mg of Gelatin powder into 50mL of water. The stock was placed in waterbath for 10 mins (approx.) to dissolve gelatin. This was diluted into 1:2 and 1:5 aliquots.
