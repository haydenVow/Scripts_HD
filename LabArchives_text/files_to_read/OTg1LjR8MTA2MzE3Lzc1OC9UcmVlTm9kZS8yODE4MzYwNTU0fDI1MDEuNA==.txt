Experimental Plan

Experiment 1. Basic functions

  1. perfusion flow rate (currently 500mL/min)
  2. outlet tube configuration (straight or bent, outlet height in reactor)
  3. dye equilibration after media changes after 50% media volume change
  4. stir speed (magnetic stir bar)

Experiment 2.  Gas equilibration requirements

  1. CO2 and air sparging (gas flowrates required to achieve a given DO and pH)
  2.  stir/perfusion speed required for uniform DO distribution 

Experiment 3. Biological impact of perfusion system

  1. Sample placement in 3D
  2. gas partial pressures (what oxygen perfusion is beneficial)
  3. stir rate/recirculation speed
  4. media change frequency

etc...
