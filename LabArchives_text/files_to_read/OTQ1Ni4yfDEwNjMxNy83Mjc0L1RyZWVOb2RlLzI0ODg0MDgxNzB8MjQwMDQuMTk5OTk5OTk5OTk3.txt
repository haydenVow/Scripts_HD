Aim


Expand CB01s-p dolphin fibroblast cells to a MCB.


Hypothesis


Continued culture of an initial population of 1M CB01s-p dolphin fibroblast
cells will allow for a bank of ~100 million cells within 3 passages.


Technical gap


We have not cultured dolphin fibroblasts before, therefore we do not know how
well they will grow in adherent culture or what their doubling times will be.


Method/procedure


Experimental Plan (Approximate timeline - we do not know how these cells will
grow so this is very prone to change, we will need to continually monitor for
confluence)  
D1: seed 562.5K into 1xT75 (7500 cells/cm2)  
D2: feed  
D5: passage into 2xT175 (assuming flask is at least 80% confluence, seed at
7500 cells/cm2 i.e. 1.3M per T175 flask)  
D8: feed  
D12: feed  
D13: passage 2xT175 into 1x 4CF (assuming flask is at least 80% confluence,
seed at 7500 cells/cm2, i.e. 1.9M per 4CF)  
D17: feed  
D21 bank 1 x 4CF
