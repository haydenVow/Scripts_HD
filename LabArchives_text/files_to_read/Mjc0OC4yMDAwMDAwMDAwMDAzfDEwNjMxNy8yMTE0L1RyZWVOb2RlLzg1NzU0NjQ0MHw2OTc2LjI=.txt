Blocking BufferM5703  
  
dPBSM5385  
  
Secondary Antibody (AF555 IgG2b)S1966  
  
Vimentin antibodyS716  
  
DAPI (1:1000)M2193  
  
  
  




Reagent preparation:

1\. Aliquotted    85 mL  PBS for washing

2\. Centrifuged the secondary antibody stock (AF555 IgG2b) using the benchtop
microcentrifuge for 10 seconds.

3\. Prepared Secondary Antibody mix (pipette from the top/supernatant of
antibody solution):

 6 µL   Secondary #1 AF555 (IgG2b)  (1:1000  ) +  5994  µL  Blocking Buffer
(PBST (0.1% Triton X + dPBS) + 3% BSA)  

Total volume required = 6 mL

If using AlexaFluor secondary antibodies then the max concentration should be
1:500 (typically used at 1:1000)

Pipette-mixed antibody mix and stored refrigerated away from light until
needed.

4\. Prepared Primary antibody mix (Vimentin)

 120 µL   Primary #1 Mouse Anti-Vimentin antibody- can be found in the -20'C
freezer in the second draw  (1:50  ) +  5880  µL  Blocking Buffer (PBST (0.1%
Triton X + dPBS) + 3% BSA)  

Total volume required = 6 mL

Pipette-mixed antibody mix and stored refrigerated away from light until
needed.

5\. Prepared DAPI (1:1000) mix:

  5994 uL  PBS +   6 uL  of DAPI

Total volume required = 6 mL  

Vortexed DAPI mix and stored refrigerated away from light until needed.

Process:

1\. Removed plate from the Staining and Fixing fridge (incubated in primary
antibodies overnight).

  1. Plate is labelled as MF20/Vimentin stain AK 08 July EPCI 20128

NOTE: from this step onwards protect from the light by wrapping plates in foil
and perform experiment in the dark.

2\. Washed 3 times for 5 min with PBS (500 uL per well) at RT.

 10:00 - 10:05

 10:06 - 10:11

 10:12 - 10:24

3\. Incubated the cells with secondary antibody mixture (300 uL per well) in
the dark at RT for 1 hour.  10:30 - 11:30




Counter staining

1\. Removed 2nd antibody solution.  11:30

2\. Wash each well with 500 uL dPBS

3\. Incubate each well with 300 uL of Vimentin primary antibody for 2 hrs at
room temperature   11:40 - 13:40  

4\. Wash each well with 500 uL dPBS

5\.  Washed with DAPI (1:1000) (300 uL per well) in PBS for 5 min at RT in the
dark.

 13:52 - 13:58

6\.  Washed in PBS 3 x 5 min at RT in the dark. (No Triton)

 14:00 - 14:05  

 14:08 - 14:13  

 14:14 - 14:19  

7\.  Replaced dPBS.

 14:25

8\. Parafilm the plate, wrap in foil (labelled) and store in the Fixing and
Staining fridge at 4'C. 14:30

9\. Confirmed staining on microscope by imaging on the Zaber (This will be
performed at a later date).

  1. Please note that you do not to image on the Zaber today

*Once this stage is reached please let Adrian know. 

  

Channels to observe immunofluorescence:

1\. AF555 for MuSC

2\. AF488 for fibroblast in the collagen matrix

3\. DAPI for cell nuclei




SOPs used:
