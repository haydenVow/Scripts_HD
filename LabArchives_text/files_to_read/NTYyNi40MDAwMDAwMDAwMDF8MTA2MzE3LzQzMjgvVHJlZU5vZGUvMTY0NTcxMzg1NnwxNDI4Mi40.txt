Graph 1: Plot graph of mean cell counts per feeding condition across 10 days
of differentiation for DOLLY12 cells 2% HS differentiation media. Error bars
show standard error. N = 4 for each data point.

  

Graph 2: Plot graph of mean cell counts per feeding condition across 10 days
of differentiation for DOLLY12 cells in E6 differentiation media. Error bars
show standard error. N = 4 for each data point.

  

  

Graph 3: Plot graph of mean MyoG counts per feeding condition across 10 days
of differentiation for DOLLY12 cells in 2% HS differentiation media. Error
bars show standard error. N = 4 for each data point.

  

  

Graph 4: Plot graph of mean MyoG counts per feeding condition across 10 days
of differentiation for DOLLY12 cells in E6 differentiation media. Error bars
show standard error. N = 4 for each data point.

Graph 5: Plot graph of mean percentage area of the well expressing MHC per
feeding condition across 10 days of differentiation for DOLLY12 cells in 2% HS
differentiation media. Error bars show standard error. N = 4 for each data
point.

  

Graph 6: Plot graph of mean percentage area of the well expressing MHC per
feeding condition across 10 days of differentiation for DOLLY12 cells in E6
differentiation media. Error bars show standard error. N = 4 for each data
point.
