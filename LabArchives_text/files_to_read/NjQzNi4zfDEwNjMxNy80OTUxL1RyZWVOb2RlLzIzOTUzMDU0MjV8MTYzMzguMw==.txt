Aim/Purpose


To determine whether there are differences in survival between the DOLLY12
MuSC MCB and WCB.


Hypothesis


The survival of DOLLY12 MuSC MCB will be greater than that of the DOLLY12 WCB
due to lower passage number.


Technical Gap


The observed cell death during Q3 and prior could be due to the senescence of
DOLLY12 MuSC as the cells may be reaching the Hayflick limit. This is
evidenced by the high passage number of most of the DOLLY12 MuSC used in the
experiments conducted during Q3

Method/Procedure


  1. [Experiment Plan]
    * 26 and 27 Oct 2021: Thaw DOLLY12 MCB and DOLLY12 WCB
    * 28-Oct-21: Passage DOLLY12 MCB and DOLLY12 WCB into 4 x 96 wp with DOLLY12 MCB cells in columns 5 and 6 and DOLLY12 WCB in columns 7 and 8.  

    * 30-Oct-21: 50% DMEM/F12 + 20% FBS + 1x P/S + p38i
    * D0D (1 Nov 2021): Once cells reach 100% confluence, fix 1 x DOLLY12 plate (whilst still in growth media) and change the remaining plates to E6 (columns 5 and 7) and 2% HS (columns 6 and 8) differentiation media as observed in the image below.  

    * D1D - 100% Feed
    * D2D - 100% Feed
    * D3D - 100% Feed
    * D4D - Fix 1 x DOLLY12 plate 
    * D4D - 100% Feed
    * D5D - 100% Feed
    * D6D - 100% Feed
    * D7D - Fix 1 x DOLLY12 plate 
    * D8D: 100% Feed
    * D9D: 100% Feed
    * D10D: Fix 1 x DOLLY12 plate 
    * DAPI stain Day 4, Day 7 and Day 10 fixed plates
    * Image and obtain total cell counts for Day 0, Day 4, Day 7 and Day 10 plates (ImageJ macro)
    * Determine the difference between Day 0, Day 4, Day 7 and Day 10 time points
    * Assess whether there are differences in cell survival between the DOLLY12 MCB and WCB.
