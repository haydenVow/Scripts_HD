5x, DAPI images of the centre of each well were used. The DAPI count macro on
MIA was used to process images.

ROUT method (Q=5%) was used to identify and exclude outliers.

* p≤ 0.05, ** p≤ 0.01, *** p≤ 0.001, **** p≤ 0.0001

Data from 96 well plate that was stained (i.e. these cells were not passaged):

Brown-Forsythe and Welch ANOVA was used to compare cell counts between
different conditions. n=5-6 for each condition.



Data from 24 well plate containing cells that were passaged:

At the 72 h time-point, the DAPI count macro did not perform well on all
conditions where cells were only stained for 1 h because the fluorescence was
very faint. Therefore, that data was not used for analysis.

Welch's t-test was used to compare the cell counts from the remaining
conditions. n=5-6 for each condition
