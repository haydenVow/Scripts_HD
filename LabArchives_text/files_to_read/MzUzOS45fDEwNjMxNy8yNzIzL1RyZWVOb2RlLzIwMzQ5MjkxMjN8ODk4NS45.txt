Media/Reagents used:

NameDetails (reagent ID)  
Blocking BufferM 5703  
  
dPBSM 5923  
  
Secondary Antibody (AF488 IgG1)S 1606  
  
DAPI (1:1000)M 2193  
  
  
  




Reagent preparation:

1\. Aliquotted    20 mL  dPBS for washing

2\. Centrifuged the secondary antibody stock (AF488 IgG1) using the benchtop
microcentrifuge for 10 seconds.

3\. Prepared Secondary Antibody mix (pipette from the top/supernatant of
antibody solution):

 2 µL   Secondary #1 AF488 (IgG1)  (1:1000  ) +  1998  µL  Blocking Buffer
(PBST (0.1% Triton X + dPBS) + 3% BSA)  

Total volume required = 2 mL

If using AlexaFluor secondary antibodies then the max concentration should be
1:500 (typically used at 1:1000)

Pipette-mixed antibody mix and stored refrigerated away from light until
needed.

4\. Prepared DAPI (1:1000) mix:

  2 uL  PBS +   1998 uL  of DAPI

Total volume required = 2 mL  

Vortexed DAPI mix and stored refrigerated away from light until needed.

Process:

1\. Removed plate from the Staining and Fixing fridge (incubated in primary
antibodies overnight).

  1. Plate is labelled as MyoG staining AK EPIC 20128

NOTE: from this step onwards protect from the light by wrapping the plate in
foil and perform experiment in the dark.

2\. Washed 3 times for 5 min with PBS (200 uL per well) at RT.

 11:36 - 11:41  

 11:42 - 11:47  

 11:47 - 11:52  

3\. Incubated the cells with secondary antibody mixture (100 uL per well) in
the dark at RT for 1 hour.  11:53 - 12:53 pm




Counter staining

1\. Removed 2nd antibody solution.  13:09

2\. Wash each well with 200 uL dPBS

3\.  Washed with DAPI (1:1000) (100 uL per well) in PBS for 5 min at RT in the
dark.

 13:12 - 13:17 pm  

4\.  Washed in PBS (200 uL per well) 3 x 5 min at RT in the dark. (No Triton)

 13:17 - 13:22  

 13:22 - 13:27

 13:27 - 13:32  

5\.  Replaced dPBS.

 13:34 pm  

6\. Parafilm the plate, wrap in foil (labelled) and store in the Fixing and
Staining fridge at 4'C. 13:36 pm  

7\. Confirmed staining on microscope by imaging on the Zaber (This will be
performed at a later date).

  1. Please note that you do not to image on the Zaber today

  

Channels to observe immunofluorescence:

1\. AF488 for MuSC

2\. DAPI for cell nuclei
