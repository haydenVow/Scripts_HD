Growth Media:

  * [x]  DMEM/F12 + 20% FBS + 1X P/S + P38i (10uM)

  

1\. Gelatin coated  3  x  T175  flasks/plates with sterile filtered 0.1%
gelatin solution and then incubated all coated flasks at 37ºC

  * Time when all flasks placed into the incubator at 15:39    

2\. Aliquoted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then
placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath for a minimum of 20 minutes
prior to use:

  *  Growth media (for seeding):    1x90mL in  1x120mL  containers
  * Time that aliquots were placed in the water bath to warm before use:  [16:00]   

  




## Thaw and seed vial:

3\. Collected the cryovial from Liquid Nitrogen storage & place in foam
floater in water bath for 5 min  16:50 - 16:55 a/pm

Location where cryovial was collected from:

Vial details:  1   cryovials at  500 K  cells each cell type below for a total
of    500K  cells per cell type.

`4. Ethanol sprayed & transferred the vial(s) to the BSC.`

`5.  Added  500µL of Growth Media (to generate a total volume of 1mL in the
cryovial) to the cryovial, resuspended the cell suspension gently to reduce
osmotic shock. `

`6. Collected the entire 1mL of cell suspension from the cryovial &
transferred to the  pre-warmed 90mL Growth Media aliquot.  `

`7. Using a 10mL serological pipette, resuspended & distributed the cells
evenly in each  90mL of pre-warmed Growth Media. `

`8. For each cell type, transferred  30 mL of cell suspension into each of 3
pre-coated  T175  flask after removing excess gelatin.`

`9. Allowed all flasks to rest in the BSC at RT for 30 min  ` 17:00-17:30 `  
`

`9. Transferred flasks to incubate at: `

  * [x]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (aviary cells)

  

Making labels

Note - You will need to increase the passage number by one. (i.e. if your
thawed vial ID has a passage number of 3, when you make a culture ID for you
vessel you will need change the passage number to 4 on Airtable.)
