Growth Media: CD CHO medium & CDM4Avian medium




Process:

  1. Aliquoted:
    1. 5 mL of CD CHO Medium
    2. 5 mL of CDM4Avian Medium 
      1. Placed in water bath:  14:23     

  2. Paused shakers by pressing the "play" button on the controller on the side wall of the incubator
  3. Collected culture vessel from shaker, wiped with ethanol-sprayed cloth and brought into BSC
  4. Pipetted suspensions though 70 um cell strainer into 2 x 50 mL tubes
  5. Took 1 x 500 uL sample from 15 mL cell suspension and followed procedure in entry below to count cells.
  6. Centrifuged at 300 x g for 5 min. Timestamp: 16:38 - 16:43
  7. Aspirated 25 mL of supernatant from each culture, taking care to not disrupt or aspirate pellet 
  8. Re-suspended cultures in 5 mL of CDM4Avian (NANDO) and CD CHO (DOLLY) using serelogical.
  9. Gently pipette-mixed cultures again before moving to 2 x 50 mL spin tubes
  10. Returned vessel to incubator. Pressed "play" and set speed to 206 RPM. Timestamp: 17:08

  * Incubator (#68), Lab [Main/Library/Production]




Stain and image:

  1. Took 100 uL samples of each culture, transferred to wells in 96 well plate
  2. Prepared stain buffer of equal volumes of NucBlue and NucGreen reagents (M6457)
  3. Added 10 uL of stain buffer to each well, pipet mixed each well
  4. Incubated at room temperature in the dark for 10-20 minutes 15:43 - 15:55
  5. Centrifuged at 650 RCF for 1 minutes   

  6. Took images of each well on the blue and green fluorescence channels using the Zaber on culture 7502 EPIC21187-EPIC22603, below correspond to wells in row A:
    1. Culture ID 7342
    2. Culture ID 7415
    3. Culture ID 7665

    5. Culture ID 7667
    6. Culture ID 7668
    7. Culture ID 7669
    8. Culture ID 7670
  7. Took 100 uL samples of each E125 culture, transferred to wells in 96 well plate
  8. Added 10 uL of stain buffer to each well, pipet mixed each well
  9. Incubated at room temperature in the dark for 10-20 minutes 17:11 - 17:21
  10. Centrifuged at 650 RCF for 1 minute
    1. Took images of each well on the blue and green fluorescence channels using the Zaber on culture 7502 EPIC21187-EPIC22603, listed below:
