Procedure


PASSAGING OF NUCLEOFECTED CELLS

1\. Took 1 x images of three wells from one plate of the Control and
PABPC1+CDKN1A groups.

2\. Aliquoted the required volume of each reagent below, placed all aliquots
to warm in the bead bath for a minimum of 20 minutes prior to use:

  1. TrypLE:  2mL per well 
  2.  dPBS (2mL for neutralising & 1mL for washing):  3mL per well 

3\. Tryle added to water bath at 9:54

Suspension cultures and adherent cultures were set up starting from 09:24am pm
by NH and EC. Cultures harvested for FACS sorting were passaged after lunch.  

  * [EC]   

  * [NH]   

The following passaging protocol was followed for each knockout/control group,
The supernatants from all wells was also collected at all steps prior to
centrifugation following neutralization of tryple. All conditions were kept in
separate tubes.

* * *

4\.  Collected culture supernatant and washed each well GENTLY with 1mL of
dPBS (warmed).  

5\. Collected dPBS wash with previous supernatant and added   2  mL tryple to
each well, cells were then incubated at 37˚C for 8 minutes.  

6\. Collected supernatants into 50mL tubes alongside previous supernatants and
empty wells were washed with  2 ml  of dPBS. dPBS washes were then also
collected.  

7\. Centrifuged collections at 400 x g for 5 min.  

8\. Aspirated and discarded the supernatant(s) from cell pellets.

9\. Using dPBS, Resuspended and combined pellets into one tube, taking care to
rinse out tubes with a small aliquot of dPBS. Total volumes of cell suspension
at this step for each cell pellet was 2mL.

10\. Aliquoted 10uL of cell suspension for counting using a hemocytometer,
mixing 1:5 with Trypan blue. *This step was not followed during FACS prep of
culture X , Cells were moved straight to FACS prep protocol after dPBS
resuspension.

11\. Cell suspensions were counted and total cell number was determined for
each group in the document below.

14\. Aliquoted the volumes of cell suspension listed for DNA extraction above
into individual 1.5mL tubes. Aliquoted the volumes above for suspension
cultures into 15mL tubes.




SETTING UP ADHERENT POOLED CULTURES

  1. Volumes of cell suspensions in dPBS listed above for adherent cultures were aliquoted directly into T75 flasks containing 12mL of growth media. 
  2. Flasks were left to incubate at 30 degrees, 5% CO2 (incubator #140 ) static. 

  




SETTING UP SUSPENSION POOLED CULTURES

  1. 15mL tubes containing cell suspensions were centrifuged at 500g for 5 minutes.
  2. Supernatant was removed from each tube and replaced with Hycell Cho basal media + KSR + FGF-b + IGF1-LR3 to a maximum final concentration of 1 million cells/mL (Minimum volume in each tube was 5mL). 
  3. Cells from each condition were then resuspended and transferred to separate 50mL bioreactor tubes. 
  4. Tubes were placed in incubator 82 (main lab), at 30 degrees C, 5% CO2, 1 x 50ml tube per condition shaking at 120 rpm for the first 24h and then placed on the 210 rpm shaker, and the remaining 50ml tube per condition directly placed on the 210rpm shaker. 

  




FACS SORTING SUSPENSION CELLS

  1. The collected cell suspension for each condition was transferred to a 1.5mL tube and centrifuged at 300g for 5 minutes. 
  2. Supernatant was removed. 
  3. Cells were resuspended in 500uL of FACS buffer 
  4. An esky box was packed for transport to the FACS facility 
    1. Pre-filled (medium) multi-well plates (8x96wp), parafilmed around the edges
    2. An ice pack
    3. Extra FACS Buffer prepared earlier. 
    4. 4x 0.22um filter capped tubes. 
  5. Once at the FACS facility: 
    1. Samples were passed though 0.22um filter lids into sample collection tubes
    2. A live dead stain was added to each of the sample tubes, 5uL of 7-AAD stain (invitrogen) 
    3. Cells from each condition were sorted into 2 x 96 well plates each containing adherent growth media, 1 cell per well (see FACS preparation for media compositions). 
  6. Plates were transported back to Vow and moved directly to the incubator at 30 degrees, 5% CO2 (Incubator number #140, library lab ) (17:38) 




FREEZING PELLETS FOR DNA EXTRACTION

  1. Added an additional 1mL of dPBS to each aliquot of cells taken for DNA extraction. 
  2. Centrifuged tubes at 500g for 5 minutes to pellet cells. 
  3. Removed supernatant from each tube then added all tubes to a yellow lid pot labelled with the epic number and date. 
  4. Stored cell pellets at −20°C in the bottom shelf of the freezer in library lab. 

  

  




## Observations

  




## Reference Images.

the top 3 wells of all plates were inspected under the microscope and imaged,
1 image per well. No abnormal morphology was seen. All wells were 95-100%
confluent at the time of passage. There were no obvious differences in cell
morphology evident between groups during this inspection.
