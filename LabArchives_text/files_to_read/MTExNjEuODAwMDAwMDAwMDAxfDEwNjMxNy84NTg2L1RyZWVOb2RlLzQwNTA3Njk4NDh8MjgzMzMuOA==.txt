Aim / Goal


To seed "Pork bun" gel to determine the following:

\- Effect of vit C in media

\- Addition of a secondary material

ULTIMATE GOAL: Cells to survive in biomaterials and hopefully proliferate.


Hypothesis


I believe the cells can proliferate through the gel when kept in a suspension
form on a shaker to increase perfusion throughout the scaffold.

Things to be mindful of:

\- Scaffold to media concentration

\- Perfusion throughout scaffold

\- Cell clustering and necrotic cores


Protocol


Pork Bun Gel Creation

  1. Weigh out all biomaterial powders (see below) and combine together into a homogenous powder.
    1. 2% (w/v) Low viscosity alginate
    2. 2% (w/v)  Metho cellulose (Sigma Aldrich Brand)
    3. 1% (w/v) Xanthan Gum
    4. 1% (w/v) Glucomannan
  2. Hydrate various biomaterials to required volume in PBS. Stir with a spatula until mostly dissolved. If clumps form, try pushing against the side of the jar.
  3. Leave for 1hr in room temperature
  4. Stir to ensure a homogenous biogel, incorporate air in to form bubbles
  5. Autoclave for 30 mins at 121C on liquid setting. Or pressure cook at similar settings with water in pan.
  6. Refrigerate remaining gel overnight at 4C.

Cell Seeding Protocol - FOR PORK BUN GEL

  1. Add growth factors to the growth media. 
  2. Place growth media aliquot in the waterbath (37C) for minimum 20 minutes
  3. Bring other reagents and biogel to RT for 1 hour. 
  4. Perform cell count. Density for experiments: 20 million cells / mL (required density to be proven). 
  5. Passage cells. Put required cell volume into 50mL centrifuge tubes.
  6. Centrifuge cell suspension for 5 mins at 500g.
  7. Based on cell count, use c1V1=c2V2 to determine amount of biogel required.
  8. Using a 5 mL syringe, stir biogel and draw up required amount and transfer to sterile specimen jar.
  9. Remove supernatant from cells, resuspend in media (~30uL / mL of biogel). Transfer to biogel in jar with a 1mL pipette, slowly stirring into ink as you do. Make sure to get into tip of cartridge and that it entirely incorporated (~1.5 min).
  10. Draw up into a syringe and add to anchor moulds in a 24WP.
  11. Add CaCl2 solution (100mM) to drops and crosslink for 15 mins.
  12. Following crosslink, remove scaffolds with anchor moulds to a 6 well plate.
  13. Wash scaffolds in media at RT according to this:
    1. 1x 1 min wash
    2. 1x 5 min wash
    3. x 10 min wash at 37 C
  14. After scaffolds are washed of all excess CaCl2, culture in media.
  15. Leave for 1 day prior to feeding to ensure stabilisation of construct.
  16. Feed according to schedule.

Cell Seeding Protocol - FOR SECONDARY MATERIAL CONSTRUCTS

Preparing secondary materials

  1. Using a sterile biopsy punch cut 5mm wide discs from material sheets, or alternatively aliquot some of the secondary material powder into a beaker.
  2. Place in 50mL of PBS and autoclave for 30 mins. 
  3. Remove PBS and replace with fresh PBS, wash by gentle swirling and remove PBS. Replace with RPMI/HiCell (50:50) media.

Seeding secondary materials (Sheets or chips)

  1. Place a hole punch of each material into a single well each of a 24WP.
  2. Perform cell count. Density for experiments: 20 million cells / mL (required density to be proven). 
  3. Passage cells. Put required cell volume into 50mL centrifuge tubes.
  4. Centrifuge cell suspension for 5 mins at 500g.
  5. Based on cell count, use c1V1=c2V2 to determine amount of biogel required.
  6. Using a 5 mL syringe, stir biogel and draw up required amount and transfer to sterile specimen jar.
  7. Remove supernatant from cells, resuspend in media (~30uL / mL of biogel). Transfer to biogel in jar with a 1mL pipette, slowly stirring into ink as you do. Make sure to get into tip of cartridge and that it entirely incorporated (~1.5 min).
  8. Draw up into a syringe and add to anchor moulds in a 24WP.
  9. Add CaCl2 solution (100mM) to drops and crosslink for 15 mins.
  10. Following crosslink, remove scaffolds with anchor moulds to a 6 well plate.
  11. Wash scaffolds in media at RT according to this:
    1. 1x 1 min wash
    2. 1x 5 min wash
    3. x 10 min wash at 37 C
  12. After scaffolds are washed of all excess CaCl2, culture in media.
  13. Leave for 1 day prior to feeding to ensure stabilisation of construct.
  14. Feed according to schedule.

Seeding Vit C Condition

**Repeat method for seeding pork bun gel, however dose final culture media
with 50ug/mL of Vitamic C (Ascorbic Acid)**

Feeding Schedule

Everyday feeds

  1. Take 3 images at 5x and 3 images at 10x
  2. Check for signs of contamination.
  3. Remove 50% of RPMI/HiCell (50:50) and replace with 50% fresh RPMI/HiCell (50:50) every day.

Staining Protocol

Hoechst 33342 /Propidium Iodide

  1. Transfer scaffolds to to a 24 WP on days 0, 3, 7
  2. Remove any excess media.
  3. Add in fresh media with 2 ug/mL of Hoechst and 2 ug/mL Propidium Iodide.
  4. Incubate for 15 mins on a shaker plate.
  5. Remove media and wash 2x with PBS.
  6. Replace with fresh PBS and image on Zaber.

Observations/Notes


During autoclaving of the biogel, it changed colour to a dark amber from its
initial translucent beige. Thickness and consistency also changed, when hot it
will be the consistency of semi firm fetta (not a great comparison), while
when it cooled to room temperature it was similiar to marmalade without the
stickinesss, when cooled further to 4C it become more liquidy.

Trying to syringe up the gel was highly difficult and an accurate volume could
not be achieved. Suggest for future experiments to determine the density and
measure out volumes by weight instead.

Using large number of cells (160 million) contributes to a large amount of the
suspension volume. This will need to be taken into account when determining
the final dilution of the biogel, or when attempting to resuspend the cells in
the gel.

Gel did not adhere to secondary components well, for future experiments we
will need to incorporate it as part of a mould.
