RELATED TO MILESTONE:  MS3B

AIM/PURPOSE: To assess the suitability of  electrospun gelatin and zein
scaffolds for promoting MuSC adhesion and adhesion maintenance after 14 days
of differentiation in animal component free (ACF) cell culture conditions.

HYPOTHESIS:  Electrospun zein and zein/gluten scaffolds will support a
scaffold confluence of â‰¥ 60% after 7 days in ACF differentiation media.

RESULTS SUMMARY: See Report

CONCLUSIONS: Electrospun Zein and Zein/Gluten scaffolds in their current form
are not promising candidates for further development. The Zein/gluten
scaffolds were too fragile to be lifted from the plate, and subsequently image
analysis could not be performed on these samples. The zein material shrunk to
about 1/10th of it's original size within 24hrs of exposure to cell culture
conditions (37'C, 5% CO2 in growth media). The change in the zein scaffold
morphology negatively impacted the accuracy of imaging. Despite the
limitations with zein, a high scaffold confluence of >65% was seen on these
scaffolds by d14 in differentiation medium.

NEXT STEPS: Based on this experiment, in addition to the sensory tasting of
zein and electrospun zein in alginate, we have decided not to pursue zein as a
scaffold material any further. Discussions will be held with Matrix Meats to
investigate alternative scaffold materials. Feedback has been provided to
Matrix Meats in the form of a report and suggestions for future scaffolds,
including increased stability and thickness have been requested.
