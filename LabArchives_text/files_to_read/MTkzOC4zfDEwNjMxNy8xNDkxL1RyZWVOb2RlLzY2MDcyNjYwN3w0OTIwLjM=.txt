RELATED TO MILESTONE:  KR2 Maturation: Have live cells growing in a v2
bioreactor that supports perfusion and demonstrates improved fusion and/or
maturation beyond the v1 bioreactor

AIM/PURPOSE: To determine the effect of gelatin on fusion and maturation in
C2C12 cells.

HYPOTHESIS: A high concentration of gelatin (20 mg/ml) will prove detrimental
to fusion and maturation of C2C12 cells compared to cells with no gelatin
added. The optimal concentration of gelatin for fusion and maturation will be
5 mg/mL

RESULTS SUMMARY: See Final Report.

CONCLUSIONS: What were the overall findings? This should be a concise summary
and not duplicate the information in the results/report. For example "We found
that Bovine MuSCs could only achieve a cell density 50% of that observed with
planar culture without undergoing precocious differentiation. These results
mean that we are currently limited to X cells/ml in suspension culture until
we find a way to inhibit precocious differentiation"

NEXT STEPS: This should be a dot point list of any immediate outcomes, changes
to SOPs, as well as providing a direct link to any new experiments arising
from these findings. Importantly, this section should also include any
potential DEPLOYMENTS to the production team
