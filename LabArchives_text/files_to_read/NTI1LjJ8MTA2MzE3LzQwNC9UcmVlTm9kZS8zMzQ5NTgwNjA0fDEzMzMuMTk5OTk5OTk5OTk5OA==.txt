Process:

1\. Added 2 mL of E6 media to each well of a 24WP. Placed in incubator  14:00

2\. Retrieved culture plate from incubator. Using a gloved, well-ethanoled
hand, carefully lift the inserts by the edges

3\. Placed inserts with zein scaffolds into new 24WP with warmed E6 medium.
Use plate from previous plate for new culture to avoid re-printing culture ID
label.

4\. Returned vessel to incubate at:

  * [X]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (aviary cells)

  

  * [X]  Thermo Incubator (ID #13)
  * [ ]  Top Sanyo Incubator (ID #25)
  * [ ]  Bottom Sanyo Incubator
  * [ ]  Top Binder Incubator
  * [ ]  Bottom Binder Incubator
