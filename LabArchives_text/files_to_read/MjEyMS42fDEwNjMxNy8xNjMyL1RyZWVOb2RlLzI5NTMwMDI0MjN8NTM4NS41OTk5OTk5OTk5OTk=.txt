Process:

1\. Aliquotted   3mL  mL of  Growth Media into   1    tube(s). Placed in water
bath  10:25-10:45

2\. Removed  500ul  of supernatant from vessel.

3\. Replaced with  0.5 mL (per well) of  Growth   media.

4\. Returned vessel to incubate at: 10:50

  * [ X]  37ÂºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * Incubator (#77  ), Lab [Library]




### Observations/Summary:

 100 % media changed on vessel(s)

  1. 6965-F_DOLLY12-Sheep P1-1of1

  




Note: Unpicked clones were retained in 24 well plate for continued monitoring.

for picking details. Remaining clones were given a media change of 500ul
DMEM/F12 +20% FBS + 1xp/s today.




### Results

  * Results were;
    * [ X ]  As Usual (this is a repetitive task)
    * [ ]  Unexpected because...
    * [ ]  Need to be further analysed
    * [ ]  Other (.......)
