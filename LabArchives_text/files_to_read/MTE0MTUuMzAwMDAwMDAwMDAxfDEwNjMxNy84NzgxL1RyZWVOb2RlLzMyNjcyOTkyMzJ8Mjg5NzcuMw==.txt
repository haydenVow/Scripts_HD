## Steps

  1. Weigh out the required amounts of powdered reagents in specimen containers (separately). These reagents include:  
    * Hycell CHO basal medium powder 
    * Sodium Bicarbonate 
    * Poloxamer 188 (skip if it is reconstituted as a concentrated stock mix). 
    * NOTE: Record the reagent ID of each component, to make the final mix ID on Ranger.  
  

  2. Bring the 3 specimen containers containing the powder reagents as well as the liquid reagents into the BSC.
    1. Liquid reagents include: 
      1. Pluronic (if it has been reconsititued into a concentrated solution mix). 
      2. Anti Clumping Agent (ACA)
      3. Penicillin/ Streptomycin (P/S)
      4. Glutamax (GLUT)    
  

  3. Dissolve the Hycell CHO powder in MilliQ. (alone). 
    1. Dissolve the HyCell CHO powder (alone) in half the total volume of MilliQ required for the total volume of growth media being made up. 
      1. e.g If you are making up 1L of Hycell CHO growth medium, dissolve the media in 0.5L.
    2. Advice: slowly add the Hycell powder to the 0.5L of milliQ in a schott bottle to prevent clumping. Also, use a weight boat as 'funnel' to prevent powder loss. Alternatively, with large mass of powder you can create a funnel with the weigh paper to prevent powder loss when pouring powder from a container.  
  

  4.  With a serological pipette take up some of this Hycell cho solution and dissolve the sodium bicarbonate before dispensing it into the sterile filter unit.  
  

  5. Repeat the step 4 for the poloxamer 188 by taking some of the Hycell solution and adding it to the specimen container containing the poloxamer powder. 
    1. NOTE It does not dissolve easily, so add a magnetic stirrer into the urine pot, remove it from the BSC, and leave it on the stirring plate for about 10 minutes. DO NOT try to dissolve it in media by pipetting up and down as the powder will get stuck inside the pipette trip/ serological. 
    2. Alternatively, make up a concentrated stock solution ahead of time to aliquot into the solution as a liquid component.  
  

  6. Add the liquid reagents while you are waiting for the poloxamer to dissolve. 
    1. Liquid reagents include ACS, P/S, and GLUT.  
  

  7. Once the poloxamer is completely dissolved, wipe down the urine pot containing it and introduce it into the BSC. Add it to the solution.  


  8. Using MiillQ, top up the schott bottle to the total volume of growth medium you aim to make. 
    1. For example, if you are making up 1L of Hycell CHO growth medium, dissolve/ mix in 0.5-0.7L of MilliQ, then after top up to the 1L.  
  

  9. Pour solution into a filter unit (0.22um).*  
  

  10. Connect the pump to the sterile filter unit.  
  

  11. Place in the fridge (4C) until use.  

*Note, sterile filter units can filter up to 3L.
