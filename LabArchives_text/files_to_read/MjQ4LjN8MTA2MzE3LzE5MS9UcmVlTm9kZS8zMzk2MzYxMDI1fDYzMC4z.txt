Process:

Please observe rows B+ F under florescence (DAPI channel). If you can see
anything, please take a few images of 1 sample in each row at both 5x and 10x  

1\. Remove pre-pared aliquots from the fridge. Placed in water bath
10:12-10:22

2\. Removed  100  % of supernatant from vessel.

3\. Replaced with  200 uL (per well/per vessel) of E6 media.

4\. Returned vessel to incubate at: 10:25

  * [x ]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (aviary cells)

  

  * [ X]  Thermo Incubator (ID #13)
  * [ ]  Top Sanyo Incubator (ID #25)
  * [ ]  Bottom Sanyo Incubator
  * [ ]  Top Binder Incubator

### Results

No flouresence was observed in unstained wells. Residual staining was clear in
both hoechst and dapi stained cells. Dapi treated wells appeared to be stained
indicating that not only dead cells took up the stain. Some cells were much
brighter however, which may be the true dead cells.
