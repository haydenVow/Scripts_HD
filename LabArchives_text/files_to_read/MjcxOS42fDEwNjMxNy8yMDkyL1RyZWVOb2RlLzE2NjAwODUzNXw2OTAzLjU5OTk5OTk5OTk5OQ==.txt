Process:

  1. Aliquotted  1 x 15 mL and 1 x 30 mL of  growth Media into  2 x 50 mL    falcon tubes(s). 
  2. Placed medium aliquot in water bath   11:35 - 13:25     

  3. Stopped the shaker and removed cultures from the incubator before restarting the shaker   13:25    

  4. Placed suspension flask(s) inside the BSC and allowed to sit static for 3-5 minutes to allow microcarriers to settle to the base of the flask. 
  5. Carefully removed  50  % of supernatant from the flask(s) by pipetting slowly and following the meniscus with the pipette tip so as to avoid placing the pipette tip near the microcarriers at the base of the flask(s). 
  6. Replaced with  15 mL (per well/per vessel) of   growth  media for the E125 (7233) and replaced with  30 mL (per well/per vessel) of   growth  media for the E250 (7234). 
  7. Stopped the shaker and returned vessel to incubate at:   13:35  , incubator #  68  before restarting the shaker

### Observations/Summary:

 50 % media changed on vessel(s)

  1. In the E250 planar culture flask a large amount of white macroscopic particles/strands were noticed. This was sampled and stained. The 30 ml waste media was placed in a 50 mL falcon tube and put in the incubator on a shaker plate at 206 rpm. The E250 was topped up with another 30 mL growth media.
