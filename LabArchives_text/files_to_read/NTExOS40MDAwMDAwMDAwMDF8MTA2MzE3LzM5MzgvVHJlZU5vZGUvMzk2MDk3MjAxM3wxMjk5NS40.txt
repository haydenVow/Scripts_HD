Process:

  1. Check cells under phase setting on the microscope. Note down any differences between the two column in the observation. - take images if there are differences seen. 
  2. Aliquotted  3.5 mL  mL of E6 and D/F + 2%HS media each. 
  3. Placed in water bath 14:20 
  4. Removed  100  % of supernatant from vessel. 
  5. Replaced column 6 with  140 ul (per well/per vessel) of  E6   media.
  6. Replaced column 7 with  140 ul (per well/per vessel) of  D/F + 2%HS   media. 
  7. Returned vessel to the respective incubate at: 14:46

### Observations/Summary:

100  % media changed on vessel(s)

  1. 7986-DOLLY12-Sheep P13-1of3
  2. 7987-DOLLY12-Sheep P13-2of3
  3. 7988-DOLLY12-Sheep P13-3of3   
  
No obvious differences between the three plates except that the sanyo plates
appeared more confluent (by eye) compared to the thermo equivalent. No cell
death :)
