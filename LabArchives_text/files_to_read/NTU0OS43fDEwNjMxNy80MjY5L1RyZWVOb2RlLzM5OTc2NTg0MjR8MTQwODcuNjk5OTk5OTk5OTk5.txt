The background for this continuing project has been described in previous
quarters Q2 and Q3 and is applicable for this quarter as well. Additional
literature is attached below

 Q4 efforts will focus on:

  1. solving the cell delamination issues observed in Q3 which made analysis of the maturing muscle impossible
  2. improving the e-stim infrastructure to produce a more robust plate lid with Pt electrodes, possibly also increasing the number of stimulation patterns tested
  3. encapsulate cells in a hydrogel at high density (>10M cells/mL) to avoid delamination and replicate results from below japanese paper (striations and alignment of myotubes produced!!)
