4 clones were passaged to fresh wells on a 96 well plate, 1/5 of culture.

Briefly,

  1. Clones on culture 12667 were imaged using the primovert microscope, 5x objective
  2. clones that appeared <90% confluent were washed with dPBS
  3. 100uL of tryple was added and cells were incubated for 15 minutes at 30 degrees
  4. 20uL of cell suspension was transferred to a fresh well on a new 96 well plate containing 200uL of growth media (DMEM/F12+20% FBS + 1xP/S) 
  5. culture was returned to incubate at 30 degrees, 5% CO2. (culture 12770)

As there are only 4 ongoing clones these clones will be expanded to a 24 well
plate on next passage.
