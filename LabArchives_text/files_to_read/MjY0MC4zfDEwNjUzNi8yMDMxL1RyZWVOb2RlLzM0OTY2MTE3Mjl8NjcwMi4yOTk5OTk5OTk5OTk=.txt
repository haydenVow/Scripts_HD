Topped up media from 60L to 180L (added 120L)  

Performed by: LP/SR/AK

  * 200L palletank bag (with M13295) was initially checked for any microbial contamination as a QC precaution. No contamination was observed. 
  * In-tubing from palletank bag (3/8" \- 5/8") was welded onto the dip tube (3/8" \- 5/8") of the 200L STR. Pumpable tubing was inserted into the peristaltic pump

Start time: 11:33

End time: 15:50

Pump speed: 10.0 rpm to start (this was gradually increased as the volume
increased), ended on 30.0 rpm  
  
New Method: Heated media with water bath as it was going into the STR200

*This was not performed

  * Filled a bucket with water and Trigene
  * Heated water in the bucket to 60'C using a sousvide stick
  * Coiled up tubing on the sterile end of the filter and put it in the water bucket, making sure to avoid connections (with the exception of biowelded joins)
  * The pumped media through. (Could pump a little faster because of the heating)  
  
  
Media ID: M13295 (stored in a palletank bag since 02/08)  
Media type: 50:50 RPMI:CHOin1 (+glucose + L-glutamine)  
Filter used: No filter used. Media was pumped directly from the palletank bag
into the 200L STR  
New Density: 252512 cells/mL

Growth Factor mix: M13306

IGF: 120 mL

EGF: 24 mL

Antifoam C: 12 mL

L-glutamine: 1786 mL

Combined all reagents in a 2L corning bottle for addition into the 200L STR

  

New Method: Used a 2L dip tube lid to attach to the STR200 tubing to pump in
the growth factor mix. This worked well.  
  
Growth factors pumped in at: 16:40




Reset totalizer for the base pump (WI830). Recording on the weight scale was
11.189 kg.
