Note

Cell numbers had dropped significantly today indicating that the additional
yeast extract as well as essential AA added at the previous feed were not
successful in kickstarting proliferation, and may even have been detrimental
to the cells. As the total cell number in the CDM4 Avian culture has now
dropped below 50,000, they will not be continued beyond this point. A feed was
therefore performed only on the culture containing the standard Nuvonis media
(without FGF, additional yeast or amino acids), along with peptide antagonists
100ng/mL YIGSR and RGD.

Justification for the addition of YIGSR and RGD  
Up until today, cell counts have remained relatively stable for the past 10
days, and cells have a healthy morphology. Cell survival, without
proliferation is unusual, and not something we have commonly seen in our
previous suspension adaption experiments at Vow, where cells typically develop
a stressed morphology, produce a considerable amount of debris and
consistently decline in numbers. The cells therefore surviving, but appear to
be in cell cycle arrest. In some instances, cell survival in suspension is
mediated by G1/GS, which confers anoikis resistance. If this freeze in the
cell cycle is initiated due to a lack adhesion, then it may be possible to
circumvent this by mimicking adhesion is suspension culture, ie with synthetic
binding peptides such as YIGSR and RGD. In order to determine if the cell
cycle arrest is reversible, we will also plate a small number of cells into a
single well of a 96 well plate, in OptiPRO + 4mM Glutamax (original planar
culture media for these cells prior to suspension adaption) and monitor for
proliferation.

YIGSR and RGD are well characterised peptides derived from the ECM proteins,
laminin and fibronectin and are involve in cell adhesion to the ECM through
integrin binding [1]. Synthetic YIGSR and RGD are commonly used to promote
cellular attachment to culture vessels and other biomaterials [2] however they
can also be employed to prevent cellular adhesion in suspension cultures. When
media is supplemented with soluble YIGSR and/or RGD, cell attachment receptors
can become saturated and adhesion is inhibited [3, 4].  Whole protein
fibronectin and laminin in media do not inhibit cell attachment. This is
thought to be due to the low affinity of the large molecules to cells. Small
peptides of YIGSR and RGD are highly soluble and are therefore more able to
bind to cells in suspension [3].

Process:  

  1. Place media in water bath >15min prior to use
  2. Collected E125s from shaker, wiped with ethanol-sprayed Rediwipe, and brought into BSC 
  3. Using a 25 mL serological pipette, gently pipette-mixed culture for a few minutes to break up cell clumps
  4. Passed 5-7 times through 20G needle to break up cell clumps
  5. Transfer suspension into 50 mL tubes.
  6. Centrifuged 50 mL tubes at 300 x g for 5 mins 
  7. Aspirated  75% (15 mL) of supernatant, taking extra care to not disrupt or aspirate pellet.
  8. Resuspended each pellet in the remaining 5mL of media, and took 2x 10ul samples from each culture for hemocytometer counts 
  9. Performed  hemocytometer counts (see below for counts).
  10. Topped up each 50 mL centrifuge tube with 15 mL of fresh pre-warmed media and resuspended cell pellet. 
  11. Pipette-mixed cultures, and transfer all cultures to E250 flask
  12. Took a 100ul sample and plated into a single well of a 96 well plate, along with 100ul of OptiPro media +4mM glutamax. 
  13. Returned E250 to incubator
