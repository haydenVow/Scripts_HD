### Process:

1\. Took image of vessel with microscope on phase setting.

3\. Aliquotted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then
placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath for a minimum of 20 minutes
prior to use:

  1. TrypLE:      6.5   mL in     1    tubes
  2.  dPBS (for washing and neutralising):     13  mL
  3. Growth media (for pellet resuspension and seeding):      2x 6  mL 

Time that all aliquots were placed in the water bath the warm before use
11:32  

Note: if aliquots were placed in water bath at different time, record the time
stamp for each individual solution.




4\. Removed vessel(s) from the incubator   11:38  

5\. Washed the vessel(s) with dPBS (warmed).

6\. Added     3    mL tryple to each vessel/well and incubated at 37˚C.

  1. Start/Finish for TrypLE was    11:47 - 12:07   .   

7\. Neutralised with    3 mL   dPBS and combined cell suspension into a    15
mL     tube for each flask.

8\. Centrifuged at 650 x g for 5 min.

  1. Start/Finish time for centrifugation was     12:11   \-   12:16     




9\. Aspirated the supernatant(s).

10\. Resuspended pellet(s) in     0.5    mL for clone 1A16, 1 mL for clone 4C4
using    growth     media  

11\. Aliquoted      10 uL    of resuspended cells into a microcentrifuge tube
for cell count.

12\. Performed a cell count using the haemocytometer and recorded the cell
count data in the Google Doc spreadsheet: Cell Count Spreadsheet or cell count
widget below

  1. Total cell number was: 
    1. 4C4:     948 000  cells       

    2. 1A16:      122 000   cells.    

  2. Volume of cell suspension required for subculture was: 
    1. 4C4:    185   uL     

    2. 1A16:   all   uL      

  3. Cell density per vessel:     175 000 cells per flask (7000 cells/cm^2) for 4C4, 4480 cells/cm^2 for 1A16      




13\. Transferred    175 000 cells or 122 000 cells to the pre-warmed      5
mL Growth media:  

14\. Transferred cell suspension into        1x T25    for each clone.

16\. Transferred vessel(s) to incubate at:   12 : 48  

  * [X]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells), incubator #78  

  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (avian cells)
