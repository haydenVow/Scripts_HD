RELATED TO MILESTONE:  KR2 Maturation: Have live cells growing in a v2
bioreactor that supports perfusion and demonstrates improved fusion and/or
maturation beyond the v1 bioreactor

AIM/PURPOSE: To determine what concentration of creatine is able to promote
more fusion in DOLLY12 myoblast.  

HYPOTHESIS: That the addition of creatine into our existing differentiation
media is able to promote more fusion of DOLLY12 myoblast compared to
differentiation media without.

RESULTS SUMMARY: See Report

CONCLUSIONS: We found that addition of creatine had a positive effect on
DOLLY12 MuSC. In particular, at concentrations above 5mM creatine in E6 media,
longer myotube formation was evident, with 9 mM creatine concentration showing
the greatest (longer) myotube formation.

NEXT STEPS:

  * Re-do test with C2C12 to validate that creatine is effective in more than one cell line 
  * Re-do test at higher concentrations of creatine to test whether more creatine results in better myotube formation
