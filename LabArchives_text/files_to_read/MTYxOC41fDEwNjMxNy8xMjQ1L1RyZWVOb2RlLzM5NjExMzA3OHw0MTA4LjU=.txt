# Procedure

  1. Original Plates were removed from the incubator and transferred into the BSC 
  2. 80 wells on 4 x 24-well plates (Wash Plate 1) were pre-filled with 2 ml of PBS per well (1 well for each sample to be fixed and stained)
  3. WASH 1: The tray containing all inserts was lifted out of the original plate and placed into the fresh pre-filled PBS plate (Wash Plate 1). The samples were incubated in PBS at room temp, 5 min  15:36 - 15:42
    1. All remaining media in the original plate was aspirated to waste and the plate was disposed of. The lid was used to cover and label the fixed samples.
  4. WASH 2: A second PBS wash was performed by removing the tray from the plate and placing it into a new plate (Wash Plate 2) prefilled with 2 mL PBS, incubated for 5 min  15:42 - 15:50
    1. The first PBS wash was aspirated from Wash Plate 1 and replaced with 2 mL of 4% PFA
  5. PFA FIXING: The tray containing all inserts was lifted out of Wash Plate 2 and placed back into Wash Plate 1 (now containing PFA), incubated for 15 min  15:53 - 16:18
    1. All remaining media in Wash Plate 2 was aspirated to waste



  1. In the meantime, a 120 mL pot wrapped with foil was filled with 80 mL of PBS
  2. 80 uL of DAPI (1000x stock aliquots from freezer) was added (final conc.1 ul / ml).
  3. Wash Plate 2 was prefilled with 2 mL of DAPI solution and covered with foil until use.
  4. DAPI STAIN: The tray containing all inserts was lifted out of Wash Plate 1 and placed back into Wash Plate 2 (now containing DAPI), incubated for 5 min  16:19 - 16:24
    1. All remaining PBS in Wash Plate 1 was aspirated to waste. 2 mL of fresh PBS was added into each well of Wash Plate 1.
  5. WASH 1: The tray containing all inserts was lifted out of Wash Plate 2 and placed back into Wash Plate 1 (now containing PBS), incubated for 5 min  16:25 - 16:30
    1. All remaining PBS in Wash Plate 2 was aspirated to waste. 2 mL of fresh PBS was added into each well of Wash Plate 2.
  6. WASH 2: The tray containing all inserts was lifted out of Wash Plate 1 and placed back into Wash Plate 2 (now containing PBS), incubated for 5 min  16:31 - 16:36
    1. All remaining PBS in Wash Plate 1 was aspirated to waste. 2 mL of fresh PBS was added into each well of Wash Plate 1.
  7. FINAL WASH/STORAGE: The scaffold pieces were retrieved from Wash Plate 2 and placed into Wash Plate 1 (now containing PBS), incubated for 5 min  16:38




Imaging

  1. After incubation, the plate was placed under the Axiovert microscope for imaging under the DAPI channel, 5x/10x objective
  2. 3x images were captured for each well and write notes on observations in the table below - copy and paste images and details below
  3. The plate was covered with foil and stored until images were deemed final




# Cleanup of cups and trays

  1. The tray and inserts were separated and placed into a Tupperware containing diluted eucalyptus (not into the sink as the small baskets will float around).
  2. The eucalyptus was drained from the tupperware and cups and inserts were rinsed well with tap water.
  3. Once the tray and inserts were dry, they were place into an autoclave bag, tape closed with autoclave tape and place in the autoclave for a 20 min 'normal run' at 121'C.
  4. Once completed, tray and inserts were left in the autoclave bag until further use
