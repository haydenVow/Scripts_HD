Process:

  1. Add water containing red dye using the following volumes from D1 to D6 of a 24 well plate:
    1. 2.5 mL , 3 mL , 3.5 mL , 4 mL, 4.5 mL , 5 mL
  2. Cover plate with adhesive cover. 
  3. Place plate on shaker at 300 rpm and observe




Observations/Summary:

See video below

We will move forward with 2.5 mL at 300 rpm.

Liquid gets close to the top (but likely doesn't touch the top) when the
volume is 5 mL.

The incubator wobbles quite a bit and the plates move on the platform so we
would should secure them down.
