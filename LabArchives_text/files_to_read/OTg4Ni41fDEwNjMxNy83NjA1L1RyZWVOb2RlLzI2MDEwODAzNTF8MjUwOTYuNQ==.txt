In a meeting with Alex & Marie from Vow Foods, they discussed a new sample
type they are interested in analysis.  The samples are the pellet after TCA-
Acetone precipitation of the culture media.  They are getting around 100g/L.
The cultures are crocodile cell lines with 20% FCS. FCS is ~4g/L protein, so
would contribute only ~0.8g/L to what is in the sample. The rest is proteins
either secreted by the cell lines or release by cell lysis during culture.
They are stimulating the cells with TGF-beta and vitamin C to promote the
secretion of extracellular matrix proteins, and ECM proteins are of particular
interest.

Marie dropped off 3 samples:

1\. Pellet from unused Cell culture media aka Fresh. 2.04g wet weight.

2\. Pellet crocodile culture aka Waste. 2.49g wet weight.

  

A small amount was weighted out, the tubes were weighed, then left to air dry
for ~10 min at room temp and re-weighed. Urea/tris solution was added to give
a 10mg/ml solution.

The tubes were vortexed for 1 min and the sonicated for 5 min. The solutions
appeared clear but were centrifuged at 16,000g for 10 min at 20'C in case of
any undissolved material.

Samples were reduced (final DTT conc 10 mM) incubated at RT for 1 hr, and
alkylated (final IAA conc 25mM) incubated in darkness at RT for 30 mins. 50 uL
was removed and diluted with 250 uL 50 mM Ammonium Bicarbonate. 41.5 uL 12
ng/uL trypsin was added and the samples were incubated overnight in the
thermomix at 37C at 1000 rpm.

Undigested samples underwent a qubit. Needs a new overnight digest.

The new digest was set up at a higher trypsin:protein ration of 1:50 rather
thatn ~1:100. Approx 2 ug of reduced and alkylated sample was diluted into 25
uL 50mM AmBic. 3.33 uL of trypsin (12 ng/uL) was added and the samples
incubated overnight.

21/01/22

Samples were acidified to approx 0.1% TFA and 1.3 ug was cleaned up via
ziptip. These were dried and reconstituted into 10 uL LB, sonicated for 2 mins
prior to loading 3 uL onto the HFX3.  The pre-run SST were not perfect, so
samples were keep in the autosampler over the weekend and a new column was
installed on Monday.

The samples were processed via the emPAI route with PD 2.5 used to convert the
.raw files to .mgf:

The Mascot 2.8 was used to search the RefSeq Croc database:

The fresh sample as failing on the purcolator step (not unusual for samples
with fewer that 200 proteins), so the search was repeated with a fixed value
