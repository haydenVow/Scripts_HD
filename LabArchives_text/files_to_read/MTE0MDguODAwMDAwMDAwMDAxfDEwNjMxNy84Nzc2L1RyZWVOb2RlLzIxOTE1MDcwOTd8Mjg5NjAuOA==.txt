VSOP Title: Preparation of IGF-1-LR3 and EGF growth factor stock solutions

## IGF-1-LR3

Note: Please perform this procedure with the BSC light turned off. Growth
factors are often sensitive to light exposure.

  1. Calculate the required volume of Ultra-pure MilliQ (Type 1) water required to create a 0.05 mg/mL stock solution of IGF-1-LR3.
    1. For example a powder stock of 1 mg would required 20 mL of Ultra-pure MilliQ water to create a 0.05 mg/mL stock solution.
  2. Sterile filter the required volume using the appropriate consumable (i.e. 50 mL syringe for 40 mL of MilliQ) [See 7.1] in a BSC.
  3. Retrieve the stock powder from storage location (IGF-1-LR3 powder is kept at -20째C) and transfer into a BSC.
  4. Using a serological pipette transfer a small volume of filtered MilliQ into the stock powder vessel and pipette mix throughly to dissolve the stock powder.
  5. Repeat the previous step for any additional stock powder vessels.
  6. Transfer the dissolved GF solution from each vessel into the main vessel containing the sterile MilliQ (see step 2).
  7. Check each stock powder vessel to ensure no powder is left. If any powder remains, repeat step 4 until the vessel is clean.
  8. Using a serological pipette, carefully mix the solution to ensure a homogenous mix or swirl gently in a clockwise manner if the volume exceeds 300 mL.
  9. Transfer the sterile solution into smaller vessels depending on the users requirement.
    1. For smaller volumes use sterile 1.5 mL micro-centrifuge tubes and sterile 15/50 mL falcon tubes for larger volumes.
  10. Place the aliquots into an appropriately sized container, e.g. 500 mL sterile pot for the 1.5 mL centrifuge tubes, or a tube rack for the 15/50 mL falcon tubes.
  11. Store in a -20째C freezer until required.

## EGF

Note: Please perform this procedure with the BSC light turned off. Growth
factors are often sensitive to light exposure.

  1. Calculate the required volume of Ultra-pure MilliQ (Type 1) water required to create a 0.05 mg/mL stock solution of EGF.
    1. For example a powder stock of 1 mg would required 20 mL of Ultra-pure MilliQ water to create a 0.05 mg/mL stock solution.
  2. Sterile filter the required volume using the appropriate consumable (i.e. 50 mL syringe for 40 mL of MilliQ) [See 7.1] in a BSC.
  3. Retrieve the stock powder from storage location (EGF powder is kept at -20째C) and transfer into a BSC.
  4. Using a serological pipette transfer a small volume of filtered MilliQ into the stock powder vessel and pipette mix throughly to dissolve the stock powder.
  5. Repeat the previous step for any additional stock powder vessels.
  6. Transfer the dissolved GF solution from each vessel into the main vessel containing the sterile MilliQ (see step 2).
  7. Check each stock powder vessel to ensure no powder is left. If any powder remains, repeat step 4 until the vessel is clean.
  8. Using a serological pipette, carefully mix the solution to ensure a homogenous mix or swirl gently in a clockwise manner if the volume exceeds 300 mL.
  9. Transfer the sterile solution into smaller vessels depending on the users requirement.
    1. For smaller volumes use sterile 1.5 mL micro-centrifuge tubes and sterile 15/50 mL falcon tubes for larger volumes).
  10. Place the aliquots into an appropriately sized container, e.g. 500 mL sterile pot for the 1.5 mL centrifuge tubes, or a tube rack for the 15/50 mL falcon tubes.
  11. Store in a -20째C freezer until required.
