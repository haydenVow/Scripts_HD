Process:

1\. Aliquotted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then
placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath for a minimum of 20 minutes
prior to use:

  1. TrypLE:    200   mL in  1  250 mL bottle
  2. dPBS (for neutralising and washing)     400 mL in     1  500 mL bottle
  3. Growth media:     600  mL in    1  1 L bottle 
  4. Times that all aliquots were placed in the water bath to warm before use   14:07   

Note: if aliquots were placed in water bath at different times, record the
time stamp for each individual solution.




2\. Washed the flask(s) with dPBS.

3\. Added     200  mL tryple to each vessel/well and incubated at 37˚C for
15 min. 14:41-14:56  

Note: Fibroblasts typically require 15-18 minutes of incubation with tryple,
slightly longer than MuSCs.

4\. Neutralised with    200  dPBS (warmed) and combined cell suspension into a
tube.

5\. Centrifuged at 650 x g for 5 min

  1. Start/Finish time for centrifugation was   15:10 \- 15:15 , 15:17-15:23  




6\. Aspirated the supernatant(s)

7\. Resuspended pellet(s) in       2mL growthmedia for each tube and pooled
into 1 50mL tube. Media was topped up to a final volume of 30 mL  

8\. Transfer 10 uL of cell suspension to a 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube and
performed a cell count using the haemocytometer and recorded the cell count
data in widget or the Google Doc spreadsheet called 'Cell Count Spreadsheet'
(see link below):

9\. Total cell number was:     73,320,000  

10\. Seeded 8990 cells per cm2 of the CF (higher density because high cell
numbers needed in 3 days). Note that fibroblasts prefer to be subcultured
closely together.

11\. Volume of cell suspension required for subculture was:    9.3mL  

12\. Transfer   9.3mL  of cell suspension to the pre-warmed 2x 600 mL Growth
Media.

13\. Transfer cell suspension into 2x 4CF

14\. Transfer flask/plate(s) to incubate at  14:47  

  * [X]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
