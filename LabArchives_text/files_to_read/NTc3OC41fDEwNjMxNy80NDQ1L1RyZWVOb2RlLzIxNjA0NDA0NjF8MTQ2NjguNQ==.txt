Process:

1\. Aliquotted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then
placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath for a minimum of 20 minutes
prior to use:

  1. TrypLE:    200  mL in  1  250mL bottle
  2. dPBS (for neutralising and washing)     200 mL in     2   250mL bottles
  3. Growth media:     600  mL in    1  1 L bottle
  4. Times that all aliquots were placed in the water bath (30ºC) to warm before use    :  a/pm 

Note: if aliquots were placed in water bath at different times, record the
time stamp for each individual solution.




2\. Washed the flask(s) with dPBS.

3\. Added     200 mL tryple to CF and incubated at 30˚C for    15   min. Time:
18:02 - 18:17  

Note: Fibroblasts typically require 15-18 minutes of incubation with tryple,
slightly longer than MuSCs.

4\. Neutralised with    200  dPBS (warmed) and combined cell suspension into
8x   50mL  tubes. Double-check ideal way to do this with a 4CF

5\. Centrifuged at 650 x g for 5 min

  1. Start/Finish time for centrifugation was    :    \-    :  a/pm 




6\. Aspirated the supernatant(s)

7\. Resuspended pellet(s) in       30 mL growthmedia.  

8\. Transfer 50 uL of cell suspension to a 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube and
performed a cell count using the haemocytometer and recorded the cell count
data in widget or the Google Doc spreadsheet called 'Cell Count Spreadsheet'
(see link below):

SSIBtIylyrBQE5kRX5Z8NtI/edit#gid=0

  




9\. Total cell number was:     109,920,000  

10\. Seeded ~7.5k cells per cm2 of the flasks/plates.

11\. Volume of cell suspension required for subculture was:     6.2mL  

12\. Transfer   6.2mL of cell suspension to the pre-warmed  600 mL Growth
Media.

13\. Transfer cell suspension into new 4CF

14\. Transfer flask/plate(s) to incubate at   19:20  :

  * [X]  30ºC, 5% CO2
