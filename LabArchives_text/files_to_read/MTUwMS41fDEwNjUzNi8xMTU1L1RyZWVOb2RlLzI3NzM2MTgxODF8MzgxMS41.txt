Batch 34 Overview

Fibroblasts - CHOMP09

Batch Total Weight: 261.5g

Batch Objectives/Outline:

  * Produce as much mass as possible for investor tastings
  * Identify whether frequent feeding or more frequent handling effect the rate of peeling in 10CS

  
Experiment Plan:

Note - The changed feeding schedule only applied for week 2.

  * Week 1 establishes the culture and sets up the treatment schedule so is the same across all conditions
  * Week 3 is the final stage of the batch where increased feeds are performed to encourage peeling and growth.
  * This experiment aims to see if removing one feed in Week 2 or replacing it with a shake has a noticeable impact of peeling time. 

  

Actual Experiment Timeline:

Notable Events:

  * Flasks did not peel within the expected time frame
    * For this reason the harvest date was extended from the 01/04 to the 04/04
    * An extra shaking step was also performed for ALL groups on the 31st of March in an attempt to speed up seeding
  * Even with the extra time and shaking, all flasks still required TrypLE to harvest all layer. It is not clear why this was the case.

Batch/Experiment Results:

Observations on groups:  

  * No significant differences in peeling rates were observed between the groups, as every 10CS required TrypLE to be harvested. 
  * Some subtle differences in peeling were noticed between the groups:
    * In both groups 1 and 2 a few layers were peeled (3-4) or half peeled at the time of harvest. 
    * Only some corner peeling was observed in group 3 (this group showed least signs of being ready for non-TrypLE harvest).
  * Interesting observation that may or may not have had an effect is one incubator was accidentally left at 37'C for a few hours once flasks were transferred from Production Lab into Library Lab and the next day 2x10CS in Group 1 had a single layer peeled from that incubator (observed on Friday 1/04/22). The other 2 flasks (one from group 1 and another from group 2) had no layers peeled.  
  

Conclusion:

  * Whilst there were no significant difference between the groups, there was slightly more advanced peeling in groups 1 and 2 suggesting that an increase in feeding or mechanical handling of the flasks may induce slightly more peeling than leaving the flasks, unfed and untouched for longer periods of time.  
Therefore if peeling is delayed, adding in more feeds or shakes could help
speed this up, whereas reducing the feeds or handling could delay peeling.  
  

  




Contamination Issues:

  * 28/03/22 - 1x 10CS [ID:11215, group 3] was found contaminated with mould - incubated in the big Thermo. The lids were immediately parafilmed before moving and then disposed directly into a biohazard bag and brought outside. All other cultures in the the big Thermo were wiped with F10 and ethanol.
  * 04/04/22 \-  Contamination found in flask 1x10CS ID: 11237 (group 2) - bacterial - immediately disposed into clinical waste bag. 
  * 04/04/22 \- Batch 34 harvested (all using TrypLE). Flasks were split between library lab (8x10CS flasks) and main lab (15x10CS). Library lab flasks were observed for variation is peeling and then harvested all together in 1 tube (95g). Main lab flasks (all in 4 stack thermo incubators) were harvest into 3 different tubes depending on experimental group. Some aggregates in group 1 main lab harvest tube was put into group 2 and group 3 main lab harvest tubes to even the weight distribution of the tubes. 
  * 04/04/22 \- During clean up of Batch 34 harvest flasks, Varshana discovered black mould spots in the underside of one of the main lab flasks

  

  * 1g Samples from each harvest tube was extracted by LP on 06/04/22. Matthew co-ordinated delivery of samples to Belinda at Quantal on 07/04/22 for QC by enrichment
  * Belinda contacted LP with results showing all samples contaminated with fungi 13/04/22. ID requested for the 2 species grown.
