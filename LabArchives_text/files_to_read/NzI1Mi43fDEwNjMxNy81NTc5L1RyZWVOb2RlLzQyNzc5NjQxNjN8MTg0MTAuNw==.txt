Results

BIOPSY  
A total of 4 biopsies were collected. 2 biopsies were collected from the
vastus lateralis and 2 from the biceps femoris. Each biopsy was processed
following Vows standard protocol for the isolation of primary cells from
mammalian muscle tissue. 3/4 of the isolate extracted from each biopsy was
frozen as crude homogenate, while the remaining 1/4 was placed into immediate
culture.  
  
ESTABLISHMENT OF ADHERENT CULTURES  
After 6-7 days in culture, adherent cell populations were first observed in
all 4 WALLE cultures - WALLE06,  WALLE07, WALLE08 and WALLE09.

PASSAGES  
WALLE06 underwent 5 passages.  
WALLE07 and WALLE09 underwent 4 passages.  
WALLE08 cell numbers never approached confluence and therefore never underwent
a passage.  
  
TERMINATION OF CULTURES  
WALLE08 was terminated after 14 days in culture as the adherent cells failed
to proliferate beyond a population of a few cells.  
WALLE07 was terminated after 50 days in culture due to senescent morphology
and ongoing stunted proliferation.  
WALLE06 and WALLE09 were terminated after 53 days in culture due senescent
morphology and ongoing stunted proliferation.

Effect of seeding density and media formulations on p5 WALLE06 cells  
Due to severely stunted cell growth, a last ditch attempt was made to kick-
start cell growth, using WALLE06 cells, which had already been in culture for
48 days. Cells were passaged and seeded across the following conditions.

1\. DMEM/F12 +15% FBS +1x P/S (50% conditioned), seeded at either 7500/cm or
15000/cm  
2\. DMEM/F12 +15% FBS +1x P/S (100% fresh) seeded at either 7500/cm or
15000/cm  
3. DMEM/F12 +20% FBS +1x P/S (100% fresh) seeded at 7500/cm only.   
  
JUSTIFICATION  
  
Trialling higher seeding density of 1500 cells/cm: Cell contact between
fibroblasts can promote proliferation.  
Seeding in 50% conditioned media: Utilising conditioned media allows us to
retain cell generated growth factors and cytokines within the media, which may
promote proliferation.  
Trialling 20% FBS growth media: Optimal concentrations of FBS in growth media
can vary between species, we have seen for example, that CHOMP07 and CHOMP09
cell have a far greater rate of proliferation in 20% compared to 10% FBS
media. See lab book here: https://au-
mynotebook.labarchives.com/share/Vow%2520-%2520Team%2520Science/NjY2NS4xfDEwNjMxNy81MTI3LTQyMjE0L1RyZWVOb2RlLzM0NzIyMjQ1ODZ8MTY5MTkuMQ==

It is possible that WALLE would also demonstrate greater proliferative
capacity in more serum rich media.  
  
Results  
Cultures were observed 5 days after seeding. None of the seeding or media
variations had successfully kick-started cellular proliferation, with any
increase in confluence being marginal across all cultures. Due to time
constraints, cell counts we not performed, so quantitative data is not
available.
