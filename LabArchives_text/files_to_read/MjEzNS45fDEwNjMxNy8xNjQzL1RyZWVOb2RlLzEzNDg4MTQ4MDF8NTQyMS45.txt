Process:

1\. Aliquotted  1 mL  mL of  E6 into  1 x 15 mL    tube. Placed in water bath
13:22

2\. Removed  100 % of supernatant from 96-well plate.

3\. Replaced with  140  uL per well for planar culture wells and  230  uL per
scaffold

4\. Returned vessel to incubate at:

  * [x]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (aviary cells)

  

  * Incubator (#  ), Lab [Main/Library/Production]
