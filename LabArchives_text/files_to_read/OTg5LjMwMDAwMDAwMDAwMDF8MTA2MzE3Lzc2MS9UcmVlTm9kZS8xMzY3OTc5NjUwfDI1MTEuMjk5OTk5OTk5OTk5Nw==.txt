Process:

1\. Aliquotted   30 mL  mL of  growth Media into  1     tube(s). Placed in
water bath   11:30 am

2\. Stopped the shaker and removed cultures from the incubator before
restarting the shaker   12:30pm

3\. Placed suspension flask(s) inside the BSC and allowed to sit static for
3-5 minutes to allow microcarriers to settle to the base of the flask.

2\. Carefully removed  50  % of supernatant from the flask(s) by pipetting
slowly and following the meniscus with the pipette tip so as to avoid placing
the pipette tip near the microcarriers at the base of the flask(s).

3\. Replaced with  30 mL (per well/per vessel) of  growth   media.

4\. Returned vessel to incubate at:   12:40pm , incubator #  80  

  * [ x ]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (aviary cells)

  

  

***Note that this E250 was unlabeled, but there is only 1 on the shaker in the
main lab incubator, so that one was fed!
