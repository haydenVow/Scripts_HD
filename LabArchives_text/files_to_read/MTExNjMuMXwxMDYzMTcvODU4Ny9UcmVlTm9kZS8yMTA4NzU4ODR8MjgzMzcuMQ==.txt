Aim/Purpose


Background

In order to perform tissue-engineering experiments using suspension adapted
cells, which were once an adherent line, we need to be able to understand how
suspension cells can "re-adapt" to an adherent environment. It's been shown
that the Nuvonis suspension line can adhere to tissue culture plastic under
serum containing and serum free conditions. This type of "re-adaptation" or
"phenotypic switching" of cells to adhere to a substrate will likely require
broad transcriptional changes allowing cells to bind plastic, matrix or other
biomaterial-based substrates.

Aim

To perform transcriptomic analysis on suspension cells and adherent re-adapted
cells, in order to understand how this phenotypic switch occurs.

Hypothesis

Suspension adapted cells will increase levels of genes associated with
adhesion (focal adhesion, cytoskeletal, integrins etc.)


Methods and Experiment Layout


Brief Method

This experiment will compare multiple conditions and timepoints of suspension
cells + adherent re-adapted cells. Conditions are as follows:

  * Suspension - 3x E125 flasks seeded with 250k/mL in 30mL of 50:50 RPMI:Hycell GM cultured for 24 hours (conditions #1-3)
  * Suspension - 3x E125 flasks seeded with 250k/mL in 30mL of 50:50 RPMI:Hycell GM cultured for 4 days (conditions #4-6)
  * Adherent re-adapted - 3x T175 flasks seeded with 20k/cm2 in 20mL of 50:50 RPMI:Hycell GM cultured for 24 hours (conditions #7-9)
  * Adherent re-adapted - 3x T175 flasks seeded with 20k/cm2 in 20mL of 50:50 RPMI:Hycell GM cultured for 4 days (conditions #10-12)
  * Adherent re-adapted - 3x T175 flasks seeded with 20k/cm2 in 20mL of DMEM/F12 + ITS + 18.8mg/ml BSA + P/S cultured for 24 hours (conditions #13-15)
  * Adherent re-adapted - 3x T175 flasks seeded with 20k/cm2 in 20mL of DMEM/F12 + ITS + 18.8mg/ml BSA + P/S cultured for 4 days (conditions #16-18)
  * Adherent re-adapted - 3x T175 flasks seeded with 20k/cm2 in 20mL of DMEM/F12 + FBS + P/S cultured for 24 hours (conditions #19-21)
  * Adherent re-adapted - 3x T175 flasks seeded with 20k/cm2 in 20mL of DMEM/F12 + FBS + P/S cultured for 4 days (conditions #22-24)
