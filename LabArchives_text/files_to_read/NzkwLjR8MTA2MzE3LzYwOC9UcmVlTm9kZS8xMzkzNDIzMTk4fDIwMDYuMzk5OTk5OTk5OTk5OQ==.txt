Process:

1\. Aliquotted   20 mL  mL of  E6 Media into  50 mL     tube(s). Placed in
water bath   12:18 a/pm (Aliquot was found with 40mL of media, not 20mL)

24-well plate:

2\. Removed  100  % of supernatant from vessel.

2/. Removed the plate from the incubator (see slack exchange linked below).

3\. Aliuqoted 1.5mL of E6 prewarmed media into 12 wells on a new 24 well plate
in the same locations as the culture.

4\. Transferred the plate insert from the culture to the new wells on the 24
well plate containing fresh E6. Used the old lid on the new plate.

5\. Moved the plate back to the incubator [13:43] Top binder incubator #77.

  * [X]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (aviary cells)

6\. Discarded the old plate.

7\. Returned the remaining E6 media in the 50mL tube to the fridge.

Couldn't locate the 24 well plate in the Thermo incubator, consulted with the
maturation team to locate the plate that needed feeding.  
  




The plate was located in the top binder incubator (incubator 77). Marked with
the culture ID 6536. This culture ID in airtable links to a 6 well plate. The
plate ID's in the binder incubator do not match correctly to those in
airtable.
