Process:

1\. 1. Added   64 mL/well of  E6 Media to 64 wells of  2 x 48-well plates  and
250 mL/well of  E6 Media to 16 wells of 1x 96 well plate. Placed in incubator
for at least 20 minutes  14:36  

2\. Retrieved culture plates and warmed media plates from incubator.

3\. Using a well ethanol-sprayed hand, lifted well inserts by the edge and
moved into fresh media plate. Repeated with second plate.

4\. Returned vessel to incubate at:

  * [x]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (aviary cells)

  

  * Incubator (thermo), Lab [Main]
