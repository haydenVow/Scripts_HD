Equipment & Reagents
  
  
  1. 3 x empty non-treated 96-wps (output plates)
  2. 3 x DSD culture plates (input plates)
  3. 1 x 12-well OT2 reservoir 
  4. 1 x 200 uL OT2 pipette tip box
  5. Hoechst solution (50 ug/mL in MilliQ)
  6. Sytox green/Nuc green solution (1 drop/mL in dPBS)


Process

  1. Prepared 7 mL of Hoechst solution (50 ug/mL / 1:20 dilution of 1 mg/mL stock in MilliQ). Stored in light-safe tube until ready to use. 
  2. Prepared 25 mL of Sytox/Nuc Green solution (1 drop stock per 1 mL dPBS). Store in light-safe tube until ready to use.
  3. Started up "Fox" OT2 (Library Lab) and loaded protocol (attached below) 
  4. Set up deck as specified in protocol
    1. Note: tips to not have to be sterile for this protocol as the cells are endpoint
  5. Added Hoechst and Sytox to 12-well reservoir ("Media Vessel #1") as specified below:
    1.         A1 of Media Vessel #1 on 1 : Media 1 - Hoechst : 6000.00 uL
        A2 of Media Vessel #1 on 1 : Media 1 - Sytox : 12000.00 uL
        A3 of Media Vessel #1 on 1 : Media 1 - Sytox : 12000.00 uL

  6. Ran labwear offset calibration on OT2 
  7. Started protocol 
    1. Start time: 
    2. Run time: 
  8. Once protocol was complete, removed plates and centrifuged for 1 min at 300 x g. 
  9. Imaged plates in order that they were stained (1, 2, 3 then 4) on main lab Zaber microscope (DAPI & AF488)
    1. Notes: 
      1. Please scan each plate ID before imaging and also include plate number when naming the folder and in the notes section to ensure we don't get the plate numbering wrong
      2. Keep plates in light-safe box while waiting to be imaged 
  10. Shut down and cleaned OT2.
