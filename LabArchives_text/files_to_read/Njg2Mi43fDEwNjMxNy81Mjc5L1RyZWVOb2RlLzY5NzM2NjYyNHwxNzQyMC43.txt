Results/ Summary

Homogenate/ Isolate  
5x biopsies were collected, processed into crude homogenate and cryopreserved.
A total of 20 vials of homogenate were banked.

Cryopreservation of tissue for proteomics/genomics and histology  
1x biopsy was frozen in OCT as appropriate for future histological analysis.
Unfortunately there was uncertainly around the protocol for the
cryopreservation of tissue for proteomics/genomics, and tissue has therefore
not preserved for this purpose.

Dermal outgrowth culture  
After 12 days in outgrowth culture, we did not see the emergence of a plastic
adherent cell population, and the culture was terminated.
