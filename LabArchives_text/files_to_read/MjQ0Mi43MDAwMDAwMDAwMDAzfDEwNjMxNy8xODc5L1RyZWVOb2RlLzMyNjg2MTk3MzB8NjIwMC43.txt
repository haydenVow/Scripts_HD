1\. Prepared    mL  PBST (0.2% Triton-X)

2\. Prepared    mL  blocking buffer: PBST (0.1% Triton-X + PBS) + 3% bovine
serum albumin (BSA). (Kept in the fridge until needed in blocking step)

3\. Prepared Primary MF20 + MyoD Antibody Mix: :   µL   Primary #1 MyoG (Santa
Cruz)   (1:200  ) +   µL   Primary #2 MF20 (DSHB)   (1:50  ) +  5  mL Blocking
Buffer

4\. Prepared Primary MyoD Antibody Mix:    µL   Primary #1 MyoG (Santa Cruz)
(1:200  ) +   2.5  mL Blocking Buffer

5\. Prepared Primary MF20 Antibody Mix:    µL   Primary #2 MF20 (DSHB)   (1:50
) +  2.5  mL Blocking Buffer



Pipette-mixed antibody mix and stored refrigerated away from light until
needed.

Process:

Permeabilise

1\. Removed PBS from each well.

2\. Added   µL PBST (0.2% Triton-X) to each well for 15 min:  : - : pm

3\. Aspirated PBST for each well.




Blocking

1\. Added  100 µL of blocking buffer (3% BSA in PBST [0.1% Triton-X]) and
incubate for 45 minutes - 1hr at RT. (no more than 1 hour):   : - : a/pm




Single/Simultaneous Primary Antibody staining

1\. Removed blocking buffer from each well.

2\. Add the correct mix of antibody to each well - Make sure that the controls
do not receive any primary antibody.  

3\. Incubated cells with primary antibody for 90min - 2hrs at RT, or 4ºC
overnight:   : - : a/pm

4\. Parafilmed plates and stored at 4ºC in tissue culture lab Fridge.

After this step, all further task should be performed in a dark room. The
vessel should also be wrapped foil when not used.
