Cell Suspensions

1\. Make up a 15M / 100 uL cell suspension (150M / mL)

2\. Make up a 5M / 5 mL cell suspension (1M / mL)

Note: 2 x 10M vials required.




Method

For drop-wise encapsulation: cut the tip of P200 tip (at first graduation line
from the tip) and drew up 150uL. 50uL dead volume in pipette tip following
dispense so total dispensed = 100uL. Deposited directly into syringe with
needle attached.

To prepare working stock thrombin: 1.5uL of 8U/uL stock into 100uL sterile
filtered MilliQ water to give 120U/mL working solution. This was used for
above experiment.

Vials thawed: 3638 and 3639 10M each, added 1mL to each vial and added both to
single 15mL falcon tube at 12:30

Spin: 12:38 - 12:42

Resuspended cells in 3mL growth media total, took sample for count 1:5
dilution with trypan blue

  * placed in incubator 15:50
  * parafillm condition removed from incubator at 16:45
  * added CaCl to parafillm condition at 16:50
  * moved parafilm suspension to wells at 17:10
