# Observations on all remaining flask sets as at 29 AUG 2021

Set 1: (CTRL - no treatment)

No signs of peeling/aggregation, flasks to continue in culture until they
either peel or the last of the other sets is due to be harvested (whichever
comes first).

Set 2: (pre-confluence treated with VitC and TGFb)  

Signs of peeling/aggregation in 5/7 flasks but it is incomplete (see
photograph image below), flasks to continue in culture until they show signs
of more complete peeling/aggregation. It is expected that over time the
peeling will continue until the cell membrane comes off entirely or is reduced
to a ring-like structure on the surface of the flasks. All flasks in this set
will be harvested when at least one flask take on this appearance.

Set 3: (Treated with VitC and TGFb at 100% confluence)

No signs of peeling/aggregation, flasks to continue in culture.

Set 4: (Treated with VitC and TGFb post-100% confluence - this has not
happened yet)

No signs of peeling/aggregation, flasks to continue in culture.

Set 5: (Seeded with VitC)

N/A - flasks have already been harvested due to swift peeling/aggregation of
the cells

Set 6: (Seeded in the presence of TGFb and to be treated with VitC/TGFb at
100% confluence - this has not happened yet)

[NOTE: Seeded much later than the other sets above using cells from Batch-016]

No signs of peeling/aggregation, flasks to continue in culture.
