### Process:

1\. Took image of vessel with microscope on phase setting.

2\. Aliquotted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then
placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath for a minimum of 20 minutes
prior to use:

  1. TrypLE:   600  mL 
  2.  dPBS (for neutralising):   600  mL
  3.  dPBS (for washing):   600  mL
  4. Growth medium (for pellet resuspension):   30  mL
    * GM = D/F+20%FBS+1xP/S 
  5. Growth media conditions (for seeding):   7 x 60 mL aliquots (1 x 60 mL aliquot/condition)  

Time that all aliquots were placed in the water bath the warm before use
10:40  

Note: if aliquots were placed in water bath at different time, record the time
stamp for each individual solution.




4\. Removed vessel(s) from the incubator

5\. Collected supernatant in sterile 2L bottle.

5\. Washed the vessel(s) with dPBS (warmed). Collected dPBS in sterile 500 mL
bottle.  

6\. Added  200  mL TrypLE to each 4CF and incubated at 30˚C.

  1. Start/Finish for TrypLE was   10:54 - 11:08     

7\. While flasks were tryplising, split 2.4L of collected supernatant + dPBS
into 10 x 250 mL tubes and centrifuged at 800 xg for 5 min 11:28 - 11:33,
11:34 - 11:39, 11:41 - 11:46, 11:47 - 11:52  

  1. Poured off supernatant, leaving ~20 mL on pellet. Resuspended and moved into 6 x 50 mL tubes.   

  2. Centrifuged at 800 x g for 5 min 11:57 - 12:02  

  3. Aspirated supernatant off pellet and resuspended in 25 mL dPBS  

  4. Centrifuged at 800 x g for 5 min 12:07 - 12:12  

  5. Aspirated supernatant off pellet and resuspended in 20 mL Tryple. Incubated for 15 min (observe for cells sheets to have broken up more). 12:18 - 12:33  

  6. Strained cell suspension using a 40 um cell strainer to remove large clumps that hadn't broken up in Tryple. Added 20 mL dPBS to neutralise.   

  7. Centrifuged at 800 x g for 5 min 12:44-12:49
  8. Aspirated supernatant off pellet and resuspended in growth medium. Combined with cell suspension from 4CFs.   

7\. Neutralised flasks with   200 mL   dPBS/flask and combined cell suspension
into   6 x 250 mL  tubes.

8\. Centrifuged neutralised cells at 650 x g for 5 min.

  1. Start/Finish time for centrifugation was
    1.  11:12 - 11:17 (cells did not pellet properly,so increased G to 800 and re-spun) 11:19 - 11:24    

    2.   11:28 - 11:33      




9\. Aspirated the supernatant(s).

10\. Strain cell suspension through a 40 um cell strainer to remove
clumps/aggregates before final reuspsension  

11\. Resuspended pellet(s) in    20   mL   growth   media

12\. Aliquoted   2 x 100 uL  of resuspended cells into a microcentrifuge tube
for cell count. Diluted to 1:25 in trypan blue.  

13\. Performed a cell count using the haemocytometer and recorded the cell
count data in the Google Doc spreadsheet: Cell Count Spreadsheet

  1. Total cell number was:     (107,300,000 + 116,550,000)/2 =  111,925,000    

  2. Volume of cell suspension required for subculture was:     4.6 mL per 60 mL aliquot, 1.54 mL per E-125     

  3. Cell density per vessel:   4,663,541 cells/flask = 233,177 cells/mL    




14\. Transferred   4.6 mL of cell suspension to each pre-warmed  60  mL Growth
media aliquot  

15\. Transferred 21.5 mL of each aliquot into E-125 flasks (3 reps of 7
conditions = 21 total E-125 flasks)

16\. Took 1 x 100 uL aliquot from each E-125 flask and transferred to 2 x
96-well plate for staining & cell count (see "staining" rich text entry below)

17\. Transferred E-125s to shaking platform (120 RPM) to incubate at:  

  * []  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (avian cells)
  * [x]  30ºC, 5% CO2 (reptilian cells)




Staining

Prepared dead stain solution in amber/black centrifuge tube:  
\- 4 mL dPBS  
\- 4 drops Nucgreen AF488 dead stain  
\- Vortex for 5 seconds to mix

Prepared Hoechst stain (50 ug/mL) solution in amber/black centrifuge tube:  
\- 9500 uL MilliQ  
\- 500 uL Hoechst Trihydrochloride trihydrate (1mg/mL)  
\- Vortex for 5 seconds to mix. Solution can be stored at 4°C for up to 6
months

  1. Added 20 uL of Hoechst stain directly to cells
  2. Added 80 uL of dead stain solution (dPBS+Nucgreen) to cells
  3. Incubated for 30 minutes in the dark at room temperature 14:36 - 15:06
  4. Made 4x, 8x and 16x dilutions of the sample in dPBS 
  5. Centrifuged plates at 300 RCF for 1 minute 15:13 - 15:14  
  

  6. Prepared plate map:
