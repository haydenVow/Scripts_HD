Procedure - 100% Treatment with VitC

  1. Turn on the water bath and set to 37'C.
  2. Aliquot required growth media into a sterile container/s and add Vitamin C (aka LAA2P) [stock concentration 100mg/mL] to a working concentration of 50ug/mL in growth media i.e. 500uL per 1L of media.
  3. Place in the water bath and heat for at least 20 minutes. 
  4. Transfer flasks to the BSC, wiping with 70% EtOH. Discard media from the flask. 
  5. Replace selected flasks (Sets 4 and 5) with Treated media. Return to incubate and note the Flask ID. 

  

  




All flasks were imaged and observed for confluence.

For set 1, 3, & 4: Some areas at the bottom half of flasks were between
80-100% confluence, but much less so at the top of the flasks. Overall flask
confluence estimated to be 70-80% confluence.

For set 2:  
Flasks were mostly at 90-100% confluence at the bottom half of the flasks, but
less so at the top of the flasks. Overall flask confluence estimated to be
80-90% confluence.

For set 5:  
Flasks 7811, 7813, & 7814 have started to peel. All other flasks of this set
have not yet begun to peel, but were at 95-100% confluence. It was decided to
conducted the 50% feed on these flasks (with Vit C) and observe for more
peeling before harvesting.

  

Since 100% confluence was not yet reached for set 1, 3 & 4, Vit C treatment
was not conducted, and 50% feds conducted for set 2 and 5 only.


Sets 2 & 5: 50% Feed + VitC (50ug/mL)
