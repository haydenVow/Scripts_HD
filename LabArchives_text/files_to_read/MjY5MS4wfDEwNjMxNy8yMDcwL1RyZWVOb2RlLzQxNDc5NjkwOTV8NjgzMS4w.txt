Background:

A cell expansion cell harvest yielded more cells than was required. Instead of
disposing of the excess cells the cells were used to test seed out 3 new
scaffold variants which had been previously prepared and sterilised:  
  
1) Dry heat treated gelatin (gelatex) - see entry and entry

2) Dry heat treated zein (gelatex) - see entry and entry  
  
3) Autoclaved and Freeze-dried agarose (in-house) - see entry (sample tested
for Chris)  
  
Process:  
Media was removed from the samples and then the scaffolds were seeded at 3M
cells/scaffold in a 6-wp format (seeded higher than usual due to approximately
3x larger scaffold size from 96-wp size)

  

Details of the seeding can be found here:
