Process:

Aliquoted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then
placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath > 30 minutes prior to use

  1. Observed cultures under the microscope and recorded confluence in the table above. 
  2. Imaged cultures on 10x magnification (captured in Mia)
  3. TrypLE:   20  mL 
  4. dPBS (for washing & neutralising)   40 mL
  5. Growth media:    
  6. Washed the flask(s) with dPBS.
  7. Added    5ml (T75s or 10mL (T175s) tryple to each vessel/well and incubated at 37˚C for   xxxmin untill >90% cells detatched  
  8. Neutralized with   mL dPBS (warmed) and transferred cell suspension into    50  tubes.
  9. Centrifuged at 650 x g for 5 min.
  10. Aspirated+ discarded supernatant
  11. Resuspended pellet(s) in     respective growth medias media.  
Performed a cell count using the hemocytometer and recorded the cell count
data in widget or the Google Doc spreadsheet called 'Cell Count Spreadsheet'
(see link below):

  12. Total cell number was:  
 SILKIEK : 5,239,214  
 KINGO: 5,112,320

  13. Re-seeded cells as per table above.

  14. Transferred flasks to incubate at 37ºC, 5% CO2, library lab incubator #77
