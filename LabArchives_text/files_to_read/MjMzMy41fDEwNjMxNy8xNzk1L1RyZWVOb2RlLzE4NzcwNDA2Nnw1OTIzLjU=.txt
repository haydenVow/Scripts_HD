  1. A sample of each culture (100uL) was transferred to separate 1.5mL tubes
  2. Waited until the carriers had settled ot the bottom of the tube then aspirated and discared the supernatant in each tube, leaving the microcarrier pellet.
  3. Reuspended the carriers in each tube in 500uL of dPBS containing 1% w/v poloxamer 188 (mix 4945).
  4. Added 2.5uL of PI to each tube (stock ID 1129)
  5. Incubated carriers in the dark for 5 minutes.
  6. Aliquoted 3x100uL from each tube into individual wells on a 96 well plate.
  7. Took an image on the PHASE and AF555 channels (auto exposure) using the Axio microscope. (imaged one well for each culture).
  8. Transported the 96 well plate over to the library lab, printed a plate label for it (Culture ID 7083).
  9. Imaged the plate using the Zaber on both Phase and AF55 channels, imaging all wells for each original culture. 
    1. Row A: 6993
    2. Row B: 6992
    3. Row C: 6991
    4. Row D: 6990
    5. Row E: 6989
    6. Row F: 6988
  10. Settings used. 
    1. PHASE: 30ms exposure time, Intensity 1.4, 
    2. AF555: 400ms exposure time, intensity 25. 
    3. one image was captured at the centre of each well under both channels.
    4. Repeated the imaging process once more however the lamp intensity for the AF555 channel was increased to 75.
