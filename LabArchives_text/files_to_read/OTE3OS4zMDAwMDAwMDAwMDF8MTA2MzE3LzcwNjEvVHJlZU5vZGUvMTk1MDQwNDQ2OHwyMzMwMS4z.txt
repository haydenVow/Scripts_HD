### Process:

1\. Took image of vessel with microscope on phase setting.

2\. Gelatin coated     1 well (A2) of 1     x     6-well plate     vessel with
sterile filtered 0.1% gelatin solution and then incubated all coated flasks at
27˚C.

  1. Time when all vessels(s) placed into the incubator      15:03 pm 

3\. Aliquotted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then
placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath for a minimum of 20 minutes
prior to use:

  1. TrypLE:    4    mL in    1    tubes
  2.  dPBS (for neutralising):     2 x 2mL    mL
  3.  dPBS (for washing):     4    mL
  4. Growth media (for seeding):     6    mL 

Time that all aliquots were placed at RT to warm before use   15:39 pm

Note: if aliquots were placed in water bath at different time, record the time
stamp for each individual solution.




4\. Removed vessel(s) from the incubator     15:52  pm

5\. Washed the vessel(s) with dPBS (warmed).

6\. Added    2   mL tryple to each well and incubated at 27˚C.

  1. Start/Finish for TrypLE was   15:57 - 16:24 pm  (note* 'cell-looking objects' did not appear to detach after 25 mins, and were subsequently scraped with the tip of the pipette tip)  

7\. Neutralised with    2mL/well   dPBS and combined cell suspension into a
1 x 15mL tube per well (1 for well A1, 1 for well A2)    tube.

8\. Centrifuged at 650 x g for 5 min.

  1. Start/Finish time for centrifugation was    16:26  pm 




9\. Aspirated the supernatant(s).

10\. Resuspended each pellet in    3   mL   Growth   media    : a/pm

11. Transferred cell suspension (A1) into the non-coated      Well A1 of the 6-well plate  .

12. Transferred cell suspension (A2) into the pre-gelatin coated      Well A2 of the 6-well plate  .

13\. Transferred vessel(s) to incubate at:  16:39 pm  

  * [ ]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (avian cells)
  * [ X ] 26ºC, 5% CO2 (shark cells)

  




Observations/Summary:

Contents of wells A1 and A2 from culture

10851-GUMMY376-P0-1of2

were tryplised and seeded into a new 6-well plate in the same format.
