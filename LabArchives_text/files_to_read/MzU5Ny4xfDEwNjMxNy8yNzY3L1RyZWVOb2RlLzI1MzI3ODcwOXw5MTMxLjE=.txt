NOTE: Cells were spun at 300g instead of 650 in an effort to reduce the amount
of debris in the cultures.







7218-F-DOLLY12-Sheep P10-of : 1:100 Anti-clumping agent + RGD peptide  
7219-F-DOLLY12-Sheep P10-of : 1:100 Anti-clumping agent + YIGSR peptide  
7220-F-DOLLY12-Sheep P10-of : 1:100 Anti-clumping agent control  
7221-F-DOLLY12-Sheep P10-of : 1:100 Anti-clumping agent (low serum)




Process:  

1\. Place the pre-aliquotted  10 mL  mL of each respective type of Growth
Media into the water bath   10:15-10:35

2\. Placed shake tubes in centrifuge and centrifuge at 650 x g for 5 min at
RT.   10:25-10:30

3\. Aspirated supernatant from each pellet

4\. Added 1mL of respective growth media to each tube and used a P1000 pipette
to break up cell clumps.

6\. 15uL of each culture taken for viability check.

7\. Remaining 9mL of each respective media was added afterwards and triturated
with 10mL serological pipette to break up cell clumps for each culture further
and resuspend cells evenly.

8\. Returned 4 x vessel to incubate at:  10:45 Shaking at 206 RPM

Observations:

Centrifuging at 300g appears adequate to pellet the cells. There was also a
significant reduction in debris compared to previous counts, suggesting that
lower centrifugation speed allows for the removal of lighter weight debris.
