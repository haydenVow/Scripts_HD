NOTE: Please add 100ng/mL FGF + 100ng/mL IGF-LR3 to all cultures. - Needs to
be added fresh from frozen aliquots.  




## Feed performed by:  




Media/Reagents used:  
Media aliquots are located in library lab fridge 104. The FGF and IGF-LR3 need
to be added fresh. I have put aliquots in the top draw of the -20 freezer
labelled, SUNDAY SHAKER.

Process:

1\. Removed pre-prepared media from Library Lab fridge 104 (Top shelf)  10 mL
mL of each respective type of Growth Media

2\. Removed FGF and IGF-LR3 Sunday aliquots from top draw of the -20C freezer.

Added 100ng/mL of FGF-2 + IGF-LR3 to each media

  

3\. Placed shake tubes in centrifuge and centrifuge at 650 x g for 5 min at
RT.   time  

4\. Aspirated supernatant from each pellet

5\. Added 1mL of respective growth media to each tube and used a P1000 pipette
to break up cell clumps.

6\. Remaining 9mL of each respective media was added afterwards and triturated
with 10mL serological pipette to break up cell clumps for each culture further
and resuspend cells evenly.

7\. Returned 4 x vessel to incubate at:  time Shaking at 206 RPM

  * [X ]  37ÂºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * Incubator (#67 ), Lab [Library]
