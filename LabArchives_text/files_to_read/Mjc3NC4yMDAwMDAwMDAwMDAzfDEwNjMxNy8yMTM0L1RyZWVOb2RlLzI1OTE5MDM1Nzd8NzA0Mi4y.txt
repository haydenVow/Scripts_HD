Fridge #74 in a 1L bottle with "1" written on the lid. The ID is
A5621Fibroblast ECM scaffolds seeded with MuSC  
  
Cell FreeYou will need to aliquot 1 mL of E6 media into each of the wells as
according to the plate map above. Once filled move the plate into the
incubator to be pre-warmed. Once warmed transfer the tray and inserts from the
culture vessel into the new plate containing the fresh E6 media. Please
remember to use the old lid which contains all the IDs and scaffold conditions
as the lid for the new plate and please parafilm the plate in the BSC before
returning to the incubator.  
  
  




Process:

1\. Fill wells of new 48WP  with 1 mL of E6 media growth media (according to
plate map). Moved plate to incubator for at least 30 minutes. Timestamp: 08:35

2\. Retrieve the culture plate from incubator.

3\. Using sterile tweezers or hands (whichever is easier), move the trays
containing well inserts into the new 48WP containing fresh, warm media.

  1. Please use the old lid that contains the culture ID's as the lid for the new plate
  2. Please parafilm the plate containing the inserts and scaffolds in the BSC before returning to the incubator. 

4\. Returned new plate to incubate at: 09:15
