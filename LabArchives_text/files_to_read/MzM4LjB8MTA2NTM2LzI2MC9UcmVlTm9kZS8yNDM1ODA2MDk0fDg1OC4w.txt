Experimental Observations:

Bottle (A) - No Treatment:

  * No aggregation observed at any timepoint.
  * When harvested by scraping, the cells were very different to VitC treated bottle (B). Cells 'flaked' off the surface and broke up when scrapped off. 
  * Bottle also had to be washed with dPBS to ensure all cells were effectively removed from the bottle.  

  

Bottle (B) - VitC (50ug/mL) added at D7:

  * No aggregation observed at any timepoint.
  * When harvested by scraping, the cells were very different to control bottle (A). Cells came off easily in a thick sheet which stayed intact as it was scrapped off the surface of the flask.  



  

  

Bottle (C) - Seeded with VitC (50ug/mL):

  * Aggregated 8 days after VitC Treatment
  * Harvested on D9
    * Aggregate looked more rolled up onto itself and smaller on D9 compared to D8 

Aggregate on D8:
