  
  
We only require 12 pieces of scaffold, however we can not prepare enough
sample for only this much as the volume is too little for effective siring.
Therefore we will use the volumes below:

  

Determine the following key volumes and weights to make the desired number of
scaffold pieces:

  1. Number of scaffold pieces desired: 108 scaffolds (+ ~8 for C2C12 verification experiment)
  2. Volume of zein solution used per scaffold piece: 50 uL per piece, ~ 5 mL sol'n per 96WP 
  3. Total volume of zein solution (number of scaffold pieces x volume/piece) + loss/error: 5 + error = 10 mL total sol'n
  4. Total grams of zein required (total volume of zein solution / 5): 10/5 = 2 g zein powder
  5. Total volume of 80% ethanol to make (total volume of zein solution + loss/error to the filter): 10 + 2 = 12 mL 80% ethanol

  

  1. Acquire aliquot volumes of the Ultrapure water (sterile filter milliQ water using a 0.2 um filter into a sterile tube in the BSC) and of 100% ethanol 
  2. Weigh out 2 g of zein powder into a sterile sample pot and record the actual weight below:
    1. Actual zein weight:  2.003 g
  3. Transfer the zein powder, 100% ethanol and Ultrapure water into the BSC in the Production lab
  4. Make 15 mL of 80% ethanol in the BSC and filter it using a 0.2 um filter (12 mL ethanol + 3 mL water) 
    1. Volume made:  15 mL
  5. Add 12 mL of 80% ethanol into a sterile sample pot/container and add a sterile magnetic stirrer bar (previously spray with ethanol then autoclave in a autoclave bag) inside the BSC
  6. Commence mixing of the 80% ethanol on the stirrer (sprayed down and brought into the BSC) and slowly add the pre-weighed 2 g zein powder until it is all added
  7. Mix at room temperature until the powder has completely solubilised (20-60 minutes):
    1. Start time: 11:18
    2. Finish time: 12:09
  8. Add 200 uL of 0.2 um filtered ultrapure water to each well of 96-well plates (use multichannel pipette) 
    1. Number of wells required + error: 150 
    2. Total vol. filtered ultrapure water required =  30 mL + error = 35 mL 
  9. After solubilisation, carefully add 50 uL of the zein solution to the top surface of the ultrapure water in each well in the 96-well plate (drop by drop) so that a skin forms on the surface of the water (use multichannel) 
  10. Allow the zein to form in each plate inside the BSC with the lids completely removed for 60-90 minutes
    1. Start time (last plate): 12:15
    2. Finish time: (started removing first pieces) 13:20
  11. Using a sterile spatula and forceps, loosen the edges of each zein piece from the walls of the wells and transfer the zein pieces into a sterile sample pot/container/tissue culture dish with 20 mL of DMEM. Discard any damaged or cracked pieces
    1. Number of pieces discarded due to damage or dropping: 
    2. Number of pieces available for use: 
  12. Seal the container and store the scaffold pieces at 4C overnight or until needed, for a maximum of 7 days prior to use.
