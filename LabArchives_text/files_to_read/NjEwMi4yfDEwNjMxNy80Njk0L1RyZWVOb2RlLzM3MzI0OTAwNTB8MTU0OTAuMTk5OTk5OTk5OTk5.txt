Reagent preparation:

1\. Centrifuged the secondary antibody stock using the benchtop
microcentrifuge for 10 seconds.

2\. Prepared Secondary Antibody mix (pipette from the top/supernatant of
antibody solution):

  10 µL   Secondary #1   (1:1000  ) +  10 µL   Secondary #2   (1:1000  ) +  10
mL Blocking Buffer (PBST (0.1% Triton X + dPBS) + 3% BSA)  

If using AlexaFluor secondary antibodies then the max concentration should be
1:500 (typically used at 1:1000)

Pipette-mixed antibody mix and stored refrigerated away from light until
needed.

3\. Prepared DAPI mix:

  10 mL  PBS +   10 uL  of DAPI (1:1000)

Vortexed DAPI mix and stored refrigerated away from light until needed.

Process:

1\. Removed plate from fridge (incubated in primary antibodies overnight).

2\. Washed 3 times for 5 min with PBS at RT.

 11:43 - 11:57 a/pm

 11:57 - 12:06 a/pm

 12:07 - 12:21 a/pm

3\. Incubated the cells with secondary antibody mixture in the dark at RT for
1 hour.  : - : a/pm

Plate 1: 12:30

Plate 2: 12:36

Plate 3: 12:39

Plate 4: 12:42

NOTE: from this step onwards protect from the light by wrapping plates in foil
and perform experiment in the dark.




Counter staining

1\.  Removed 2nd antibody solution. 13:55 a/pm

2\.  Washed with DAPI (1:1000) in PBS for 5 min at RT in the dark.

14:08 - 14:13 a/pm

3\.  Washed in PBS 3 x 5 min at RT in the dark. (No Triton)
