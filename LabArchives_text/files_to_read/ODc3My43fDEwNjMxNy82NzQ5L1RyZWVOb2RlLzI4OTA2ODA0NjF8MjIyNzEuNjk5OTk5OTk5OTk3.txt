Aim/Purpose


To determine optimal small molecule inhibitor concentration for cell viability
during BUFFY myoblast differentiation


Technical Gap


The small molecules being tested in this experiment have not been previously
used, and thus preliminary data on the optimal working concentrations for cell
viability and myoblast differentiation must be gathered to inform the future
DSD experiment.

Figure 1. Plate map of media conditions. Small molecules will be added to E6
media in 5 different concentrations (C1-C5) with an additional treatment using
C3 including FBS to ensure cell viability. Media conditions will be run in
duplicate. E6 media + horse serum will be used as a control and will be run in
triplicate
