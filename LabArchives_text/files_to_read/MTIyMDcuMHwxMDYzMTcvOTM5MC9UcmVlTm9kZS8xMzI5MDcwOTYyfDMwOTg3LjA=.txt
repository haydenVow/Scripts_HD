Cumulus-oocyte complexes were cultured in North Carolina State University
(NCSU)-23 medium containing porcine follicular fluid, cysteine, hormonal
supplements and 0 to 50 μM BME for 20 to 22 h.

Blastocysts derived from oocytes matured with 25 μM BME had the highest
(P<0.05) trophectoderm (TE) and total cell numbers.

2-Mercaptoethanol (2-ME) has been used in ESC culture media since the first
derivation of mouse ESCs in 1981. Originally included as a reducing agent
because of concern about oxidation of culture components, it continues to be
used in hESC media.
