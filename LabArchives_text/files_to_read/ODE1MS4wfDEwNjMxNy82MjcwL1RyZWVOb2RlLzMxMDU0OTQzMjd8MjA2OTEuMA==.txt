Aim/Purpose


To generate a standard curve for XTT assay work and to determine whether this
assay is sensitive enough to detect cells at a density of <50 cells per well.


Hypothesis


We hypothesise that an XTT assay will provide reliable readings for wells
containing 50-200,000 cells, and that we will generate a calibration curve
that will be used for future XTT assay work.


Technical Gap


We have not used XTT assays to assess suspension cell metabolism and growth.
The assay reports accuracy between 50 and 20,000 cells per well (). We want to
see what the lowest cell density is where we can detect a meaningful colour
change to determine whether it would give relative readings at low confluence
at early SCC stages.


Method/Procedure


20-Jan-2022 Update: found out that plates need to be un-treated for use in the
plate reader, however we do not have untreated 384-wps. For future SCC work,
we also need to know if we can use ULA plates in the plate reader, as this is
also a type of coating. For now, proceeding with just 96-well plates
(untreated) and will test 384-well plates when I have more information.

Want to see if cells in suspension behave similarly with XTT assay  
  
Prepare XTT working solution and perform XTT assay on 4 x plates  
Stain takes ~3h to incubate, so need to do this earlier in the day
