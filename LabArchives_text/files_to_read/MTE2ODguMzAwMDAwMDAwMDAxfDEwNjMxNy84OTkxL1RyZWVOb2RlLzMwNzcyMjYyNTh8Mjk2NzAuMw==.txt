Took samples

  1. Unscrewed the "BENCHMARK" sample tube cover.
  2. Sprayed down the tube end with 70% ethanol.
  3. Connected a 5 mL sterile syringe.
  4. Withdrew slightly more than 3 mL (to purge the line).
  5. Discarded the 5 mL syringe.
  6. Connected a fresh sterile syringe and withdrew 3.5 - 4.0 mL of sample.
  7. Disconnected sample syringe and transferred 1 mL of sample each to 3 x 1.5 mL Eppendorf tubes for subsequent analysis:
    * Performed ViCell count
    * Performed manual cell count
    * Tested pH offline
    * Prepared sample for offline biochemistry analyses: "Biostat 22-July-2022" placed in red rack
      * 250uL taken from sample
      * diluted 1:2 with equal volume of dH2O (not PBS) 
      * Quick spin for 1 minute
      * Reserve supernatant in new 1.5mL tube and discarded pellet. Input sample info into datasheet here for later analysis offsite. Stored in sample box at -20degC
  8. Sprayed sample tube end and cap with 70% ethanol, re-attached cap.

  1. Turned off all bioreactor functions except for stirring and air.
  2. Reduced stirring to 120 RPM and air flow to 20 ccm.
  3. Took samples for testing, saved information here: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1YQIYn9VxPIqxVvu8pe9fudyDBRnuDsATzeaQwLhl0eg/edit#gid=1162240706&range=A1
    1. Samples for growth factors, species ID and genetic drift centrifuged at 1200 RCF for 5 minutes.

Nutritional Testing (Proximate, Amino Acid analysis, Fatty Acids, Vitamins,
Trace Elements)105 gspecimen jar-20C1\. Harvest cells and supernatant.  
2\. Centrifuge the samples to remove as much supernatant as you would during
production.  
3\. Place 105 g in container and in the -20 reg testing fridge.

Mycoplasma2x 2 mLeppendorf-80C1\. Media should not be changed for 3-4 days
prior to sampling.  
2\. Before harvest, remove 2x 2 mL of medium from the culture to be tested and
transfer to a sterile  
centrifuge tube. Centrifuge at 450 g for 5 minutes to remove cell debris.  
3\. Transfer 2x 1 mL medium from this tube to a second sterile tube. Eppendorf
tubes are  
suitable so long as the closure of the lid is considered safe for shipping.
Samples can  
be stored at 4 degrees celcius if shipped within 24-48 hours, but otherwise
should be stored at -80 degrees Celcius.  
  
  
  
Genetic Drift (Whole Genome Sequencing)2x 50 mL, snap freeze pelletfalcon

2\. Centrifuge the samples to remove as much supernatant as you would during
production.
