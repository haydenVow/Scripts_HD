Process:

 1\. Aliquotted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and
then placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath for a minimum of 20 minutes
prior to use:

  1.  TrypLE:  40 mL in 1 x 50 ml tubes
  2.  dPBS (for neutralising)  40 ml  in 1 x 50 ml tubes 
  3.  Growth media (for pellet resuspension):   10 mL in 1 x 15 ml tube
  4. Growth media: 120 ml for reseeding
  5.  Time that all aliquots were placed in the water bath to warm before use:    14:42 - 15:05 pm 

Note: if aliquots were placed in water bath at different times, record the
time stamp for each individual solution.




2\. Washed the flask(s) with dPBS.

3\. Added 10mL tryple to each vessel/well and incubated at 30ºC for 8 min

4\. Neutralised with 10 ml dPBS (warmed) and combined cell suspension into 4 x
50 ml tube.

5\. Centrifuged at 400 x g for 5 min  




6\. Aspirated the supernatant(s).

7\. Resuspend pellet(s) in 5mL growth media.

8\. Performed a cell count using the haemocytometer and recorded the cell
count data in the Google Doc spreadsheet called 'Cell Count Spreadsheet' (see
link below):

SSIBtIylyrBQE5kRX5Z8NtI/edit#gid=0

9\. Total cell number was:

ZIC1 + Igfbp4: 5,680,000 cells

ZIC1 + AQP1: 4,520,000

Control: 2,940,000 cells

AQP1 + Igfbp4: 3,040,000 cells

10\. Calculate the required volume cell suspension & freeze medium:

ZIC1 + Igfbp4: 1.999 ml (There will be 2 frozen vials containing about 2.27M
cells/ml)

ZIC1 + AQP1: 1.871 ml (There will be 2 frozen vials containing about 1.69
cells/ml)

Control: 3.065 ml (There will be 1 frozen vial containing 1,802,500 cells/ml)

AQP1 + Igfbp4: 3.129 ml (There will be 1 frozen vial containing 1,902,500
cells/ml)

11\. Calculate the required volume cell suspension for continuous cultures
(seeding density 6500 cells/cm^2; 1,137,500 cells in total):

ZIC1 + Igfbp4: 1.001 ml

ZIC1 + AQP1: 1.258 ml

Control: 1.935 ml

AQP1 + Igfbp4: 1.871 ml




12\. Took the amount of cell suspension for reseeding and put it into 30 ml of
pre-warmed growth media for each condition.

13\. Centrifuged remaining cell suspension at 400 x g for 5 min.  17:15  \-
17:20 pm

Whilst centrifuge is spinning, prepared & printed vial labels, labelled
cryovials. (Note that passage number will be the same as the culture you
harvest from. The passage number will increase by 1 during the revive of a
vial.)




14\. Aspirated supernatant carefully, taking care not to disturb the pellet.

15\. Resuspended the pellet in 1 mL freeze media (chilled, to reduce DMSO
toxicity).

16\. Aliquotted 1 mL into each cryovial (already labelled).

17\. Tightened the lids & transfer the cryovials to a Mr. Frosty immediately
into the -80ºC freezer.   17:45 pm

18\. Allow the cells to freeze for at least 18-24 hours before transferring to
Liquid Nitrogen storage.

  




Observations/Summary:

\- Instead of removing the supernatant of all conditions prior to adding the
cryostor into the 50 ml tube and then into the cryovial, I did one condition
at a time. This may have affected the viability of those cells that were in
cryostor (in Mr. Frosty) for too long.

\- I was a bit worried when I centrifuged my cells to then resuspend them in
cryostor that I couldn't see a cell pellet.
