Process
  
  
  1. Took 2 x 50 uL samples from culture 
  2. Performed count using haemocytometer 
    1. Cell count (average): 26,010,000
  3. Removed 0 mL of culture to leave 24M in flask
  4. Added 0 mL warmed medium to flask to top up to 30 mL 
  5. Replaced E125 in incubator at 37'C, 5% CO2, 120 RPM

*Note: I did not perform the feed given the average number of total cells was so close to 24M and we will be using them tomorrow for the HD media screening experiment.
