Note

Cells in the culture fed with CDM4 Avian media are much smaller than those in
the Nuvonis media. There appears to have been an increase in cell number in
the Nuvonis culture, but a drop in the Avian culture. In an attempt to kick-
start growth, I today added 1:100 Non-essential Amino Acid mix, and an
additional 2mM Glutamax.As per the last feed, FGF2 was added to both cultures
today, at a concentration of 0.1ug/mL.




Process:  

  1. Place media in water bath >15min prior to use
  2. Collected E125s from shaker, wiped with ethanol-sprayed Rediwipe, and brought into BSC 
  3. Using a 25 mL serological pipette, gently pipette-mixed culture for a few minutes to break up cell clumps
  4. Passed through a 70um cell filter
  5. Transfer suspension into 50 mL tubes.
  6. Centrifuged 50 mL tubes at 300 x g for 5 mins 
  7. Aspirated  75% (15 mL) of supernatant, taking extra care to not disrupt or aspirate pellet.
  8. Resuspended each pellet in the remaining 5mL of media, and took 2x 10ul samples from each culture for hemocytometer counts 
  9. Performed  hemocytometer counts (see below for counts).
  10. Topped up each 50 mL centrifuge tube with 15 mL of fresh pre-warmed media and resuspended cell pellet. 
  11. Pipette-mixed cultures, and transfer all cultures to E250 flask
  12. Returned E250 to incubator
