Growth Media:

[x] DMEM/F12 Boost

[x] RPMI Boost

For composition of each media refer to the media preparation lab book entry

  




Process:

  1. Prep growth media (5.5 mL) and place in water bath 
  2. Collected 8 x 50 mL shake tubes from shaker
  3. Centrifuged tubes at 300 x g for 5 min.    13:38 - 13:43     

  4. Aspirated   4.5 mL (500 uL remaining)  of supernatant leaving 0.5 mL in the tube, taking extra care to not disrupt or aspirate pellet
  5. Gently pipette-mixed cultures and took 20 uL samples from each culture and stored in separate microtubes until ready to count
  6. Loaded 10 x samples onto haemocytometers and observed cells and performed cell counts
  7. Discarded cultures where no live cells were found
  8. Fed cultures with live cells remaining.  
  
  
Cell counts:  
7929- 20,000  
7933- 28,000
