## Thaw and seed vial:

Aliquot the following and place in waterbath to warm: 6:20pm

  1. ~6mL commercial DMEM/F12 + 10% FBS
  2. ~5mL in-house DMEM/F12 + 10% FBS (from early filtration)
  3. ~5mL in-house DMEM/F12 + 10% FBS (from later filtration)

  

3\. Collected the cryovial from Liquid Nitrogen storage & place in foam
floater in water bath for 5 min 7:00 - 7:05  pm

Location where cryovial was collected from:

Vial details:  1    cryovials at  1 M  cells

Brew

Tower/Bucket #1

Box/Cane # 2

Vial location:A9

Vial ID(s):  2288-Culture-6303-Vial-9of115

`4. Ethanol sprayed & transferred the vial(s) to the BSC.`

`5.  Added  500 µL of commercial DMEM/F12 + 10% FBS (to generate a total
volume of 1mL in the cryovial) to the cryovial, resuspended the cell
suspension gently to reduce osmotic shock. `

`6. Collected the entire 1mL of cell suspension & transfer into a 15 mL falcon
tube. Added another  500 µL of commercial DMEM/F12 + 10% FBS to the vial and
transferred this to the falcon tube. From the 1.5mL of cell suspension,
aliquoted 15uL for a cell count.`

`Total cell count was: 1 158 000 `

`175 000 cells = 0.226 uL (needed to seed 1x T25 flask with 7000
cells/cm^2).```  

`7. Transferred 0.226 of the cell suspension to 5 mL of each of the 3 media.
`

`8. Transfered  5 mL to 3x T25 flasks  7:18 pm  `

`9. Transfered flask/plate(s) to incubate at: `

  * [X]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (aviary cells)

  

Making labels

Note - You will need to increase the passage number by one. (i.e. if your
thawed vial ID has a passage number of 3, when you make a culture ID for you
vessel you will need change the passage number to 4 on Airtable.)

Summary:

Revived DOLLY12 WCB fibroblasts into 3x T25 flasks (7000 cells/cm^2) into the
following media conditons:

  1. commercial DMEM/F12 + 10% FBS
  2. in-house DMEM/F12 + 10% FBS (from early filtration)
  3. in-house DMEM/F12 + 10% FBS (from later filtration)




### Results:

  * Results were;
    * [X]  As Usual (this is a repetitive task)
    * [ ]  Unexpected because...
    * [ ]  Need to be further analysed
    * [ ]  Other (.......)
