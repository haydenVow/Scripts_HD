Process:

1\. Place 10 mL  mL of each respective type of Growth Media into the water
bath   14:10

2\. Placed shake tubes in centrifuge and centrifuge at 650 x g for 5 min at
RT.   14:15

3\. Aspirated supernatant from each pellet

4\. Added 1mL of respective growth media to each tube and used a P1000 pipette
to break up cell clumps.

5 .Remaining 9mL of each respective media was added afterwards and triturated
with 10mL serological pipette to break up cell clumps for each culture further
and resuspend cells evenly.

6\. Returned vessel to incubate at:  14:30

  * [X ]  37ÂºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * Incubator (#67 ), Lab [Library]




Observations

All tubes had a large pellet that was easily broken apart by pipetting.




  

Observations:

 100  % media changed on vessel(s)
