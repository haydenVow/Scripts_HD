### Prepared materials:

1\. Aliquotted the required volume of each reagent and then placed all
aliquots to warm in the water bath for a minimum of 20 minutes prior to use:

  1. Aliquots were removed from the fridge and placed at 37 degrees in the waterbath [12:34] [12:53 - E250]
  2. Trypsin for the E500 harvest (4x30mL aliquots) was placed in the waterbath from the freezer at [12:51] [12:55]

Note: if aliquots were placed in water bath at different time, record the time
stamp for each individual solution.




Stained and imaged cells adhered to microcarriers

  1. Removed culture(s) from the incubator and placed them in the BSC  `| 12:30 am/pm|`
  2. Swirled culture(s) by hand on the flat surface of the BSC for 5 seconds, the lid was quickly removed and 3x 20uL samples of the suspension were taken while the liquid was still in motion. This ensured the carriers were evenly mixed at time of sampling.
  3. Transferred the aliquot(s) to wells on a 96 well plate and mixed it with 80uL of dPBS containing  20uL/mL of Hoechst 33342. 
  4. Returned cultures to the incubator  `| 12:36 am/pm|`
  5. Left the 96 well plate to incubate at room temperature, in the dark (away from light), for 12 minutes.  `| 12:48-13:04 am/pm |`
  6. After incubation the wells were inspected under the Axio microscope, 5x objective.
  7. Using https://mia-capture.vow.tools/#/, 3 sets of same frame images using the DAPI and PHASE channels were captured for each well `| : am/pm|`
    1. Manually set the exposure time for DAPI channel to the exposure time seen when carriers are viewed using the automatic exposure adjustment [0.05ms]. (i.e if automatic exposure adjustment reads 0.002ms, set manual adjustment exposure time to be 0.002ms. 
    2. Fluorescence intensity of the UV lamp was adjusted until the centre of each microcarrier was barely visible compared to the space between microcarriers.
  8. Once images were captured, Image pairs were assigned a 'location ID' in MIA capture. (B1-B6) With sets B1-B2 from well 1, B3-B4 from well 2 and B5-B6 from well 3. 
  9. Images captured were then selected for analysis using the 'uCarrier cell count plastic' tool from MIA capture.

## Incubate flask:

  

  1. Stop the shaker
  2. Remove the flask from the BSC and transfer it back to the shaker
  3. Restart the shaker at the `speed required for detachment` \- see the table below.
  4. After `7-15 (E500 -13:12-13:19) (E250 13:45 - 13:52) `minutes, stop the shaker
  5. Remove the flask from the shaker
  6. Restart the shaker
  7. Wipe down the flask with an ethanol-soaked wipe and place it in the BSC

  1. Removed ~200uL of culture media from the E500 flask and placed into a well of a 24 well plate, inspected under the microscope, 4x objective to view assess detachment. Cells appeared mostly detached from the cytodex 1 microcarriers, decided to incubate for a further 3 minutes shaking. [13:21-13:24]
  2. Removed ~200uL of culture media from the E250 flask and placed into a well of a 24 well plate, inspected under the microscope, 4x objective to view assess detachment. Cells appeared mostly detached from the cytodex 1 microcarriers (approx a 60% detachment observed), decided to incubate for a further 5 minutes shaking. [13:57-14:02]




## Neutralize the detachment reagent:

  1. Add fresh, pre-warmed growth medium to the flask
  2. Mix the suspension vigorously
  3. Allow the microcarriers to settle for at least 2 minutes
  4. Gently tilt the flask to an angle of approximately 30 degrees from vertical

# Optional: sieve cell suspension to remove microcarriers

  1. Pass the cell suspension through a 40 - 100 um pore-size sieve to remove any errant microcarriers.




## Recover pellet, prepare suspension for counting and subculture:

  1. Centrifuge the tubes at 650 - 700 RCF for 5 minutes [14:27 - 14:32 (E250)]
  2. Aspirate supernatants
  3. Resuspend pellets in 1 mL of fresh, pre-warmed growth medium
  4. Combine the cell suspensions into 1x 50 mL centrifuge tube
  5. Wash out each tube with the remainder of the fresh, pre-warmed growth medium and combine with the cell suspension

  




## Performed cell count:

  1. Aliquoted     20uL     of resuspended cells into a microcentrifuge tube for cell count.
  2. Performed a cell count using the haemocytometer and recorded the cell count data in the Google Doc spreadsheet called 'Cell Count Spreadsheet' (see link below):

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1DPzKubYxfHmWogVPihC-
SSIBtIylyrBQE5kRX5Z8NtI/edit#gid=0

  1.  Total cell number was:    E500-6718: (5,898,400)   E250-6719: (3,120,000)     

  2. Volume of cell suspension required for subculture was:      E500 (all)  E250 (all)    

  3. Cell density per vessel:     5.8M E500, 3.1M E250    
  4. 

Empty carriers were sampled and stained and labelled under "After Harvest" in
MIA capture for each respective cultures (see Images section below)

Equilibrated E500 was seperated into 2 x E250 by swirling flask and aspirating
60mL at a time and into empty E250 flasks. One E250 was used to seed new
culture coming from #6719 and the other was left in incubator.
