Process:

  1. Grabbed the deep well plates containing DSD conditions from the fridge under the main lab Zaber (Labelled for Saturday). Placed in the Thermo incubator to warm media. 11:20-xx:xx
  2. Take culture plate 1 (6613) out of the incubator as well as the deep well plate 1 with warm media. Peeled off the plate seal from the deep well plate.
  3.  Took up 6 tips with a multichannel pipette and slowly aspirated 50% was media (70uL/well) from plate 1, column 2. With the same tip, adding 70uL/well of media from the corresponding deep well plate. i.e. media from plate 1 column 2 of deep well into culture plate 1 column 2. Then change tips. 
  4. Repeated step 3 for all 10 columns on plate 1.
  5. Resealed the deep well plate with another plate seal  (these can be found next to the Zaber). Stored deep well plate in the fridge (4 degrees C).
  6. Repeated steps 2-5 for plates 2 and 3.
  7. Returned vessel to incubate at: 12:09pm

### Observations/Summary:

 50 % media changed on vessel(s)

6613-DOLLY12-Sheep P11-1of3

6614-DOLLY12-Sheep P11-2of3

6615-DOLLY12-Sheep P11-3of3

  

50% feed with DSD conditions for differentiation

  




### Results

  * Results were;
    * [X]  As Usual (this is a repetitive task)
    * [ ]  Unexpected because...
    * [ ]  Need to be further analysed
    * [ ]  Other (.......)

  

Column 10 of Plate A seems to have less media than the other :(
