This area of research in the maturation team encompasses:

  * Developing infrastructure for high-throughput experiments by introducing liquid handling automation.
  * Developing quantification tools for late-stage maturation markers.

Infrastructure for high-throughput experiments

Previously, the daily feed schedules and maintenance of ongoing experiments
has limited the bandwidth for further strategies to increase maturation but
has also limited the bandwidth for scientists themselves. By introducing
liquid handling automation, we can free up the bandwidth of our scientists to
research and develop alternative strategies to increase the maturation of our
muscle. Furthermore, by mitigating the element of manual pipetting we can
widthstand an increase in experiments as the feeding schedules of these would
be automated. Hence, this area of research will construct the infrastructure
to increase the throughput of our experiments.

Alternative maturation quantification

Over the last two quarter for the muscle maturation project, often it has been
difficult to quantify maturation markers (especially MyoG and MyHC) with
traditional methods such as immunofluorescence (IF) staining. In particular,
with more complex experiments such as those experimenting with mechanical
stimulation (M-stim), microscopy gives rise to large amounts of background
signal and it becomes impossible to obtain precise quantitative data. There
comes an added layer of complexity when adherent cells are imaged as three-
dimensional cultures due to the fluorescence from different focal points on
the culture, bleeding into the plane of interest. Hence, this area of research
will tackle this issue by exploring alternative quantification methods that
are not limited to microscopy.
