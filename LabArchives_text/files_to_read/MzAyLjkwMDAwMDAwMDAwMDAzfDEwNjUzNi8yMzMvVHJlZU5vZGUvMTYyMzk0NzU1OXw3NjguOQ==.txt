In House: Set 6 - 24hr E-flask 6x(2xE250) Harvest


Experiment Plan:




Procedure - E250 Harvest

  1. Pre-weigh 50mL centrifuge tubes recording the weights on the tubes and clearly label with the condition name (one for each flask in each experimental condition = 12)
  2. Pour the contents of each E-flask into their corresponding pre-weighed centrifuge tube. 
  3. Using a serological pipette dispense 10mL dPBS into each flask as a final wash. Add this dPBS to the pre-weighed centrifuge tube with corresponding condition.
  4. Once all aggregates and dPBS has been added to the centrifuge tubes, Centrifuge at 700 x g for 5 minutes.````
  5. Gently remove centrifuge tubes from the machine, ensuring not to disturb the cell pellets. Aspirate as much supernatant as possible from the tubes. Discard supernatant. Remove as much remaining supernatant with a 1mL pipette.
  6. Spin these tubes once more at 700 x g for 5 minutes
  7. Remove any supernatant present with a 1mL pipette
  8. Weigh the cell pellets

  


VitC 50ug/mL - Static (2xE250)


Note/observatons on pellets for all flasks in the STATIC condition at 24h
incubation:

Pellets for 7570, 7543, 7552, 7551 and 7560 flasks had small fragments that
did not quite pellet down. Some were lost when removing the supernatant with a
1000 uL pipette (even when doing this extremely slowly/carefully). This may
have been because the spin was not fast enough to force the cell
aggregate/sheet into a solid pellet. The pellets were moving slightly after
bulk supernatant removal with a 50 mL serological pipette and all had a
slightly textured top surface, not a flattened or smooth one. Small sections
of the former shape could be seen and several folds of the layers could be
made out in the top section of each pellet indicating a retention of the
structure/shape from the E flask. There was some loss of the loose material
upon fine supernatant removal due to this loose pelleting.

  

Note on harvesting and weighing of the pellets in each group:

The static and continuous shaking flasks were harvested together and all spun
down and weighed at the same time. The intermittent shaking group of flasks
were harvested separately (afterwards) as this was too many flasks to handle
at once.
