Single phase lipid extraction was performed following the published work of
Alshery, et al., which has been detailed in SOP "Butanol-
Methano_lipid_extraction_protocol 20211118.docx".

Sample L0001 (Dolly12 Myoblast) and L0002 (C2C12 differentiated) were weighed
and probe sonified on ice. Sample L0003 (lamb backstrap tissue), L0004 (V2
mince) and L0005 (sheep biopsy 20/2/20) have been weighed (kept on dry ice),
homogenised and probe sonified on ice. Sample protein concentrations were then
determined using Qubit assay. Afterwards, the concentrations were adjusted to
2 g/L (except for L0004), as detailed in the table below.

Sample L0004 had low protein level. I will increase the amount of sample and
do protein quantification again next week.

I weighed and prepared more (204.1 mg) sample L0004 hoping to get >2 g/L
protein quantity, so that the protein quanty could match other samples.
Preparation was the same as 26/11/21, details in the table below.

The protein quantity was still <2 g/L. I have tried further increasing the
amount of samples to 455.4 mg, but the sample became jelly-like after
homogenisation and it was hard to perform accurate protein quantification. I
therefore used the above sample for lipid extraction.

Lipid extraction was then performed on sample L0001~L0005, following the SOP
"20211118_BUME_lipid_extraction_protocol.docx ". Briefly, 10 μL of sample
lysates (adjusted to 2 g/L protein, except for sample L0004, which had 1.33
g/L protein) were loaded to Eppendorf tubes, followed by the addition of 100
μL BuME 1:1 solvent w/ 5 mM ammonium acetate. The samples were then vortexed
and put into a water bath sonication for 1 hour (temperature kept <28°C).
Afterwards, the samples were centrifuged for 10 minutes and the supernatants
were transferred to glass vials. Samples are ready for lipidomic analysis.




02/12/2021 & 03/12/2021

The lipidomic analysis was performed using a Sciex #6600 qTOF instrument
(Isfield) coupled with an Exion LC. The methods used for positive and negative
ion modes runs were "20210222_cheka_SWATH_P_Method3.dam"  and
"20210222_cheka_SWATH_N_Method3.dam", respectively. Both runs followed the

After some work on the lipidomic data below are two heatmaps using lipid
identified with positive mode (log10 AUC). One contains lipid classes the
other is all lipid species. As expected, the cell lines samples (L0001 &L0002)
are more similar to each other. Same for the muscle tissues (L003 &L005). V2
mince (L0004) is less similar to other samples. It obviously has more TG and
the composition of phospholipid (and other things) is also quite different.

15/12/21

I have also plotted the negative mode lipid data. Likewise the lipid
composition shows some discrepancies between the muscle tissues, cell lines
and V2 mince.




Heatmap representations of lipid classes (sum of all species sharing a common
head group/structure) and species area-under-curve data, positive and negative
ion modes.




Experimental Aims for the 2nd sample preparation and run for L001-L005:

Following our last discovery lipidomic work, we intended to make further
improvements to the sample preparation and increase the amounts of
tissue/cells used to obtain stronger lipid signals. The following changes have
been made in current experiment:



  1. The amounts of samples used for extraction have been increased by approximate 2.5 times (tissue weight equivalents vs sample L004 prepared on 02/12/2021)
  2. TissueLyser LT homogeniser was used for homogenisation
  3. The Methyl-tert-butyl ether (MTBE) method, instead of the BUME method, was used for lipid extraction, which should extract fibrous tissues (i.e. muscle) better.
  4. Total lipid in the lipid extracts have been determined using the Direct Detect system

If the results are satisfactory, we will stick to this method for subsequent
samples.




16/02/2022

The Direct Detect system can be used to determine sample lipid contents based
on the aliphatic chains within lipid molecules. I tested this function by
using olive and sunflower oils, largely following the Direct Detect manual for
lipid quantification (AN4428EN00-web.pdf). I did not generate and save a
"lipid calibration method" in the Direct Detect system. Instead, I have
generated a calibration curve by exporting the known concentrations of olive
and sunflower oils and their readings, and then generate their respective
calibration curves using Excel (20220216_direct_Detect_test.xlsx). I also have
all the original reports generated by Direct Detect. Notably, the "Lipids
[mg/mL]" columns actually show the reading from Direct Detect, not the mg/mL
values.




18/02/2022 MTBE lipid extraction

Lipid extraction was performed largely following the established Sydney Mass
Spec. "Lipid extraction MTBE method.docx" method. Some modifications were made
to enable the processing of small amounts of samples. Below are the extraction
steps and the bold contents are specific to this experiment (different from
the established method):

Vow Foods Tissue/Cells (L001-L005):

  

1.    Approximately 10 mg of tissue/cells were weighed (see table below for details) and then put into 2 mL Eppendorf tubes. Put homogenisation beads into the tube (L003, L004 and L005).

2.    Add an aliquot of 200 μL 0.01% BHT into each tube. 

3.    Homogenise the tissues (L003, L004 and L005) using a TissueLyser LT (Oscillation: 50; 5min*2). Chill samples before and between the two homogenisations.

4.    Wash the beads with another 100 μL of 0.01% BHT methanol and transfer the homogenates to new 2 mL Eppendorf tubes. 

5.    Sonify the homogenised tissues and cells with a probe sonicator (amp 50% (micro); 15 sec*2).

6.    Add 1 mL of MTBE (methyl-tert-butyl-ether) to the tube and sonicate on ice bath for 30 min. Keep water bath cool. 

7.    Add 250 μL of MilliQ water to each tube to induce phase separation. 

8.    Vortex the sample and spin at 2000 g for 5 min to complete phase separation. 

9.    Transfer the upper organic layer into 2 mL Eppendorf tubes. 

10.   Repeat step 4-8 once (ratio for MTBE:methanol:water = 10:3:2.5) (i.e. 300 μL of methanol, 1mL of MTBE, and 250 μL of water; only the addition of extraction solvents, not the homogenisation and sonication steps) except for L003*3 sample, which was prepared with 2 repetitions (total 3 extractions) for comparison purpose. 

11.  Dry the extracts in a Speedvac, 35 °C, 1.0 mTorr. 

12.  Reconstitute the extract in 200 μL of BUME w/ 10 mM ammonium acetate

13.  Centrifuge the Eppendorf tubes carefully at 2000 g for 10 min to pellet insoluble material, then transfer all (as much) supernatant to a glass LC vial.

14\.  Determine the lipid content of each sample using Direct Detect and pre-
established calibration curves (sunflower oil)

Based on this poster at Lorne Proteomics:

  

Kany Yu send Joon the direct detect files, which he was able to open using the
Bruker software for the Alpha spectrometer:

Joon noted: It seems like the lipid method purely measures the C-H region only
as the spectra are cut off on either side measuring only 3100-2600 so it is
possible you could see improvements by looking at different regions of the
spectra.  The spectra are saturating the detector ~1200 cm-1.

Lipidomic analysis of the above samples were carried out using the identical
SWATH methods from the previous (02/12/2021) run. The batch files for positive
run is "20220223_Vow_L1-5_MTBE_pos.dab". The QC sample was prepared by mixing
sample L001-L005. Solvent system used for this run was solvent A: ACN:H2O =
6:4 \+ 10 mM ammonium acetate/solvent B: ACN:IPA = 1:9 + 10 mM ammonium
acetate. Below are all the positive TIC profiles:

  

Overlay, two and three extractions (L003):

Overalay, sample L001-L005:

Conclusions:

Extractions by twice and three times hardly show any differences at TIC level.
Will only extract twice for future sample preparation.

Substantially stronger TIC signals can be seen with the modifications we have
made regarding sample preparation. The new sample preparation method looks
promising.




25/02/2022

MS-Dial analysis (positive):

LC/MS data analysis was carried out using MS-Dial. All the settings were
identical to 03/12/2021, except that I removed the adduct  "[M+CH3OH+H]+", as
we have not used methanol in our solvent system and therefore should not
detect molecular ions with this adduct. Totally, 4522 lipid features have been
identified in the samples under positive ion mode.




02/03/2022

Negative mode lipidomic run was carried out using the same SWATH method from
02/12/2021. The batch file for positive run was
"20220302_Vow_L1-5_MTBE_neg.dab". The solvent system used was the same as
23/02/2022.
