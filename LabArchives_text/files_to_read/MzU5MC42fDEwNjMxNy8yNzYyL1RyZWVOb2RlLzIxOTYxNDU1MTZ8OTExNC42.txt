Freeze down 1 x biopsy sample in OCT-LN

Biopsy ID = (check main lab label printer) for:

104-Arms/legs-15-Crocodile-QLD

105-Arms/legs-15-Crocodile-QLD

106-Arms/legs-15-Crocodile-QLD

  

Cut Biopsy #1 into 3 x pieces and follow OCT process for those:

processed-06d8d422195a432187d88642f9598326Here's the protocol for what they
will have to do. We need:

  1. OCT mounting solution
  2. 50-100mL ice-cold 0.1% PFA (in PBS, they can make it, but would be good if there was thawed stock)
  3. 10mL syringe plungers
  4. Isopropanol

Isopropanol on main lab staining bench

OCT mountain solution on main lab staining bench

4% PFA in Biomaterials fridge #102 (top shelf in door)

10mL syringe plungers also there (can't remember if I left them on the bench
or in library lab top drawer of plastic cabinet on stock shelf but they are
there somewhere -sorry!)




Procedure

  1. Made up 0.1% PFA in PBS in a 50 mL urine pot and left at 4 degrees. Timestamp 14:30
  2. Trimmed off a small piece of biopsy. 
    * Ideally this should be rectangular in shape with the long side running with the grain of the muscle (so, muscle fibres should run down the long side). The piece should be no more than 10mm X 5mm X 5mm (at most, it needs to be small enough to fit on the end of a syringe)
  3. Placed the piece of muscle into cold 0.1% PFA and put into the refrigerator for 60 mins. Timestamp 19:45
  4. Washed the muscle piece 3 x 5 min in dPBS
    * Timestamp: 20:48 - 20:53
    * Timestamp: 20:54 - 20:59
    * Timestamp: 21:01 - 21:06
  5. Transferred liquid nitrogen from Dewer to a styrofoam esky to a depth of ~3 cm
  6. Filled two urine containers with 30 mL of isopropanol.
  7. Opened a 10 mL syringe plunger and trim the rounded clear, flat end of the plunger into a square shape.
  8. Punched a hole in the lid of all 1.5mL tubes required to store samples using a pair of sterile scissors.
  9. Placed one isopropanol container into the liquid nitrogen. 
  10. Once the isopropanol began to visually freeze (turned white), proceeded with O.C.T mounting.
  11. Placed a biopsy piece onto the face of the trimmed plunger and covered with O.C.T mounting medium.
  12. When ~10% of isopropanol had frozen, dipped the biopsy piece into the isopropanol for 5 seconds.
  13. Used forceps to transfer the frozen sample in OCT to one of the 1.5 mL tubes and placed immediately into liquid nitrogen surrounding the urine container.
  14. Repeated the process for the remaining tissue samples, replacing the isopropanol container if the isopropanol freezes over.
  15. Once all tissue samples are processed, 1.5mL tubes containing sample were placed in labeled urine containers and transferred to the -80 freezer (Library lab - bottom shelf). Timestamp: 21:13




Freeze down 2 x biopsy samples in LN for proteomics/genetic screening

Not completed today due to uncertainty around sample sizes. Stored in Library
Lab Fridge (bar fridge above other bar fridge)

Biopsy IDs = (check main lab label printer) for: (from Biopsy #2)

  * 107-Arms/legs-15-Crocodile-QLD
  * 108-Arms/legs-15-Crocodile-QLD
  * 109-Arms/legs-15-Crocodile-QLD
  * 110-Arms/legs-15-Crocodile-QLD
  * 111-Arms/legs-15-Crocodile-QLD

Collect the biopsy chunk for proteomics (Biopsy #2), cut it up into 5 pieces
with sterile scissors.

Squish those pieces into cryovials (labelled with above labels), and then
flash-freeze those submerged in LN.

  

Repeat for the genomics samples: (from Biopsy #3)

  * 112-Arms/legs-15-Crocodile-QLD
  * 113-Arms/legs-15-Crocodile-QLD
  * 114-Arms/legs-15-Crocodile-QLD
  * 115-Arms/legs-15-Crocodile-QLD
  * 116-Arms/legs-15-Crocodile-QLD

(one frozen in liquid nitrogen for metabolomics/proteomics, one frozen in
liquid nitrogen for genomics)
