### Process:

1\. Took 2-3 images of each vessel with microscope on phase setting at 10X
magnification.

2\. Aliquotted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then
placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath for a minimum of 20 minutes
prior to use:

  1. Growth media:
    1. 11 mL x D/F + 10%FBS + 1xP/S  

    2. 11 mL x D/F + 9%KSR + 1%FBS + 0.1xP/S + FGF-B + IGF-LR3 ~~\+ PDGF-BB  ~~(out of stock)   
To make this aliquot, combined:

      * 9.9 mL of D/F + 10%KSR with 1.1 mL of D/F + 10%FBS + 1xP/S
      * Added 5.9 uL FGF, 10.89 uL IGF ~~and  ~~ ~~24.75 uL PDGF~~ to aliquot (as shown in table below). These growth factors are located in the top drawer of the right hand -20 freezer in Main Lab. See "Media/reagents used" table above to see Mix IDs to ensure you are using the correct growth factors, as there are many with similar names e.g. IGF-2 and FGF-A. 

Time that all aliquots were placed in the incubator to warm before use   13:35  

Note: if aliquots were placed in water bath at different time, record the time
stamp for each individual solution.

  1. Removed 100% of supernatant from vessel. 
  2. Replaced with   5mL (per well/per vessel) of  Growth media. 
  3. Returned vessel to incubate at: 

  * [X]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (aviary cells)

  

  * Incubator (# 120 ), Lab [Main/Library/Production]




### Observations/Summary:

100  % media changed on vessel(s)

  1. 8441-F_DOLLY12-Sheep P13-1of2  
8442-F_DOLLY12-Sheep P13-2of2

  2. 8443-F_DOLLY12-Sheep P13-1of2  
8444-F_DOLLY12-Sheep P13-2of2

Cells in KSR media appear to be slowing down. There are alot of dead cells
present.
