Shark fin soup is a traditional dish with cultural heritage. It is associated
with prestige, prosperity and is believed to have medicinal value. To obtain
the main ingredient of the soup shark finning is required. It is an
unsustainable practice that contributes to the collapse of shark populations
around the world and is incredibly cruel. Thus, an alternative to producing
shark fin soup without the cruelty, but keeping the history and luxury is
required.
