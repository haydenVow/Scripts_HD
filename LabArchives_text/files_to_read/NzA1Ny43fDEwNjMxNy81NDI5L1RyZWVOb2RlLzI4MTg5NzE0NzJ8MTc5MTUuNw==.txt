Media/Reagents used:

NameDetails (reagent ID)  
dPBSM 8241  
  
DAPI (1:1000)M 3220  
  
  
  




Reagent preparation:

  

1\. Prepared DAPI mix:

  50 mL  PBS +  50  uL  of DAPI (1:1000)

Vortexed DAPI mix and stored refrigerated away from light until needed.




Counter staining C2C12 plates (D4/D7)  

Note* 8 x 96-well plates being DAPI stained may result in longer than 5 min
incubation times. The process will happen column-by-column (aspirate dPBS, add
DAPI, then move to next column to repeat the steps). Washes will allow
residual DAPI to be excluded from wells to mitigate.

1\.  Removed dPBS from wells.  12:38 pm

2\.  Washed with DAPI (1:1000) in PBS for 5 min at RT in the dark.

 12:38 - 12:48 pm

3\.  Washed in PBS 2 x 5 min at RT in the dark. (No Triton)

 12:48 - 13:13 pm

 13:13 - 13:34 pm

4\.  Replaced dPBS.

 13:34 pm

5\. Confirmed staining on microscope by imaging.




Counter staining DOLLY plates (D4/D7)  

Note* 8 x 96-well plates being DAPI stained may result in longer than 5 min
incubation times. The process will happen column-by-column (aspirate dPBS, add
DAPI, then move to next column to repeat the steps). Washes will allow
residual DAPI to be excluded from wells to mitigate.

1\.  Removed dPBS from wells.   12:56 pm

2\.  Washed with DAPI (1:1000) in PBS for 5 min at RT in the dark.

 12:56 - 13:05 pm

3\.  Washed in PBS 2 x 5 min at RT in the dark. (No Triton)

 13:05 - 13:24 pm

 13:24 - 13:47 pm

4\.  Replaced dPBS.

 13:47 pm

5\. Confirmed staining on microscope by imaging.
