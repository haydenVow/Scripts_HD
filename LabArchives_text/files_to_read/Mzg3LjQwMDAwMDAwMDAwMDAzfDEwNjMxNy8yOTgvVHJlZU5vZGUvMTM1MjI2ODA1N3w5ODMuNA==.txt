### Process:

1\. Took image of vessel with microscope on phase setting.

2\. Gelatin coated     2     x    2CF      vessel and spare    8     x
T175      with sterile filtered 0.1% gelatin solution and then incubated all
coated flasks at 37˚C.

  1. Time when all vessels(s) placed into the incubator       10:37   a/pm  (2CF)    10:47   a/pm  (8 X T175)  

3\. Aliquotted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then
placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath for a minimum of 20 minutes
prior to use:

  1. TrypLE:     80    mL in   Small Urine Container      tubes
  2.  dPBS (At 37 degrees for washing):     120    mL in   Medium Urine Container     tubes
  3.  dPBS (at RT neutralising):     80    mL in   Small Urine Container     tubes
  4. Growth media (for pellet resuspension):     10    mL in     15mL Centrifuge Tube    tubes
  5. Growth media (for seeding):     600    mL in     500ml Storage Bottle (Corning)    tubes

Time that all aliquots were placed in the water bath the warm before use
11:00   a/pm

Note: if aliquots were placed in water bath at different time, record the time
stamp for each individual solution.




4\. Removed vessel(s) from the incubator     11:28   a/pm

5\. Washed the vessel(s) with dPBS (warmed).

6\. Added     10    mL tryple to each vessel/well and incubated at 37˚C.

  1. Start/Finish for TrypLE was     11:48 - 12:06  a/pm Flask was checked at 11:54am and a 30% detachment was observed and returned to incubator.  

7\. Neutralised with     10mL     dPBS and combined cell suspension into a   3
x 50mL Centrifuge Tubes       tube.

8\. Centrifuged at 650 x g for 5 min.

  1. Start/Finish time for centrifugation was     12:17 - 12:22   a/pm 




9\. Aspirated the supernatant(s).

10\. Resuspended pellet(s) in     6    mL    Growth Media      media     12:34
a/pm

11\. Aliquoted     10uL     of resuspended cells into a microcentrifuge tube
for cell count.

12\. Performed a cell count using the haemocytometer and recorded the cell
count data in the Google Doc spreadsheet called 'Cell Count Spreadsheet' (see
link below):

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1DPzKubYxfHmWogVPihC-
SSIBtIylyrBQE5kRX5Z8NtI/edit#gid=0

  1.  Total cell number was:      6576000       

  2. Volume of cell suspension required for subculture was:      4mL       

  3. Cell density per vessel:          




13\. Transferred       4    ml of cell suspension to the pre-warmed      600mL
mL Growth media:      13:05    a/pm

14\. Transferred cell suspension into the pre-gelatin coated      2 x 2CF
vessel.

15\. Left at RT in the BSC for 30 min to allow cells to settle      13:07  -
13:42 a/pm  

16\. Transferred vessel(s) to incubate at:

  * [x]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells) thermo incubator
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (avian cells)

17\. Total cell suspension was 6mL, 4mL was used to seed 2 x 2CF at the
appropriate seeding density leaving a remaining 2mL of cell suspension
containing roughly `2158666` cells

18\. The remaining cell suspension (2mL) was used to seed 8 x T175s.

19\. 300mL of Growth Media was placed in the water bath at 13:11 for 20
minutes and then 240mL was aliquotted out for the seeding of 8 x T175s. While
gelatin was removed from the 8 x T175s, the 2mL cell suspension was left at 4
degrees so as to preserve the cell suspension.

20\. 120uL of p38i was added to the 240mL of growth media.

21\. The remaining 2mL of cell suspension was transferred to the 240mL of
growth media and 30mL aliquots were added to each T Flask and left to set in
the BSC for 30 minutes 13:50 - XX:XX
