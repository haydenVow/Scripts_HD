Aim:


To screen 24 maturation inducing DSD factors (separately and in high to low
concentrations) and identify factors to take towards the final DSD.


Hypothesis:


This experiment will shed light on whether high concentrations and/or
combination effects of our factors are causing death/inhibiting maturation.


Technical gap:


In our first maturation DSD experiment, we observed inhibited maturation and
cell death in most condition wells while control wells look viable.
Currently, we are not clear on whether the cell death observed in most
conditions in DSD #1 is due to:

  * Excessively high concentrations of each factor for cell culture.
  * Factor-factor effects from multiple combinations.
  * High pH imbalances due to the acidic nature of many factors.


Plan:


Background:

By screening all 24 factors individually and at multiple lower concentrations,
we should be able to screen and identify which factors to take forward to a
final DSD which assesses their combinatorial effects. Four iterations of 1:5
dilutions of the recommended concentrations will enable us to find the optimal
concentration for any beneficial factor. The statement we confidently wish to
answer at the end of this experiment is:

" Factor _ in a concentration of _ mg/mL promotes/inhibits a _% increase in
the maturation process "

This experiment will implement each factor at the recommended concentrations
as a control for what would be used in a DSD otherwise. The most diluted
concentration of the factor should serve as a "negative control" where we
ideally would see little to no increase in maturation. Thus, by specifically
outlining clear boundaries of the concentration range, we will be able to
identify the range where the factor should perform optimally.

Day < 1: Making up stocks in E6:

  * Make up 48mL of E6 (1X P/S) (24 conditions x 2 mL each = 48 mL)
  * Make concentrated stock solutions in 1.8mL microfuge tubes as directed by the DSD mixing spreadsheet here (factors in DSD #1) and here (factors in DSD #2) at the target STOCK concentration.

  

  * Figure 1: The respective stock concentrations in DSD #1  
  
Figure 2: The respective stock concentrations in DSD #2  
  
  

  

  * In 24 separate 1.8mL microfuge tubes, add the designated amount of concentrated stock of each factor to a pre-aliquoted volume of E6 as per the spreadsheet. This will be the working stock (1X) concentration.
  * Some concentrated stocks will require a 1:10 dilution due to the initial volume to add to E6 is < 1uL.
  * Sterile filter each of these working stocks. 
  * Aliquot these into a designated 96-well deep well media block for serial dilution.




Day < 1: Serial dilution of working stocks

  * Row A and Row E contain the concentrated stock that we have used/planning to use in DSD #1 and DSD #2.
  * These will be serially diluted in several rows underneath to make 1:5 dilutions in each iteration (see table below)

Day 0 - 7: Differentiation and maturation

  * Deep well media block should contain more than enough media for 7 days of differentiation (< 1mL).
  * Block should be sealed with adhesive rubber mat for sterility and foil wrapped to protect light sensitive components from fluorescent light.
  * Ideally, plates should be Zaber scanned every day.
  * Feed plates with 140uL/well of the appropriate condition by performing a 1 to 1 direct transfer using a multichannel pipette each day.  




Day 8: Fix, stain and analysis

  * Fix plate with 4% PFA and then proceed with primary and secondary staining as per standard protocol.
  * Zaber scan plate using AF488, AF555 and DAPI fluorescent channels.
  * Run images through %MyoG macro embedded in MIA capture to determine MyoG content in each well
  * Identify well performing factors at the respective concentrations.
