Process (make up hydrolysate mixture):

1\. Retrieve hydrolysates from the cell expansion fridge and/or ambient
storage cabinet:  
\- Difco soy hydrolysate S#3492  
\- Bacto malt extract S#3493  
\- Pea peptone S#3764  
\- Wheat peptone S#3760  
\- Lupin peptone S#3762  
2\. Weigh out 10 g of each hydrolysate.  
2\. Add the 10 g powder to 100 mL of Milli-Q water. According to this
technical sheet the hydrolysates should be soluble in purified water and the
solution should appear to be clear to slightly hazy.  
3\. Sterile filtered the dissolved hydrolysate solution through a 0.22 um
filter unit. This concentrate can then be used to add the hydrolysates into
the growth media.  
5\. Store solution at 4'C for 2-4 weeks.
