Fix, DAPI & Image 96-well-plate (1)


Procedure

Fixing & Staining ( ~ 45-50min)

  1. Remove media from each well and gently wash twice with 200uL dPBS.
    * When removing liquid: Be careful to keep the pipette tip as close to the side of the well as possible to avoid scrapping off cell from the middle of the well.
    * When adding liquid: Always gently eject the liquid down the side of the well wall ensuring that the tip is toward to top of the well and not near the base. Placing the pipette tip too close to the base can blast the cells off the well surface and invalidate the assay.
  2. Add 100uL/well PFA for 15 min.   

  3. Remove PFA (use PFA waste container) and wash wells with 100uL dPBS for 5 mins.
  4. Stain cells with 100uL DAPI (diluted 1:1000 in dPBS) for 5 mins.
    * If possible perform this step and all successive steps in a low light setting to aviod bleaching of the DAPI fluorescence. 
    * Be sure to keep the plate in a dark box away from light for any waiting time once DAPI is added to the wells.  

  5. Wash wells three times with 100uL dPBS for 5 mins each. 
  6. Remove last wash and Add 100uL dPBS per well
  7. Parafilm the plate and Image cells using the Zaber for DAPI
  8. Cover with foil and store in the fridge.
    * If Zaber imaging does not occur directly after completing the fix and DAPI procedure, parafilm the plate, cover it in foil and store it in the fridge until the Zaber imaging can be performed. 
    * Ensure the plate is labeled (on the foil) with the proliferation assay name (Eg. Proliferation assay IH-004) the assay day (eg. D1) and the date the fix and DAPI procedure was performed. 


50% Feed on 3 x 96-well plates and 50% Feed on 2 x T25


# Procedure

  1. Turn on the water bath and set to 37'C.
  2. Aliquot  required growth media into a sterile container/s and place into the water bath.
  3. Place in the water bath and heat for at least 20 minutes.
  4. Observe the cell flasks for confluence under the microscope using 4 x magnification and take images as required. Note: The confluence of cells must be <50% to perform cell feeding in P1-P3 and <80% in P4 prior to the cell differentiation stage. 
  5. Transfer flasks to the BSC and remove required volume of media from each flask (according to the Table above).
  6. Replace the same volume into each flask with the prepared growth media.
  7. Return the flasks to the incubator.
