### Process:

1\. Took image of vessel with microscope on phase setting.

3\. Aliquotted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then
placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath for a minimum of 20 minutes
prior to use:

  1. TrypLE:     10.5    mL in     1    tubes
  2.  dPBS (for neutralising):     10.5    mL
  3.  dPBS (for washing):     7    mL
  4. Growth media (for pellet resuspension):     5    mL
  5. Growth media (for seeding):      30   mL 

Time that all aliquots were placed in the water bath the warm before use
15: 25  

Note: if aliquots were placed in water bath at different time, record the time
stamp for each individual solution.




4\. Removed vessel(s) from the incubator   15:46  

5\. Washed the vessel(s) with dPBS (warmed).

6\. Added      10   mL tryple to each vessel/well and incubated at 37˚C.

  1. Start/Finish for TrypLE was     15:50 - 16:05  

7\. Neutralised with    10      dPBS and combined cell suspension into a
50mL      tube.

8\. Centrifuged at 650 x g for 5 min.

  1. Start/Finish time for centrifugation was    16 : 09 - 16:14  




9\. Aspirated the supernatant(s).

10\. Resuspended pellet(s) in     4   mL     growth     media     not recorded  

11\. Aliquoted      10 uL    of resuspended cells into a microcentrifuge tube
for cell count.

12\. Performed a cell count using the haemocytometer and recorded the cell
count data in the Google Doc spreadsheet: Cell Count Spreadsheet or cell count
widget below

  1. Total cell number was:     7 232 000 cells       

  2. 1 225 000 cells = (for seeding T175 flask)  

    1. add this to 30 mL of media to be able to seed 7000 cells/cm^2.  

  3. 198 000 cells = (for seeding 384 wp)   

    1. add this to 22 mL of media to be able to seed 8036 cells/cm^2, 450 cells/well when 50uL/well is used    




13\. Seed a T175 flask and 384 well plate using the prepared cell suspension
as detailed above.

15\. Left at RT in the BSC for 30 min to allow cells to settle     16 : 55  

16\. Transferred vessel(s) to incubate at:

  * [X]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (avian cells)




Observations/Summary:

Passaged 1x T175 flask and seeded 1x T175 flask and 1x 384 wp.
