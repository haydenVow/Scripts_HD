## Reagent Prep

Live staining with CMFDA: SEE GUIDE ON CMFDA STAINING HERE  

Preparation of stock and and working solutions for CMFDA Cell Tracker

1\. Remove the CMFDA powder from the freezer (main lab) and allow it to warm
to room temperature. Each aliquot is 50 ug.

  1.  Briefly centrifuge the tube to pellet the CMFDA powder

2\. Add 50 uL high-quality, anhydrous DMSO to the powder and pipette up and
down until well suspended. This will yield a 1 mM CFDA stock solution.

  1. NOTE - Once prepared, the DMSO stock solution should be stored at -20'C in a 70 mL pot submerged in silica-gel desiccant beads for a short period for one series of experiments. If a large amount of stock solution is left, then any remaining solution should be aliquoted and frozen at < \- 20°C. Avoid repeated freeze-thaw cycles, and protect from light. 




## Sample Selection

  1. Using sterile tweezers, select 1 "meatball"from each cup in rows 1 and 2
    1. row 3 is cell-free and does not need to be treated
  2. transfer into a new well on a 96w or 24w plate prefilled with warm PBS (to remove media and serum if any)
  3. Proceed with CMFDA protocol as below




## CMFDA protocol

  1. Aliquot    1     mL PBS for washing the samples and place in waterbath   11:30  . (This is only necessary for samples containing serum as serum interferes with the CMFDA stain)
  2. Transfer    4    uL of the 1mM CMFDA stock solution to    2     mL of prepared PBS in a light safe falcon tube to protect it from light. 
  3. Vortex to ensure thorough mixing with the resulting solution being approximately 2 uM CMFDA working solution. (2uL of 1mM CMFDA stock solution: 1mL of D/F media.)
  4. Place in the water bath to be pre-warmed   11:30am    

  5. Add    0.5     mL of pre-warmed PBS to the wells from each plate as a rinse step to remove any residual serum.
  6. Aspirate the rinsing media 
  7. Add    1 (each well)     mL of pre-warmed CMFDA working solution to the samples and incubate for 30 minutes at 37'C covered in foil to protect samples from light.
    1. Start/Finish time was:  11:45 - 12:15pm   

    2. If the CMFDA working solution is no longer required dispose of solution as aqueous waste as aqueous solutions of CMFDA are susceptible to hydrolysis and should be used within one day.
  8. Remove    1000     uL of staining solution from each well
  9. Image all wells from plates on the Zaber fluorescence microscope or AXIO (channel AF488 for CMFDA [Live cells]). Remember to image both sides or use z-stacking (200 uM slices for 3mm meatballs)
    1. Alternatively, image representative areas on the Axio at relevant magnification




Process:

  1. Warm up pre-aliquotted  E6 Media  in 24w plate ( 1.5 mL per well approx) 
    1. if media is provided in tube, plate out 1.5 mL per well into a new 24wp a per platemap
  2. Placed tube in waterbath or plate in incubator for > 30min at   11:54 a/pm    

  3. Removed sample plates from the incubator and place in BSC (lights off)
  4. transferred sample plate (tray with cups) and feed plate into BSC.
  5. Remove parafilm from feed and sample plate. 
  6. Transferred all samples to fresh media plate by lifting tray over to new plate
  7. Parafilmed sample plates and returned vessel to incubate at:      a/pm    

  * [X]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (avian cells)
