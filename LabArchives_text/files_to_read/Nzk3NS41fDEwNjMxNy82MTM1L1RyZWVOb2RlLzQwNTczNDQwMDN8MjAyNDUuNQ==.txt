Prepare guides/cas9/Cas9 electroporation enhancer

  1. Resuspend guide RNA in 1 x TE buffer to a final concentration of 44 uM (store at -20)
  2. Make up Cas9 mix. Below is a 1 x mix for 1 well, multiply by number of wells you intend to make x 1.25 to get total volume required for experiment.

ComponentAmount (uL)  
Alt-R Cas9 (62 uM stock)0.3  
Buffer R0.2  
Total volume0.5  
  
3\. Make up the Cas9 + guide mix. Below is a 1 x mix for 1 well, multiply by
number of wells you intend to make x 1.25 to get total volume required for
experiment.

Component Amount (uL)  
sgRNA in TE buffer (44uM)0.5  
Cas9 in R buffer (36 uM from above)0.5  
Total volume1  
  
4\. Incubate mix for 10-20 min

5\. while incubating, prepare the electroporation enhancer

  1. resuspend in 1 x TE to get to a 100 uM stock solution (first use only)
  2. make up mix for each experiment of a 10.8 uM solution using 1 x TE buffer. Below is a 1 x mix for 1 well, multiply by number of wells you intend to make x 1.25 to get total volume required for experiment.

Component Amount (uL)  
Electroporation enhancer (100 uM)0.22  
1 x TE buffer 1.78  
Total volume 2  
  
  

  




Prepare Cells for nucleofection

  1. Prepare 6 well plates to receive nucleofected cells. You will need 3 wells per condition. Fill the number of wells required with 3 mL of DMEM/F12 + 20% FBS WITHOUT ANTIBIOTICS! 
  2. Place in incubator to warm plates with media. 
  3. Use cells that are of a low passage number, have been thawed and out of frozen storage for at least 3 days and appear happy and live. 
  4. Remove media from cells, PBS wash with             mL PBS and triplise with           mL tryple
  5. Neutralise tryple with             mL PBS. 
  6. Place cells in a falcon tube 
  7. Perform a cell count [Cell count               cells/mL)
  8. Determine the number of cells required for the experiment. You will need 0.5 x 10^5 cells per well. Therefore for each condition you will need 1.5 x 10^6. However it is best to prepare extra in case of pipetting errors. Therefore 2 x 10^6 cells per condition are ideal. 
  9. Pipette out the number of mL of cells required for the number of cells you need [             mL used for experiment]
  10. Centrifuge at 300g for 10 mins at room temp [time in centrifuge             ]
  11. Remove supernatant
  12. Resuspend pellet in         mL 1x PBS 
  13. Centrifuge at 300g for 5 mins at room temp [time in centrifuge            ] 
  14. Remove supernatant. It is important to remove as much as possible. Use a 1 mL tip to remove most of the supernatant and then switch to a 200 uL pipette to remove a little more if necessary. Do not disturb the pellet.
  15. Resuspend pellet in            uL R buffer (9uL R buffer per 5 x 10^5 cells)
  16. Move cells into different 1.5 mL epindorf tubes for the different conditions being nucleofected. For each nucleofection make up a mixture as follows:

ComponentAmount (uL)  
RNP complex from above1  
Cells in R buffer9  
10.8 uM electroporation enhancer2  
Total12  
  
17\. Set up nucleofection machine and retrive 6 well plates from incubator

18\. Insert neon tip into the mix from above and draw up cell mix

19\. Electroporate with the 3 conditions below
