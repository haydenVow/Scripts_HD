1\. Use microcarriers to expand cells throughout the cell bank generation
process (so that cells are already adapted to microcarrier culture for use in
downstream processes)

2\. Focus on picking best clones (so that cells give consistent proliferation
and differentiation behavior in downstream processes)

3\. Demonstrate differentiation at one or more points in the clonal cell bank
generation process (so that genuinely myogenic clones are available for use in
downstream processes)  

4\. Demonstrate the ability to expand WCB2 clones at least 10 doublings on
microcarriers, then differentiate and fuse clones (so that WCB2 users have
confidence in the proliferative and myogenic capacity of clones)
