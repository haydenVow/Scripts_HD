RELATED TO MILESTONE:  

Milestone 2: To have completed the experimental work on at least two DoE's
with multiple inputs [from cells, media, biomaterials and/or microcarriers).

As the development of new scaffolds will directly feed into the generation of
biomaterial DoE's.

AIM/PURPOSE: To identify whether freeze-drying can provide us with stable,
porous and cell compatible scaffold structures.

HYPOTHESIS: Freeze-drying will allow us to form table, porous and cell
compatible scaffold structures using a variety of biomaterials.

RESULTS SUMMARY: "See Report".

CONCLUSIONS: What were the overall findings? This should be a concise summary
and not duplicate the information in the results/report. For example "We found
that Bovine MuSCs could only achieve a cell density 50% of that observed with
planar culture without undergoing precocious differentiation. These results
mean that we are currently limited to X cells/ml in suspension culture until
we find a way to inhibit precocious differentiation"

NEXT STEPS: This should be a dot point list of any immediate outcomes, changes
to SOPs, as well as providing a direct link to any new experiments arising
from these findings. Importantly, this section should also include any
potential DEPLOYMENTS to the production team
