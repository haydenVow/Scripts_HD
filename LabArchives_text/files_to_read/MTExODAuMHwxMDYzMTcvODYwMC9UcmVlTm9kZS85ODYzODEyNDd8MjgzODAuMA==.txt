Aim


To further explore the occurrence of the plugs (hence known as "pork buns")
that resulted from the autoclaving of a biogel formulation (2% Alginate, 1%
Xanthan, 1% Glucomannan, 2% Methocellulose).

Main goals:  
\- Recreate the incidence of the "plugs"

\- Determine how the "plug" is formed

  

ADD PICTURE OF PLUG


Hypothesis


When the biogel is dehydrated at 70C for 2 hrs it will recreate the plug.


Method


See Pork Bun Gel Creation in "20 JUN 22 - Steamed Pork Buns 1"

 Dehydration

1\. A piece of gel from the previous experiment was obtained of various
weights and placed on parchment paper.

  

2\. The dehydrator was set to 70C and the gels were place inside for 2 hours.

3\. The weight of the gel was measured after 2 hours.

Observations

All gel pieces significantly decreased in size. No white plugs were formed.

  

  


Conclusion


Gels significantly decreased in weight. Steam may be a crucial component in
the formation of gel plugs.
