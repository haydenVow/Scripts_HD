Process:

### Step 1: Fix wells with 4% PFA

  1. Removed flask(s)/plate(s) from the incubator.    11:45   a/pm   
  2. Removed media and washed wells with    200uL   non-sterile dPBS.  
  3. Remove wash and wash once more with     200uL  non-sterile dPBS. 
  4. Remove dPBS and add    100uL   of 4% PFA and incubate at RT for 15 minutes.   1:08  \-  1:23  a/pm  
  5. Remove the PFA and wash wells twice with    200uL   dPBS.  
  6. Remove dPBS and replaced with fresh    200uL   of dPBS 
  7. Proceed to primary antibody or store the plates at 4 degrees parafilmed until ready for immunostaining.

### Step 2: Permeabilise and block cells

Permeabalise:

*Culture 8183 is being primary and secondary stained*

1\. Removed PBS from each well.

2\. Added   100  uL PBST (0.2% Triton-X) to each well for 15 min:    10:04  \-
10:19  a/pm  

3\. Aspirated PBST for each well.

  

Block

1\. Added  100  uL of blocking buffer (3% BSA in PBST [0.1% Triton-X]) and
incubate for 45 minutes - 1hr at RT. (no more than 1 hour).    10:22  -  11:22
a/pm  

2\. While incubating, prepare primary antibody solutions (see next steps)

### Step 3: Primary stain cells

Prepare Antibody solution(s)

Use this spreadsheet to:

  * Determine the total amount of regent required for primary staining
  * Provide more information on antibody types

3\. Prepared Primary Antibody Mixes as desired and noted information in table
above.

Pipette-mixed antibody mix and stored refrigerated away from light until
needed. DO NOT VORTEX ANTIBODIES!!

  

Single/Simultaneous Primary Antibody staining

1\. Removed blocking buffer from each well

2\. Added     50  uL  of primary antibody solution.

2\. Incubated cells with primary antibody for 90min - 2hrs at RT, or 4ºC
overnight:   11:30  -  13:00  a/pm  

3\. Parafilmed plates and stored at 4ºC in fridge.

After this step, all further task should be performed in a dark room. The
vessel should also be wrapped foil when not used.

  1. Prepared ELISA and fluorescent secondary antibody mixes as per the table above (pipette from the top/supernatant of antibody solution)
    1. If using AlexaFluor fluorescent secondary antibodies then the max concentration should be 1:500 (typically used at 1:1000)
    2. Pipette-mixed antibody mix and stored refrigerated away from light until needed.
  2. Removed sample vessels from fridge (if incubated in primary antibodies overnight).
  3. Washed 3,4 or 5 times for 5 min with ELISA Wash Buffer at RT.

  13:02  -  13:08  a/pm  

  13:10  \-  13:15  a/pm  

  13:18  \-  13:23  a/pm  

  13:26  \-  13:31  a/pm  

  13:32  \-  13:38  a/pm  

  13:40  \-  13:46  a/pm  

    4\. Incubated respective wells with corresponding secondary antibody mixtures in the dark at RT for 1 hour.    14:03  -  15:03  a/pm     
  
From this step onwards protect from the light by wrapping plates in foil and
perform experiment in the dark




### Step 3: Enzymatic reaction (TMB substrate conversion)

Please note critical steps to ELISA workflow are highlighted in
bold/underlined.

  1. Removed 2nd antibody solution.     15:05   a/pm    
  2. Washed in  200 uL   dPBS 4, 5 OR 6 times for 5 min at RT in the dark. (No Triton)  
  15:09  \-  15:15  a/pm  
  15:20  \-  15:25  a/pm  
  15:28  \-  15:33  a/pm  
  15:37  \-  15:42  a/pm  
  15:46  \-  15:51  a/pm  
  3.   15:46  \-  15:51  a/pm  
  4.   15:55  -  16:00  a/pm  
  5. Started peroxidase reaction by adding     75uL  of TMB substrate solution to respective wells and incubated plate at RT for 15 mins.  
  16:10  -  16:25  a/pm  
  6. Quenched reaction with an equal volume of 0.5 M HCl or   75  uL   STRICTLY after 15 minutes and observed cyan to yellow colour change.
  7. Pipette mixed and transferred   100uL   of the yellow supernatant to a non-treated 96 well plate.  
Do not use a cell culture treated 96 well plate!  
If continuing with Janus Green stain, wash original plate immediately with PBS
(see Janus Green staining template for more detail)

  8. Spun down plate in centrifuge for 1 min at 1000 rpm to remove bubbles and droplets.
  9. Placed plate in NanoStar plate reader and measured absorbance values at 450nm (ELISA 405 preset program).
