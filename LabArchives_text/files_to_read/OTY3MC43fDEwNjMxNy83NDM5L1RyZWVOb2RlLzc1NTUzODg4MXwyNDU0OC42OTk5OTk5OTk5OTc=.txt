Process:

1\. Aliquotted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then
placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath for a minimum of 20 minutes
prior to use:

  1. TrypLE:    20   mL in  1     tubes
  2. dPBS (for neutralising)      40 mL in    1    tubes
  3. Growth media (for pellet resuspension):    5   mL in     1  tubes
  4. Growth media (for seeding):    20   mL in   1x 50mL falcon     tubes
  5. Times that all aliquots were placed in the water bath to warm before use    14:20    

Note: if aliquots were placed in water bath at different times, record the
time stamp for each individual solution.




2\. Washed the flask(s) with dPBS.

3\. Added   10    mL tryple to each vessel/well and incubated at 37˚C for
10   min   15:25-15:35  

Note: Fibroblasts typically require 15-18 minutes of incubation with tryple,
slightly longer than MuSCs.

4\. Neutralised with   10    dPBS (warmed) and combined cell suspension into a
1x50mL falcon   tube.

5\. Centrifuged at 650 x g for 5 min

  1. Start/Finish time for centrifugation was    15:45    \-    15:50  a/pm 




6\. Aspirated the supernatant(s)

7\. Resuspended pellet(s) in     2x aliquots of 600ml (total 1200mL)  Of
DMEM+10%FBS+VITC+1XP/S    media.

8\. Performed a cell count using the haemocytometer and recorded the cell
count data in widget or the Google Doc spreadsheet called 'Cell Count
Spreadsheet' (see link below):

9\. Total cell number was: 38,880,000  

10\. Seeded at 1750 cells/ cm^2   ~~~7k cells per cm2 of the flasks/plates.
Note that fibroblasts prefer to be subcultured closely together. ~~  

12\. Transfer   20mL (entire volume) of cell suspension to the pre-warmed 1200
mL Growth Media.

13\. Transfer cell suspension into (non-gelatin coated)  2x 4CF
flasks/plates.

14\. Transfer flask/plate(s) to incubate at:

  *  ~~[ ]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)~~
  *  ~~[ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (aviary cells)~~ ~~~~  
  

  * being incubated at 37 ºC, 5% CO2 despite being an avian cell line
