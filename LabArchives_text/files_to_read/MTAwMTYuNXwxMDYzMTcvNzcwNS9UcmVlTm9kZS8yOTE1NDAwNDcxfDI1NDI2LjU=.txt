Process:

 1\. Aliquotted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and
then placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath for a minimum of 20 minutes
prior to use:

  1.  TrypLE:  60 mL in 3 x 70 ml urine pots
  2.  dPBS (for neutralising)  60 ml  in 3 x 70 ml urine pots
  3.  dPBS (for pellet resuspension for those flasks going into suspension culture):   30 mL in 1 x 70 ml urine pot
  4. Hycell Cho + KSR + GFs (IGF-IL3 + FGF):15 ml 
  5. Cryostor: 6 ml
  6.  Time that all aliquots were placed in the water bath to warm before use:   10:15 am - 13:20 pm 

Note: if aliquots were placed in water bath at different times, record the
time stamp for each individual solution.




2\. Washed the flask(s) with 10 ml dPBS/vessel.

3\. Added 10mL tryple to each vessel/well and incubated at 30ºC for 8 min

4\. Neutralised with 10 ml dPBS (warmed) and combined cell suspension into 6 x
50 ml tube.

5\. Centrifuged at 400 x g for 5 min  




6\. Aspirated the supernatant(s) from all 6 x 50ml tubes.

7\. Resuspend 6 x 50 ml tubes (each containing nucleofected cells subject to a
different condition) in 7 ml dPBS and transfer to 6 x 15 ml tubes.

8\. Performed a cell count using the haemocytometer and recorded the cell
count data in the Google Doc spreadsheet called 'Cell Count Spreadsheet' (see
link below):

SSIBtIylyrBQE5kRX5Z8NtI/edit#gid=0

Total cell number was:

CDKN1B (suspension): 3,300,000 cells

CDKN1B + ZIC1 (suspension): 5,460,000 cells (4.579 ml were taken for
suspension culture to have 5M cells in 5 ml)

Control (suspension): 4,250,000 cells

*We inferred the volume of cell suspension required to freeze down 200k cells at -80C for RNA extraction from the counts performed for the suspension cultures given we harvested 1 x T175 for each:

 CDKN1B: 303 uL

CDKN1B + ZIC1: 183 uL

Control: 235 uL

9\. Spin down the remaining cell suspension in the 3 x 15 ml tubes. Carefully
aspirate the supernatant and resuspend in 2 ml of Cryostor (chilled, to reduce
DMSO toxicity).

10\. Aliquotted 1 mL into each cryovial (already labelled).

11\. Tightened the lids & transfer the cryovials to a Mr. Frosty immediately
into the -80ºC freezer.    pm

12\. Allow the cells to freeze for at least 18-24 hours before transferring to
Liquid Nitrogen storage.

16\. Calculate the required volume of cell suspension for a 50 ml shaker tube
suspension culture (5M cells/50 ml shaker tube).

CDKN1B:

CDKN1B + ZIC1:

Control:

17\. Spin down the cell suspension at 400g for 5 min.

18\. Resuspend each of the cell pellets (there should be 3; 1 per condition)
in pre-warmed Hycell Cho + KSR + GFs and transfer to shaking incubator set at
150 rpm (slow speed).




Observations/Summary:

\- Instead of removing the supernatant of all conditions prior to adding the
cryostor into the 50 ml tube and then into the cryovial, I did one condition
at a time. This may have affected the viability of those cells that were in
cryostor (in Mr. Frosty) for too long.

\- I was a bit worried when I centrifuged my cells to then resuspend them in
cryostor that I couldn't see a cell pellet.
