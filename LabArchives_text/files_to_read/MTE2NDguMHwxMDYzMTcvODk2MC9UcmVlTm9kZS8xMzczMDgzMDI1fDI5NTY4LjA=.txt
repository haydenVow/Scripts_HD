Methods and Experiment Layout


Experiment layout

We will attempt to seed four tissue discs. Each disc will be a single
replicate (condition). Conditions will be as follows:

  1. 0.1M NaOH used in gel matrix, (conditions to set gel: 37C, 5%CO2)
  2. 0.1M NaOH used in gel matrix, (conditions to set gel: Ambient, 5%CO2)
  3. 0.1M NaOH used in gel matrix, (conditions to set gel: 37C, 5%CO2) with cell resuspension in growth media (listed in table above) with the addition of 1:100 HEPES buffer solution. 
  4. 0.2M NaOH used in gel matrix, (conditions to set gel: 37C, 5%CO2) 

  

Figure 1. Plate Map for Tissue Discs Experiment B, to determine the optimum
acidity levels of large scale tissue disc cultures. There are 4 conditions
(n=1) with the condition details outlined within the figure. All culture will
have a cell density of 40M cells/ml with a gel matrix volume of 25ml.

Cell Supply Harvest and Matrix Formation for Seeding


## Preparation for Harvest

  1. Prepare 4 falcon tubes for cell harvest for 4 conditions of different cell densities (20M and 40M cells/mL) and 2 different seeding volumes (20mL and 25mL).
    1. Completed calculations can be found here
  2. Media preparation for harvest and seeding: 
    1. DMEM/F12 growth medium as above (table 1). 

## Cell Harvest for Mould seeding - Nuvonis suspension protocol

  2.  ~~Count cells with haemocytometer/Vicell for total yields:~~

Total Volume Used (mL)1232N/A  
Cell Concentration (cells/mL) 3.25 MN/A  
  4. Pour required volume of cell suspension for 1 tissue disc into 500mL centrifuge tubes:
    * 1B cells in  308  mL from #1232
  5. Centrifuge at 500g for 5 minutes (in 500mL centrifuge tubes) 
  6. Resuspend the pellet in 50mL of growth medium in a 50mL falcon tube and centrifuge at 300g for 5 minutes.  
  7. Resuspend pellets in each centrifuge tubes in    12.1 mL   DMEM/F12 growth medium TOTAL (first resuspend in 5mL to account for pellet volume to make up to a total of 12.1ml)
    * NOTE: Resuspending the pellet is very thick and viscous and takes up a high volume. 
  8.  ~~Add required volume of cells+media to 4 falcon tubes~~ :
  9. Proceed to matrix additions below. 
    1. Bring out matrix additives from the fridge only until ready to use. 
  10. Repeat step 4-8 for each tissue. 

## Matrix formation for scaffold seeding - 2 cell densities + 2 tissue gel
volumes

N.B. Repeat this gel formation for each falcon tube at the same time - i.e.
Add Collagen to all, then add DMEM to all etc. - BUT be sure to move quickly!
Refer to Figure 2 to visualise the workflow.

1. Remove pluronic from the wells.

(25mL tissue gel)  
n=1 tissue disc

 Step 2. Add total Collagen (mL)10.15  
Step 3. Add total 10xDMEM/F12  
(mL)1.225  
Step 4. Add total  NaOH  
(mL)1.525  
Step 5. Pipette matrix into each well 25  
  
5\. Seed gel/matrix gently into scaffold ensuring good distribution around
pillars in the well.

6. Leave for    60-90    minutes to gel at 37°C - start time 

Duration left to gel:

  * Condition 1 (Control): 3 hours 20 minutes
  * Condition 2 (Control gel matrix set at Ambient conditions): 3 hours 20 minutes
  * Condition 3: (Gel Matrix containing HEPES in cell+growth media suspension): 2 hours and 30 minutes
  * Condition 4: (Gel Matrix containing 0.2M NaOH solution): 2 hours and 30 minutes

Note (from Alex W 21/07/22): Add Growth media to the entire dish at or before
the 3 hour time point (post-seeding as the gel matrix environment begins to
become stressful and prohibitive for cell viability, especially when each
tissue disc has a high density (1B per disc at 40M cells/mL). Observing tissue
matrices which have not gelled is a valid result to be discussed in the
results section below.

7\. Add     ~180-200ml media to entire 15mL dish, ensure entire mould is
covered.  15:10 - 16:10  

8. Culture at 37°C overnight before checking.

workflow.

  




# Tips and Tricks for this protocol:

  * When pelleting cells, make sure they are completely dry
  * Flick pellet to dislodge before adding medium
  * Add Medium first to pellet to prevent clumping and cell death
  * Col1 is very viscous, pipette carefully - when adding 10x DMEM, it turns yellow
  * As soon as you add the NaOH, be quick as the Col starts to gel
  * Everything has to be exact, don't be tempted to add more cells than the volume stated if there are some left
  * Add cells slowly!


Results / Observations


Bioprocess/ Technical Observations:

  * Completion of this experiment went smoothly without any set backs. 
  * Coating
    * Bleach affects PDMS integrity (peels off the surface of the petri dish). 
    * No leakage of gel matrix observed. 
  * Pellet:
    * Pellet in the 500mL centrifuge tube was quite soft but did not dislodge when aspirating supernatant. 
    * All Pellets measured at the 5mL mark (in the 50mL Falcon tube) at the second centrifugation step (step 6). 
  * Future notes for overall improvement:
    * Coat plates a day before
    * Leave to dry (after from EtOH soaking) in the BSC overnight
    * Make up reagents 1-2 weeks ahead of time. 
    * Centrifugation of cells can be initiated during the Pluronic-188 coating time frame. 
    * Less things in the BSC the better 
    * Avoid doing too many conditions at once (unless there is enough assistance to do this) as this leads to cultures remaining in a stressful environment longer than necessary. 
    * Add growth medium VERY VERY slowly (water fall/ droplets at zero speed on the pipette guns) with the tip of the pipette pointing at the wall of the disc scaffold. 

Gelation Observations:

  * All cultures appeared to turning from opaque magenta to yellow within 15 minutes post seeding. 
  * All cultures gelled (to varing degrees). 

  * Condition 1 (Control): 
    * Weak gel formation but observed to be stiffer than the 'thickness' of the gel at the time of seeding. 
    * When petri dish was gently moved the gel matrix is observed to no longer 'adhere' to the walls of the disc scaffold. 
    *   

  * Condition 2 (Control gel matrix set at Ambient conditions): 
    * Weakest gel formation but 'stiffer' (loosely used terminology) than the gel matrix at the time of seeding
    *   

  * Condition 3: (Gel Matrix containing HEPES in cell+growth media suspension): 
    * Some what stiff gelation that lacks integrity. 
    * When petri dish was gently moved the gel matrix is observed to no longer 'adhere' to the walls of the disc scaffold.
    * Slightly granular appearing matrix and transparent 
    * Addition of growth media after ~3 hours led to operator accidentally inserting a pipette into the centre of the tissue disc which may affect adequate tissue formation. 
    *   

  * Condition 4: (Gel Matrix containing 0.2M NaOH solution): 2 hours and 30 minutes
    * Some what stiff gelation that lacks integrity. 
    * When petri dish was gently moved the gel matrix is observed to no longer 'adhere' to the walls of the disc scaffold.

Questions:

  * How many tissue discs (maximum) can be done in one experiment to try the most conditions
  * There are no replicates in this experiment.
  * Can we order a deeper tissue culture container (that is autoclave able)? Growth medium spillage is highly probelmatic for sterility and ease of handling
