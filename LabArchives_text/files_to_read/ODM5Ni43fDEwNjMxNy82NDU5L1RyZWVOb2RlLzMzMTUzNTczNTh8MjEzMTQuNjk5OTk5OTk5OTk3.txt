  1. Prepare one ultra low attachment T75 flask containing 49 ml SCGM. Equilibrate flask for at least 3h in an incubator at 37°C 5% CO2, 95% relative humidity.  We did not have any low attachment T75s so instead we equilibrated the media in a normal T175, placed in incubator at 1pm  

  2. After equilibration transfer 7ml of medium from the T75 flask into a 50ml centrifuge tube just before thawing the cells. 
  3. Quickly thaw one vial quail cells in the 37°C water bath. Do not immerse the vial completely, only about 2/3, to keep the top of the vial out of the water. Take care to remove the vial from the water bath immediately when the cells are just thawed. Ideally, a small ice clump (approximately 5 mm) is still visible. 17:00
  4. Dry wipe the tube. Wet a wipe with 70% ethanol, wipe the tube and transfer it to the biosafety cabinet.
  5. Tap vial gently to detach the cell pellet, and transfer cells to an empty 50 ml centrifuge tube. Note: Do not mix the cells in the vial by pipetting. 
  6. Dropwise add 1 ml equilibrated medium (from the 7 ml) to the cells and swirl the tube gently for 10 seconds.
  7. Incubate cells for one minute. 
  8. Repeat the last step with 2 ml medium and then with 4 ml medium. 
  9. Homogenise the cell suspension by inverting the tube several times and sample 100 µl for cell count.
  10. Perform cell count, and record here https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1DPzKubYxfHmWogVPihC-SSIBtIylyrBQE5kRX5Z8NtI/edit#gid=0  
Cell number: Live: 1,736,000  
Dead: 1,036,000.  
Note that we do not believe the total cell count to be accurate as the vial
should have contained approx 7.5M cells. When we looked at cell suspension
after seeding, it appeared quite dense, so it is unlikely that the actual cell
number was as low as the count indicated. We were unable to recount,as we had
allready proceeded to seeding.  

  11. Added 43mL media and transfered cells into 8 x wells of Ultra Low attachment 6 well plates  
  12. Incubate flask at 37°C, 5% CO2, 95% relative humidity. Incubator 78, library lab 17:15
