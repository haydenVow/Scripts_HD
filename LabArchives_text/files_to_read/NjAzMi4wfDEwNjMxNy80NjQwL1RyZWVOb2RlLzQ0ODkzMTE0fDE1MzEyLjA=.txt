Process:

Make 2xaliquots for each of the media below with volumes as indicated (16
aliquots altogether). Add 100ng/mL of FGF, IGF1, and ~~PDGF~~ to each of the
aliquots by using stock reagents as shown in the table above. This media will
be used for feeds today and on Monday 18th. Stored media aliquots in the
fridge (4 degrees C)

  

1\. RPMI + 5% FBS (Mix ID: 7399): 15.5 mL and 5.5 mL  
2\. RPMI + 20% KSR (Mix ID: 7400): 15.5 mL and 10.5 mL  

3\. CD-CHO + 5% FBS (Mix ID: 7064): 15:5 mL and 5.5 mL  

4\. CD-CHO + 20% KSR (Mix ID: 7065): 15.5 mL and 10.5 mL  

  

Reagent IDs of stock:

FGFb: m5077

IGF1-LR3:  m3644

 ~~PDGF-BB: m6805~~

PDGF was not added to media because we ran out of this reagent.




Observations/Summary:

Added growth factors to aliquots of each of these media:

1\. RPMI + 5% FBS (Mix ID: 6780)  
2\. RPMI + 20% KSR (Mix ID: 6781)

3\. CD-CHO + 5% FBS (Mix ID: 7064)

4\. CD-CHO + 20% KSR (Mix ID: 7065)

  

PDGF was not added because we are waiting for more stock.
