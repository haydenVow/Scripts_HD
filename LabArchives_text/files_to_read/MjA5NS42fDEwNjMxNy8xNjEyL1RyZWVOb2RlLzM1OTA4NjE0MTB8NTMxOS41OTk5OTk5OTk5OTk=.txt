Growth Media:

  * [x]  DMEM/F12 + 20% FBS + 1X P/S + P38i (10uM)

Total media required: 45 + 15mL

Total p38i required: 30uL (already added 4-June-2021)

  




Process:

1\. Removed tubes from the fridge (see location above) and Placed in water
bath at 37 degrees for 15 minutes    10:17 am

2\. Stopped the shakers in the top and bottom sanyo incubaotrs using
pause/stop button located on the pads stuck to the left side of the incubators
(the button to pause and start the shaker looks like a triangle and a square
separated by a backlash.

3\. Place all vessels in the BSC and wait 2 minutes for the microcarriers to
settle to base of each vessel.

4\. Removed  50  % of supernatant from each vessel (15mL from E125s, 5mL from
50mL shake tubes).

3\. Replaced with fresh growth media (same volume as removed above for each
vessel).

4\. Returned vessel to incubate shaking at: 11:24am

  * [x]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (aviary cells)

\- Top sanyo incubator for E125 flasks shaking at 120 rpm, ensure the shaker
is turned on.

- Bottom sanyo incubator for 50mL shake tubes shaking at 250 rpm, ensure the shaker is turned on.
