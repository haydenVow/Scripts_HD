Growth Media:

  * [x]  DMEM/F12 + 20% FBS + 1X P/S + P38i (10uM

  




### Process:

1\. Took image of vessel with microscope on phase setting.

2\. Gelatin coated    2      x     T175     vessel with sterile filtered 0.1%
gelatin solution and then incubated all coated flasks at 37˚C.

  1. Time when all vessels(s) placed into the incubator       12:00   a/pm 

3\. Aliquotted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then
placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath for a minimum of 20 minutes
prior to use:

  1. TrypLE:     15    mL in     1x50mL    tubes
  2.  dPBS (for washing and neutralising):     25    mL in    1x50    tubes
  3. Growth media (for seeding):     2x30    mL in     2x50mL    tubes

Time that all aliquots were placed in the water bath the warm before use
12:15   a/pm

Note: if aliquots were placed in water bath at different time, record the time
stamp for each individual solution.




4\. Removed vessel(s) 7117 and 7118 from the incubator     12:20   a/pm

5\. Washed the vessel(s) with dPBS (warmed).

6\. Added     6    mL tryple to each vessel/well and incubated at 37˚C.

  1. Start/Finish for TrypLE was     12:40-12:55   a/pm 

7\. Neutralised with     6     dPBS and collected cell suspensions in separate
15mL    tubes.

8\. Centrifuged at 650 x g for 5 min.

  1. Start/Finish time for centrifugation was     13:00-13:05   a/pm 




9\. Aspirated the supernatant(s).

10\. Resuspended pellet(s) in     1    mL     growth     media     13:20
a/pm

13\. Transferred each cell suspension to separate pre-warmed growth media
aliquots of    30     mL.

14\. Transferred cell suspension into one pre-gelatin coated       T175
vessel each.  

15\. Left at RT in the BSC for 30 min to allow cells to settle      13:22  -
13:52 a/pm  

16\. Transferred vessel(s) to incubate at:

  * [x]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (avian cells)

Observations/Summary:

  * Clone = 21L10 appears to be growing faster than clone 25K6 after inspection. Clone 27B2 hasn't appeared to have grown much at all (confluence still <10% in the T25 flask) 
  * 6 well plate was discarded.
