Process:

  1. Please observe the 2x 75s under the microscope to check for any interesting/ abnormal findings.    :
  2. Place the already aliquoted media into the water bath (30ºC, for reptilian cells)   10:56
  3. Removed  50 % of supernatant (6 mL) from each vessel. 
    * Note: please use separate serologicals when aspirating supernatant for each flask as they are different types of CHOMP cells
  4. Replaced with  6 mL per vessel of  growth medium. 
    * Note: please use separate serologicals when transfering the medium into each flask as they are different types of CHOMP cells)
  5. Returned vessel to incubate at:   :

  * [ ]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (avian cells)
  * [x]  30ºC, 5% CO2 (reptilian cells)
