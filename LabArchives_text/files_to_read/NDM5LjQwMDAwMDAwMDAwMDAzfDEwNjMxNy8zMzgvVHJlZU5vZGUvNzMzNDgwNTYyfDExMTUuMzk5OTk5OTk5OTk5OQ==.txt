RELATED TO MILESTONE: 2021 Q2 Cell Availability Milestone 2: Isolate and
expand at least two MuSC clones, which have been pre-screened for microcarrier
culture and are capable of differentiation, to WCB2 using microcarrier culture

AIM/PURPOSE: To create a post-cloning working cell bank (WCB2) of DAISY4_16G9
that has been grown in microcarrier culture.

HYPOTHESIS: That not all cells adapted to planar cultureware will survive in
microcarrier culture and that, therefore, only cells that survive microcarrier
culture should be used in WCB vials.

RESULTS SUMMARY: This should only be completed if the data can be visualised
with a single graph/image, otherwise simply state "See Report".

CONCLUSIONS: What were the overall findings? This should be a concise summary
and not duplicate the information in the results/report. For example "We found
that Bovine MuSCs could only achieve a cell density 50% of that observed with
planar culture without undergoing precocious differentiation. These results
mean that we are currently limited to X cells/ml in suspension culture until
we find a way to inhibit precocious differentiation"

NEXT STEPS: This should be a dot point list of any immediate outcomes, changes
to SOPs, as well as providing a direct link to any new experiments arising
from these findings. Importantly, this section should also include any
potential DEPLOYMENTS to the production team
