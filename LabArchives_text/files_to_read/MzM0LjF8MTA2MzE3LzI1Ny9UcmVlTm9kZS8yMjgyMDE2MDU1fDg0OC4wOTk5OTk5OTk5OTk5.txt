Process:

1\. Collected  105 mL   of  Growth Media in 1 x 120 mL sterile pot labelled
"LL SUN" from the "media and gelatin" fridge. Placed in water bath   14:50  

2\. Retrieved 7 x T175s from Thermo incubator

3\. Removed  50 % of supernatant from each T175 (15 mL)

4\. Replaced with  15 mL per T175 of  Growth  media.

5\. Returned vessel to incubate at: 15:52
