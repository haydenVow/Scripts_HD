Took samples

  1. Unscrewed the "BENCHMARK" sample tube cover.
  2. Sprayed down the tube end with 70% ethanol.
  3. Connecedt a 5 mL sterile syringe.
  4. Withdrew slightly more than 3 mL (to purge the line).
  5. Discarded the 5 mL syringe.
  6. Connected a fresh sterile syringe and withdrew 3.5 - 4.0 mL of sample.
  7. Disconnected sample syringe and transferred 1 mL of sample each to 3 x 1.5 mL Eppendorf tubes for subsequent analysis.
  8. Sprayed sample tube end and cap with 70% ethanol, re-attached cap.
  9. Prepared sample for biochemistry analysis
    1. Took 300 uL, centrifuged at 500 RCF for 5 minutes
    2. Transferred 250 uL of supernatant to 250 uL of ultrapure lab water
    3. Labelled tube "Biostat TT 01-Aug-2022"
    4. Transferred to green tube rack for EPIC32419 in freezer 71 Albert 6582
  10. Replaced old base bottle with a fresh one
    1. Added 200 mL of ultrapure water to a clean 250 mL Schott bottle
    2. Added 8 g of sodium hydroxide pellets to the water
    3. Capped the bottle and sterilized by autoclaving
    4. Once the bottle was sterilized, transferred it into the BSC
    5. Turned off the base pump, clamped the line and removed it from the base pump
    6. Transferred the old bottle (still attached to bioreactor) into the BSC
    7. Swapped over the lids from the old and new bottles
    8. Reinstalled the base line in the base pump
    9. Turned the pump to manual to prime the line
    10. Turned the pump to automatic to continue automatic dosing to control pH

Notes

  

Online:

  * Temp: 37degC
  * dO: 49.2 %
  * pH: 7.40
  * Stir: 237-238 RPM

Offline:

  * pH: 7.5
  * cell count manual: 452,000 viable cells/mL, 90.4% viability
  * cell count ViCell: 378,000 viable cells/mL, 93.5% viability

Base bottler: M13291

See cell counting spreadsheet for count calculations  
  
  
  




### Observations/Summary:

  * ### Base bottle was empty - replaced with a fresh bottle of 1 M NaOH

  * ### Cell count roughly double since Friday - doubling time of only 3 days - likely cells will be ready for harvest on Thursday 4th August
