Observations

Interestingly, cell numbers have not yet began to decline and cells have a
healthy morphology. In cultures containing either YIGSR or RGD (not in
cultures containing both), cell numbers have actually increased, which is not
something we have seen at all within the first week of suspension adaption at
Vow.

Process:  

  1. Place media in water bath >15min prior to use
  2. Collected vessels from shaker, wiped with ethanol-sprayed Rediwipe, and brought into BSC 
  3. Centrifuged 50 mL tubes at 400 x g for 5 mins 
  4. Aspirated  80% (8mL) of supernatant, taking extra care to not disrupt or aspirate pellet.
  5. Resuspended each pellet in the remaining 5mL of media, and took 2x 10ul samples from each culture for hemocytometer counts 
  6. Performed  hemocytometer counts (see below for counts).
  7. Topped up each 50 mL centrifuge tube with 15 mL of fresh pre-warmed media.
  8. Pipette-mixed cultures.
  9. Returned to incubator
