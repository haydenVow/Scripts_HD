Calculations

For suspension cultures: 250 uL hoechst 1mg/mL + 750 uL MilliQ - add 20 uL in
200 uL

Need at least 20 uL with multi-channel pipette - so have to half conc and
double volume

For adherent clones: 384WP have 80 -100 uL - add 20 uL/well. 20 x 384 x 4 =
30720 + error = 40 mL  = 0.5 mL Hoechst 10 mg/mL + 39.5 mL MilliQ

Process

  1. Make up Hoechst solution:
    1. 0.5 mL hoechst (10 mg/mL) + 39.5 mL MilliQ (250 ug/mL)   

    2. Sterile filter using syringe filter
  2. Add 20 uL per well to each corner well of 1 x 384-well plate (total 100 uL - 25 ug/mL hoechst)  

  3. Allow to incubate at RT in the dark for 20 minutes 7:35 - 7:55  

  4. Check on Zaber microscope if cells are fluorescing on DAPI channel   

  5. If the cells are fluorescing, repeat steps 2 and 3 with all wells of 4 x 384-well plates 
  6. If cells are not fluorescing, double Hoechst concentration and repeat test with corner wells of second 384-well plate  

    * Cells did not fluoresce, so trialled 50 ug/mL by adding 500 uL hoechst to the working solution and re-filtering. Trialled higher conc. on 2 wells. Checked cells at 9:45, cells were fluorescing on DAPI channel in all concentrations trialled, however 50 ug/mL concentration had a lot of fluorescing debris. Therefore will add 10uL per well of hoechst to wells to get a final conc of 25 ug/mL to try to avoid debris.   

  7. Stain timestamp: Plates 1&2 10:00, Plates 3&4 10:15  
  




100 % feed with 5 ug/mL hoechst in medium - added plate 1 - 12:20-13:12, plate
4 - 12:48-13:50




100% feed with growth medium (no hoechst) 15:35




Observations

Trialled 25 ug/mL and 50 ug/mL in corner wells - saw debris form in 50 ug/mL
wells but not in 25 ug/mL wells

Test cells only stained positive after 2H of hoechst incubation
