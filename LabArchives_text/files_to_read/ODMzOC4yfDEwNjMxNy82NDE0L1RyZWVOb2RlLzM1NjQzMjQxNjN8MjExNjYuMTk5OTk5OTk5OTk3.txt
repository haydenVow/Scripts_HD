Growth MediaM10121; 250 ml  
  
  




Process:

1\. Aliquotted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then
placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath for a minimum of 20 minutes
prior to use:

  1.  Growth media (for seeding):   240 mL in  2 x 120 ml  tubes 
  2.  Time that all aliquot was placed in the water bath to warm before use:   15:30 pm 

2\. Collected the cryovial from Liquid Nitrogen storage & place in foam
floater in water bath for 5 min  15:51 - 15:58 pm

Location where cryovial was collected from:

 Homer  OR Dewer 1: Brew

Tower/Bucket # 2

Box/Cane # 6

Vial location: G2

Vial ID(s): 12427

Vial location: G1

Vial ID(s): 12426

  

THE BOX IN TOWER 2 ACTUALLY SAID TOWER 1 ON IT, SO IT WAS CONFUSING TO FIND
THESE VIALS




3\. Ethanol sprayed & transferred the vial(s) to the BSC.

4\. Added  1 ml of Growth Media (to generate a total volume of 1mL in the
cryovial) to the cryovial, resuspended the cell suspension gently to reduce
osmotic shock.

5\. Collected the entire 1mL of cell suspension & transfer into the pre-warmed
tube of Growth Media (prepared in Step 2).




6\. Using a 10mL serological pipette, resuspended & distributed 1 x vial
evenly in each of the  120 ml of pre-warmed Growth Media (prepared in Step 2
and each used to seed 4 x T175)

7\. Seeded cells into (non-gelatin coated) flasks/wells at approximately 15k
cells per cm2.

8\. Transfered   30 mL to each T175   flask/well.

9\. Transfered flask/plate(s) to incubate at: 16:20 pm

  * [ ]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (aviary cells)
  * [ X] 30ºC, 5% CO2 (reptilian cells)
