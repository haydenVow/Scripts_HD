# Procedure - Feed

# Note: Fibroblasts do NOT require Gelatin coated Flasks, and do NOT require
p38i.  

  1. Turn on the water bath and set to 37'C.
  2. Aliquot required growth media into a sterile container/s and place into the water bath. 
  3. Place in the water bath and heat for at least 20 minutes.
  4. Observe the cell flasks for confluence under the microscope using 4 x magnification and take images as required. 
  5. Transfer flasks to the BSC and remove required volume of media from each flask (according to the Table below).
  6. Replace the same volume into each flask with the prepared growth media.
  7. Return the flasks to the incubators

  
* Roller Bottles (R850) require 200mL for a 100% change and 100mL for a 50% change

All roller bottles had an increase in the number of small aggregates - many of
which were still attached to the flask close to the top rim of the bottle. All
bottles also had cells attached, but at about a 50-70% confluence. For the 2
bottles that did not receive a 100% media change (bottles 4 & 5) there were
still floating dead cells, but also the same 50-70% confluence for cell
adherence.
