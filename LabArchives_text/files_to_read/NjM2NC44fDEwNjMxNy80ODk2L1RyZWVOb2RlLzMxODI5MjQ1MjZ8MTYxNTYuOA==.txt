1\. Prepared    mL  PBST (0.2% Triton-X)

2\. Prepared    mL  blocking buffer: PBST (0.1% Triton-X + PBS) + 3% bovine
serum albumin (BSA). (Kept in the fridge until needed in blocking step)

3\. Prepared Primary Antibody Mix: :  20 µL   Primary #1 MyoG (Santa Cruz)
(1:200  ) +  80 µL   Primary #2 MF20 (DSHB)   (1:50  ) +  3.9  mL Blocking
Buffer

Pipette-mixed antibody mix and stored refrigerated away from light until
needed.

Sample selection:

  1. Image/photograph main sample plate to record muscle ring migration and gel contraction (if any). Also image meatballs inside and outside of the buckets
  2. From each condition, slice sample in half using sterile tweezers/scalpel.
  3. Transfer half of each sample into a new plate with 0.1% cold PFA and fix using below protocol
    1. Fixing protocol ( ~ 1.20 - 2.30 hr)
      1.  Prepare 
        1. 0.1% PFA - 0.6mL of 4%PFA in 24mL of PBS  

        2. 50 mL of ice cold PBS
      2. Removed media from each well and wash with 1000 ul PBS.
        1. timestamps 14:10 - 14:15
      3.  Added  1000 uL µL PFA for 1 - 2 hours  in the fridge (1 hr for small loops, 2 hrs if the loop is >5mm in diameter) :  
        1. Small pieces:  14:30 - 15:30 pm
      4. Removed PFA (and add in PFA waste container) and wash wells 3 times with   500 µL of ice cold PBS
      5. Add 0.5 mL PBS into each well
      6. Parafilm plate and place in the fridge.
    2. For other half, transfer samples into an Eppendorf tube with PBS and hand to Shaleen for BCA/Bradford




Process:

  

Permeabilise ( ~ 20 - 30 min)

1\. Removed PBS from each well.

2\. Added   µL PBST (0.2% Triton-X) to each well for 15 min:  : - : pm

3\. Aspirated PBST for each well.




Blocking ( ~ 1 hr)

1\. Added  100 µL of blocking buffer (3% BSA in PBST [0.1% Triton-X]) and
incubate for 45 minutes - 1hr at RT. (no more than 1 hour):   : - : a/pm




Single/Simultaneous Primary Antibody staining ( ~ 10 minutes or 2hr)

1\. Removed blocking buffer from each well.

2\. Incubated cells with primary antibody for 90min - 2hrs at RT, or 4ºC
overnight:   : - : a/pm

3\. Parafilmed plates and stored at 4ºC in tissue culture lab Fridge.

After this step, all further task should be performed in a dark room. The
vessel should also be wrapped foil when not used.
