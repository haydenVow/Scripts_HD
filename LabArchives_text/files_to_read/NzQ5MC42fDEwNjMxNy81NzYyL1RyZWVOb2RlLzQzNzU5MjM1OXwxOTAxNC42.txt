Process:

  1. Please observe the 2x 75s under the microscope to check for any interesting/ abnormal findings. 
  2. Place the already aliquoted media into the water bath (30ºC, for reptilian cells)  :
  3. Removed  50 % of supernatant (6 mL) from each vessel. 
    * Note: please use separate serologicals when aspirating supernatant for each flask as they are different types of CHOMP cells
  4. Replaced with  6 mL per vessel of  growth medium. 
    * Note: please use separate serologicals when transfering the medium into each flask as they are different types of CHOMP cells)
  5. Returned vessel to incubate at:  16:28

  * [ ]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (avian cells)
  * [x]  30ºC, 5% CO2 (reptilian cells)

### Observations/Summary:

50% feed 1x T75 flasks of CHOMP09. this culture will be continued to be
continually monitored and maintained.  
  
Observation of the CHOMP07 flask reveals an empty flask. There are no live
cells, nor debris to indicate cell death. This may be due to a mistake we made
during the passage where the cell suspension was not added to the new flask
with fresh media, following the cell count. The CHOMP07 'culture' will remain
in the incubator till 07-December-2021 to ensure the is no cell growth
occurring in this flask, and then imaged and discarded if we can confirm there
are no cells in the flask.
