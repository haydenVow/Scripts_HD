Important info:

  * The media for this feed is in a foil sealed 96 well plastic block
  * Each well is a completely different media condition - please change tips for every aspirate and dispense!
  * A1 of media block corresponds to A1 of plate and so on and so forth - please make sure the plates and media blocks are the right way up before you start the feed to ensure the right wells get the right media

Process:

  1. Remove DSD media blocks (main block and control block) from the fridge and placed in the incubator for 60 mins or float in waterbath for 30 min 12:22 am/pm
  2. Briefly centrifuged DSD media blocks (20 sec)
  3. Checked plates under Primo to ensure cells are healthy and alive. Please note in "Observations" the condition of the cells . 
  4. Removed  100  % of supernatant from vessel. Ensure some liquid is leftover in the well so the cells don`t dry out! Immediately add the fresh respective DSD media
  5. Replaced with  140uL  (per well/per vessel) of DSD  media. Each well is a different condition. Make sure to change tips for every aspirate and dispense with your multichannel.
  6. Foil sealed media block (foil seals located on the shelf above the Primo)  \- and placed back in Biomaterials fridge for future feeds. Alternatively, you can seal the plates with sterile rubber mats and parafilm.
  7. Returned vessel to incubate at:  14:19 am/pm 
    * [X]  37ÂºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
    * Incubator (#  ), Lab [Main]




### Observations/Summary:

observed ~10 random wells under scope-- all looked viable and confluent but no
obvious differentiation seen

100  % media changed on vessel(s)

Well H12 had no media to aspirate nor additional media in the DSD media
storage plate
