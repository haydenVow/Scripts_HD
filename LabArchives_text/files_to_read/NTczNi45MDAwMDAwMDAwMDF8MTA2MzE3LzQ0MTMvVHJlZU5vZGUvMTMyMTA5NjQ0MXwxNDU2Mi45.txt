Process:

  1. Aliquoted 23 mL of growth medium in 1 x 50 mL tube
  2. Added growth factors to aliquot as listed in table above (see Mix IDs for growth factors in table above to ensure you are adding the correct ones).
    *  Placed aliquot in water bath 13:23
  3. Collected E125 from shaker, wiped with ethanol-sprayed Rediwipe, and brought into BSC 14:09
  4. Pipette suspension into 1 x 50 mL tubes. Kept E125 vessels in BSC, as culture will be returned to this vessel after feed. 
  5. Centrifuged at 300 x g for 5 min. 14:12 - 14:17  

  6. Aspirated  100% (30 mL) of supernatant, taking extra care to not disrupt or aspirate pellet. NOTE: 7 mL of supernatant goes back into E125, 23 mL can be discarded into waste. This is so we can do a 75% feed but still get an accurate cell count.
  7. Resuspended pellet in 500 uL of medium
  8. Took 1 x 10 uL sample for haemocytometer cell count.  
Cell count: 1,820,000

  9. Recorded count here https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-Z9HKM0xSq8-UX2C4876emMP7FCWLcpSqxwLkI-zypg/edit#gid=0
  10. Added  23 mL of fresh, warmed growth media to 50 mL tube
  11. Gently pipette-mixed cultures using serelogical, before moving cell suspension back to E125
  12. Returned E125 to incubator.   14:28

### Observations/Summary:

 100  % media changed on vessel(s)

  1. 7694-F_DOLLY12-Sheep P11-1of1  
  

Total count was performed during the haemocytometer check instead of
distinguishing between live/dead, with debris excluded. This may have resulted
in an overestimated count, as compared to previous counts over the past week.
