Process:

  1. Weighed out 1g of P188. Added 50mL of E89C media (no lipids) to this to create a 2% w/v solution. Warmed container in incubator on shaker.
  2. Weighed out 2.2g of P188. Added this to 220 mL of E89C media (no lipids) to create a 1% w/v solution. Warmed container in incubator on shaker.
  3. syringe filtered the 2% w/v solution. Then added 500uL of lipids.
    1. Aliquoted 2x 16 mL of media from this solution.
    2. Added 8 uL of 100mM glyoxylic acid to make E810C (contains 50uM glyoxylic acid).
    3. Added 0.4 uL of 10 ug/mL IL-6 to make E811B (contained 250pg/mL of IL-6).
  4. Sterile filtered the 1% w/v solution. Then added 2.2 mL of lipids.
