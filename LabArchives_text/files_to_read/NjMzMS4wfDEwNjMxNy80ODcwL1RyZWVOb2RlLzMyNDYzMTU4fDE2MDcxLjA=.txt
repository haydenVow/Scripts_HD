Perform feed using below volumes:

  




Growth Media:

  * [ ]  DMEM + 10% HS + 1X P/S
  * [ ]  DMEM + 10% HS + 1X P/S + 25ng/mL FGF-basic + P38i (10uM)
  * [ ]  DMEM + 10% HS + 1X P/S + 25ng/mL FGF-basic
  * [ ]  DMEM + 10% HS + 1X P/S + P38i (10uM)
  * [ ]  DMEM + 10% FBS + 1X P/S
  * [ ]  DMEM + 20% FBS + 1X P/S
  * [ ]  DMEM/F12 + 10% FBS + 1X P/S
  * [ ]  DMEM/F12 + 20% FBS + 1X P/S
  * [ ]  DMEM/F12 + 20% FBS + 1X P/S + 25ng/mL FGF-basic
  * [ ]  DMEM/F12 + 20% FBS + 1X P/S + P38i (10uM)

Check flask to see if confluent or not. If it is confluent change to 100% E6,
otherwise feed with 50% GM.

Reagent preparation

1\. Aliquotted  150 mL   of  Growth Media. Placed in water bath   13:15 a/pm




Cell factory Process

  1. Unscrew white cap and remove blue cap and place aside.
  2. Removed   50%   of supernatant Cell Factory by carefully pouring into a waste container with volume marking.
  3. Replaced with   mL   (per flask) of growth media by carefully pouring media through the white cap opening 
  4. Place caps back and equalise 4CF by placing it on its side (blue cap on the bottom and white cap on the top, see image below:)  
  

4\. Returned vessel to incubate at: 13:42

  * [x]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (aviary cells)

  

  * [x]  Thermo Incubator (ID #13)
  * [ ]  Top Sanyo Incubator (ID #25)
  * [ ]  Bottom Sanyo Incubator
  * [ ]  Top Binder Incubator
  * [ ]  Bottom Binder Incubator




### Observations/Summary:

 50 % media changed on vessel(s)

  1. 8824-DOLLY12-Sheep P7-1of1 still not confluent enough for diff
