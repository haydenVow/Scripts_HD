Aim/Purpose


To assess a scaffold fabrication approach that maximises surface area and
allows media diffusion throughout the scaffold.


Hypothesis


Agarose 3% will be a viable material to produce a mould that maximises surface
area and allows media diffusion.

  


Technical Gap


n/a


Method/Procedure


## 1) Heat Agarose 3% solution and place into syringe

## 2) Fill cylinder mould with 3% Agarose for casting

## 3) Remove mould. Place rubber on either side of the mould to prevent the
blade cutting through the whole mould. Create vertical and horizontal cuts
using a box cutter knife.

## 4) Place in water

## 5) Results

Mould held well in water overnight. Satisfies need to maximise surface area
and allow media to diffuse throughout mould.

Fabrication technique needs to be improved to scale.
