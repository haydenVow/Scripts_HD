## 1\. Background

The p38 MAPK pathway is critical for muscle stem cell differentiation. To
reduce precocious differentiation in proliferating muscle stem cell
populations we often add an inhibitor of this pathway to our media to increase
the proportion of proliferating cells.

## 3\. Safety

The preparation of P38i aliquots is to be performed in a Biological Safety
Cabinet. General lab PPE is required, including face mask, hair net, gloves,
and lab coat. Take care to not spill DMSO on any exposed skin, as it is a very
powerful solvent.

## 5\. Consumables/Reagents Required

  1. DMSO (dimethyl sulfoxide)
  2. P38i stock powder
  3. 2 x Falcon tubes
  4. 1 x Syringe filter unit
  5. Sterile microtubes 




## 8\. Method/Procedure (suitable for Selleck Chemicals SB203580)

Note: Please perform this procedure with the BSC light turned off. Growth
factors are often sensitive to light exposure.  

  1. Calculate the volume of DMSO required to create a 2000x stock solution (20 mM) of 7.54 mg/mL (Use the calculator spreadsheet to determine the volumetric requirements and number of aliquots produced).
  2. Using a serological pipette, transfer the required amount of DMSO into a sterile falcon tube in the Biological Safety Cabinet (BSC).  
  3. Retrieve stock powder from storage location (p38i stock is kept at -20 degrees C).
  4. Using a microfuge, centrifuge the vial containing P38i powder for 30 seconds and then transfer the vial to the BSC.
  5. Using a micropipette, transfer DMSO from the falcon tube to the stock vial to reconstitute the powder to a concentration of 1.0 mg/mL. Pipette mix thoroughly and smoothly to dissolve the stock powder, taking care not to spill any of the solution. 
  6. Transfer the entire aliquot back to the falcon tube of DMSO. Repeat steps 5 - 6 twice more to ensure that the entire amount of powder is dissolved in the DMSO. 
  7. Check the vial to ensure that no powder is left. If any powder remains, repeat steps 5 - 6 until the vial is clean.
  8. Using a serological pipette, carefully mix the solution to ensure a homogenous mix (do not vortex!). 
  9. Pour or pipette solution into a syringe filter unit and filter into a new sterile falcon tube.
  10. Transfer the solution into sterile microtubes. Remember to add at least 5 uL to your desired aliquot volume to account for loss of liquid from pipetting. 
  11. Enter details in Stockyard V2 under "Create Mix".
  12. Place aliquots into an appropriately sized container (e.g. cryobox, 500 mL sterile pot) and stick Stockyard label on the container. Add a note of the volume per aliquot for future users. 
  13. Store in - 20 degrees C freezer.
