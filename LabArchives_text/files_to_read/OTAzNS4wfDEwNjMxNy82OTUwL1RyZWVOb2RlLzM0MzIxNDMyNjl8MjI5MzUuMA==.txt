Process:  
100% media changes to be performed every 2 days

  1. Aliquotted  6 mL of  DK-I media and 6 mL E6 
  2. Placed in water bath  at 37C  
  3. Removed   100 % of supernatant (500 uL) from vessel
  4. Replaced with   500 uL mL (per well/per vessel) of  differentiation  media. 
  5. Imaged plates at 10x using phase microscopy
  6. Returned vessel to incubate at: 

  * [ X]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (aviary cells)

  

  * Incubator (119 ), Lab [Main/Library/Production]
