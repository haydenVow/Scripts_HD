Background:

Vow are a cultured meat company here in Sydney.  They are creating meat using
animal cells, rather than entire animals, and we are interested in advancing
our research with the help of some proteomics. Specifically a list of relative
quantities (such as Max Quant's intensity-based absolute quantification iBAQ
or exponentially modified protein abundance index (emPAI).

The first sample will be 1g of a frozen, single-cell population derived from
sheep for label-free proteomics.  The aim is the proportionate abundance of
different proteins.

25/8/21

PPMS order placed for: 1g of a frozen, single-cell population derived from
sheep for label-free proteomics that will be sent frozen (-20C). We're looking
to show relative protein abundance based on ion intensity, and we can generate
rough g/g amounts using BCA data provided by the core. Our aim is to determine
the relative abundance of the different proteins within the sample (ideally
having a table of proteins in order of abundance) with an indication of the
proportion of the relative proteins in the sample.




27/08/2021

Sample arrived at CPC by uber courier. was placed in the -30 C freezer in
contract box.




1/9/2021

Thawed sample, added 600uL U/TU and tipprobe sonicated (2 x 20s @70%
continuous power)

Acetone precipitation (1mL ice cold acetone , -30 deg C O/N) was applied to
the sample

2/9/2021

Sample was divided into 3 and centrifuged at 16g for 10min, discarded
supernatant and air dried pellet (browish pellet)

Added 200uL to one sample and stored the other 2 (-30deg freezer, contract
samples box).

Had a lot of trouble resolubilising, tried sonic bath, tip probe and added an
extra 800uL U/TU.

Took out 2uL for QUBIT quant (5.9mg/mL)

Reduced with 10mM DTT for 30 min at room temperature

Alkylated with 25mM IAA for30 min at room temperature in the dark

Quenched with DDT to a final concentration of 20mM

Took out 20 uL (~120ug)

Diluted with AmBiC 1 in 5 (final vol = 100uL)

Digested with 2.4ug of trypsin overnight at 37 degrees in Thermomixer

  

  




3/9/2021

Sample removed from Thermomixer and placed into fridge

6/9/2021

TFA was added to a final concentration of 1%

Sample was centrifuged for 16 000g for 5 mins

Half of the sample (~600 uL) was removed and underwent a HLB syringe clean up

Elution was dried in speed vacuum overnight

7/9/2021

Sample was reconstituted in 30 uL water

Qubit reading of 1.07 mg/mL

3 uL loaded onto the HFX3 - results appear low

Removed sample from vial and dried via speed vacuum for ~1 hour

Reconstituted in 15 uL loading buffer

Qubit reading of 1.50 mg/mL

3 uL loaded onto the HFX3

The number of missed cleavages is higher than expected:

To improve the results the 2 new digests were set up, one after a repeat
acetone precipitation and one after a chloroform-methanol cleanup.
