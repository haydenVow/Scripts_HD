## Performed by: LL  




Reagent preparation:

1\. Prepared   2 mL  PBST (0.2% Triton-X)

2\. Prepared   2 mL  blocking buffer: PBST (0.1% Triton-X + PBS) + 3% bovine
serum albumin (BSA). (Kept in the fridge until needed in blocking step)

3\. Prepared Primary Antibody Mix: :  5 µL   Primary #1 MyoG (Santa Cruz)
(1:200) +  20 µL   Primary #2 MF20 (DSHB) (1:50) +   975 uL  Blocking Buffer

Pipette-mixed antibody mix and stored refrigerated away from light until
needed.

Process:

Fix cells

  1. Aspirated media from wells 
  2. Washed x 2 with 150 uL/well dPBS for 5 min
    1. Timestamp 9:55- 10:00
    2. Timestamp 10:01 - 10:06
  3. Added 100 uL/well PFA and incubated for 15 min. Timestamp: 10:07 - 10:22
  4. Aspirated PFA. Washed x 2 with 150 uL/well dPBS for 5 min.
    1. Timestamp: 10:23 - 10:28
    2. Timestamp: 10:29 - 10:34

Permeabilise

  1. Aspirated dPBS. Added 100 uL/well of PBST and incubated for 15 min. Timestamp: 10:34 - 10:49




Blocking

1\. Added  100 µL of blocking buffer (3% BSA in PBST [0.1% Triton-X]) and
incubate for 45 minutes:  10:51 - 11:36  




Single/Simultaneous Primary Antibody staining

1\. Removed blocking buffer from each well.

2\. Incubated cells with primary antibody for 90min at RT:   11:40 - 13:12  

After this step, all further task should be performed in a dark room. The
vessel should also be wrapped foil when not used.
