Process:

Aliquoted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then
placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath > 30 minutes prior to use

  1. Observed cultures under the microscope and recorded confluence in the table above. 
  2. Imaged cultures on 10x magnification (captured in Mia)
  3. TrypLE:     400 mL 
  4. dPBS (for washing & neutralising)   800 mL
  5. Growth media (for pellet resuspension and seeding):   1200  
  6. Washed the flask(s) with dPBS.
  7. Added  200  mL tryple to each vessel/well and incubated at 37˚C for  10 minutes   
  8. Neutralised with   200  mL dPBS to each vessel (warmed) and combined cell suspension into two  500  mL tubes.
  9. Centrifuged at 500 x g for 5 min.
  10. Aspirated+ discarded supernatant
  11. Resuspended pellet(s) in  100  mL media.  
Performed a cell count using the hemocytometer and recorded the cell count
data in widget or the Google Doc spreadsheet called 'Cell Count Spreadsheet'
(see link below):

  12. Total cell number was:  138,000,000

  13. Re-seeded cells as per table above.

  14. Transferred flasks to incubate at 37ºC, 5% CO2, library lab incubator #78




Cell Count was very high - however cells were suspected to be overly confluent
+ detaching or contaminated (no contamination was observed under a
microscope). Rather than banking/putting into suspension, we decided to
passage into 2 x 4CF at double the usual concentrations to see if "detaching
cells" stuck back down.
