AIM/PURPOSE: To determine the optimal microcarrier candidate for this cell
line, in order to optimise cell mass growth when grown in a adherent carrier
based bioreactor system

HYPOTHESIS: The microcarriers will show similiar proliferation rates across
each carrier, however the harvest efficiency will differ between them.

RESULTS SUMMARY: TBD

CONCLUSIONS: TBD

NEXT STEPS: TBD
