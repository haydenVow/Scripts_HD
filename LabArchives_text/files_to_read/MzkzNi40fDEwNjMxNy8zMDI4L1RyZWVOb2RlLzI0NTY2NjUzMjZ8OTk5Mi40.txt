Requirements


To commission the StimJim stimulator, the signal output waveform must be
validated. The requirements of waveforms from similar tissue stimulation
studies must also be achievable with the chosen system.

Requirements of the stimulator were found in Q2 to be:

  1.  0 - 100 mV/cm and 2 - 10 V/cm experiments.
  2. Biphasic signal. 50 - 100 Hz. Vary intermittent stimulation: every 100 s to 1 hour.


Test 1 - Verify Basic Charge Balanced Biphasic Signal (100 Hz, 0.2 ms pulse, 200 mV)
