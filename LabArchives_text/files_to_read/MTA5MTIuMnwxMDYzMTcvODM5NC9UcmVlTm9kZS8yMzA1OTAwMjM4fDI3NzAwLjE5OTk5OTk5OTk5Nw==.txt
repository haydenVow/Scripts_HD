RELATED TO OKR:  Produce and harvest 1-tonne of meat

AIM/PURPOSE: to pilot test chemical flocculation methods to improve the
efficiency and speed of harvesting cells from large volumes (>10L) of cell
suspension broth

HYPOTHESIS: Addition of flocculants will reduce the number of cells in
supernatant compared to control conditions where no flocculants are added to
the broth

RESULTS SUMMARY:

CONCLUSIONS:
