Process:

Fixing ( ~ 1.20 - 2.30 hr)

  1.  Prepare 0.1% PFA - 0.6mL of 4%PFA in 24mL of PBS  

  2. Removed media from each well and wash with 1000ul PBS.
    1. 10:27 - 10:32
    2. 10:32 - 10:38  

  3.  Added  1000 uL µL PFA for 1 - 2 hours  (1hr for small loops, 2hrs if the loop is >5mm in diameter) :  
    1. Small pieces:  10:43 - 11:43 am
    2. Large pieces: 10:43 - 12:43 pm 
  4. Removed PFA (and add in PFA waste container) and wash wells 3 times with   500 µL of ice cold PBS

Small pieces

1: 11:45 - 11:50

2: 11:50 - 11:55

3:  11:55 - 12:00

Left PBS on: 12:00

Large pieces

1: 12:43 - 12:48

2: 12:48 - 12:53

3:  12:53 - 12:58

  

Cut samples into size and place into a 48wp

  

  

Permeabilise ( ~ 20 - 30 min)

1\. Removed PBS from each well.

2\. Added  500 µL PBST (0.2% Triton-X) to each well for 15 min:  13:20 - 13:35
pm

3\. Aspirated PBST for each well.




Blocking ( ~ 1 hr)

1\. Added  500 µL of blocking buffer (3% BSA in PBST [0.1% Triton-X]) and
incubate for 45 minutes - 1hr at RT. (no more than 1 hour):   13:42 - 14:42 pm




Single/Simultaneous Primary Antibody staining ( ~ 10 minutes or 2hr)

1\. Removed blocking buffer from each well.

2\. Incubated cells with primary antibody for 90min - 2hrs at RT, or 4ºC
overnight:   14:54 pm

3\. Parafilmed plates and stored at 4ºC in tissue culture lab Fridge.

After this step, all further task should be performed in a dark room. The
vessel should also be wrapped foil when not used.




Observations/Summary:

  * ### Removed the gels from the inserts. 

  * ### Used needle to remove the gel from the conical insert. All the gels stayed intact and did not break - rather elasticy   

  * ### The cell containing conical insert gel were different sizes. All of them smaller and white in colour compared to the control which remain clear-ish and did not shrink. (refer to image)
