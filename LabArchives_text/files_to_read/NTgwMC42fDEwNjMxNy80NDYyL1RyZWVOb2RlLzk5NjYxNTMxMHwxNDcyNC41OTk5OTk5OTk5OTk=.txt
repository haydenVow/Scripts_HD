A previous investigation aimed to optimise an animal component free (ACF)
media that promoted longer-term cell proliferation in myoblasts cells by
growing them in various formulations of ACF media. 10C ACF media was found to
enable longer-term cell proliferation past 10 doublings. We are now interested
in observing the effects of 10C ACF media on the cell growth of fibroblasts.
