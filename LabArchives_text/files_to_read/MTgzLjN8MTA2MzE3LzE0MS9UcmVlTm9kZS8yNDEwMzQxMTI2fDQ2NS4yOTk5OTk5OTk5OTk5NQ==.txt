AIM/PURPOSE: To explore the properties of the fibroblast WCB with respect to
suspension culture

HYPOTHESIS: That we will be able to adapt fibroblasts to suspension culture

RESULTS SUMMARY:

CONCLUSIONS:

NEXT STEPS:

  

  

Experimental plan: Fibroblast suspension culture

1\. Revive 1 x vial of Fibroblast WCB into 1 x T175 flask

2\. Perform 50% 24 hrs after initial thawing

3\. Passage fibroblasts 48 hrs after thawing at ~7K per cm2

4\. Perform 50% feed every 48-72 hrs until the cells are sufficiently
confluent to passage again. When a sufficient number of cells is reached,
adapt the fibroblasts to suspension culture.

5\. [DAY 1 of suspension] Depending on cell count, passage fibroblasts into
multiple E125 flasks at varying concentrations. At a minimum, begin with 10
million fibroblasts in 30mLs of media in 1 x E125 (3.33*10^5 cells per mL).

6\. [DAY 1 of suspension] Set the E125 flask on a shaker platform & keep at
constant agitation (100 rpm)

7\. [DAYS 2, 3] Monitor the E125 flask by taking aliquots of the suspension
and performing a cell count daily to assess cell proliferation or death.

8\. [DAY 4] After 72h, filter the media through a 40-70um filter to separate
the single cells from the cell aggregates. This selects for the cells that are
able to survive in single cell form. Take an aliquot for a cell count, then
spin down the filtrate (single cells in the media) at 3000 rpm for 5 minutes
to pellet the cells. Remove the spent media and re-suspend the pellet in fresh
media at 100-500k cells per mL (the higher the better!). Replace the flask on
the shaker platform & keep at constant agitation.

9. [DAY 7] Repeat the process of filtering, counting, and replacing the media every 2-3 days for 2-4 weeks or until cell numbers begin to double every 24-48 hours. Expect cell counts to drop dramatically during the first 2 weeks. Re-suspend in a few mililiters of media within 1 well fo a 6 well plate if needed. Don't get depressed! During week 3, cell numbers are expected to stay extremely low but hopefully will not continue to drop. During week 4, we expect to see cell numbers begin increasing again. At this point, cells will be fully adapted to suspension.

  

  

Note: To avoid weekend work, the process of filtering, counting, and re-
suspending could take place on monday, wednesdays, and fridays.
