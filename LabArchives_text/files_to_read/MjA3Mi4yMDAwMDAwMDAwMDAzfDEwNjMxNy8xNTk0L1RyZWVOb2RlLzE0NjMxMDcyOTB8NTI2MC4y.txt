Plates were returned to incubate (incubator 78), 37 degrees, 5% Co2 after they
were imaged.




Imaging set up used on the 2-zaber-intel-library was identical to the Day 1
imaging session, See that entry for plate imaging layout, exposure times and
lamp intensity. Setup changed slightly for 10-zaber-intel-library. Exposure
time was adjusted to 50ms and the phase lamp intensity was set on 1.
