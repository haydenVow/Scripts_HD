Bake dish with flour sieve and pizza lid (insert v1 prototype name) functional
test

Start date: 15/04/21

Operator: Chris O'Keeffe

Preparation:

  1. v1 was wrapped in aluminum foil and dry-autoclaved at 120C for 15 min
  2.  Afterwards, the assembly was placed on the lab bench to dry (still wrapped in foil)
  3.  V1 was ethanol-sprayed and transferred into the BSC and unwrapped
  4.  200 mL DMEM/F12 was added to the base of the dish, covering the sieve /scaffold area completely
  5.  4x parafilm strips were bundled up and hung over the bake dish edges to create an airgap between dish rim and pizza lid
  6. the parafilm spacers were taped in place with labeling tape and the entire assembly was transferred into the incubator at 11:45

Observations:

  1. Next day (16/04/21), the dish was transferred back to the BSC and disassembled for inspection
  2. Some passivation of the aluminum lid was observed due to oxidation in the high humidity environment. This is not a concern
  3. no deposits or rust was found, and no obvious contamination was observed
