Process:

Preparing BSA standard curve:

  * Make up stock of 2 mg/ml BSA solution
  * Perform serial dilutions to make up 2000, 1500, 1000, 750, 500, 250, 125, 25, 12.5, 6.75, 0 ug/ml solutions of BSA in triplicate (see plate map). Place on ice.

Improved freeze-thaw lysis method:

  * Remove media from wells and wash multiple times with PBS to remove serum proteins that may affect analysis. Last PBS wash should be just enough to cover wells ( 150uL)
  * Seal plate thoroughly with adhesive foil or similar
  * Place the plate directly in LN2 bath for 3 minutes.
  * Thaw in water bath for 3 minutes.
  * Repeat process 3 more times.

Cycle 1: 11:35 - 11:41  

Cycle 2: 11:41 - 11:46  

Cycle 3: 11:50 - 11:56  

  * Transferred lysates for each well to 1.8mL microfuge tubes.
  * Centrifuge tube/s at 650g for 5 mins. 2:15 - 2:20 am/pm
  * Aspirate 100uL of supernatant and transfer to corresponding well on a fresh non treated 96 well plate. Keep plate cold by placing on ice.
  * Perform dilutions in the well plate using water or PBS (ensure that whichever one that is used is also used as the blank) as the diluent.
  * Prepare parent, 1:2, 1:4 dilutions of sample in triplicate
  * In a new 96 well plate, add 250uL bradford reagent to the corresponding wells and 10uL of sample/standard.
  * Made BCA working reagent by adding 1:50 of reagent A to B.
  * Added 200uL of WR agent to 20uL of sample.
  * Mix well and spin plate down for 5 mins to remove bubbles (also the incubation time).
  * Read absorbance using plate reader.
