### Process:

  

1\. Fillled three 96 well plates with 300uL of dPBS and 200uL of tryple as per
the plate guide above. Filled another separate plate with growth media
(DMEM/F12+ 20% FBS + 1xP/S), 200uL per well.  

2\. Generated a multiwell open protocol using the 'Dynamo' script using the 1
well passaging protocol attached and the pick lists generated on the 6/5/22
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1yQD_JrhzktpQd0vaCt2B5OskKgl9SipLLab3WZ9v7ZU/edit#gid=1517361241

3\. Set up the opentron deck as per the layout at the top of the page using
cultures 11473-11476 and ran the generated multiwell protocol (see attached)

4\. Stopped the robot during it's passaged of culture 11474 (origin B) (See
observations). Decided to passage this plate by hand and add the cells
manually to the destination plate.

  * Removed and discarded growth media
  * washed each well with 200uL of dPBS
  * aspirated and discarded dPBS 
  * Added warmed tryple-EDTA to each well, 100uL and allowed to sit at room temp for 20 minutes. 
  * Mixed the contents of each well before transferring 20uL to the destination well listed in the resources file attached (See attachments)

6\. Allowed the protocol to run to completion.

7\. Transferred the new culture to incubate at 30 degrees, 5% CO2 incubator
#140.

  




Observations/Summary:

Attempted to introduce the following changes in the passaging protocol
compared to the Opentron Round 8 passage.  
  
1\. Reduce the tryple volume added to wells to 100uL from 200.  
2\. Pre heat the 96 well plates containing the dPBS and Tryple using a deck
heater element on the opentron to 37 degrees C.  
3\. After the tryple incubation in completed increase the mixing speed to
300uL/s (max) and add a total of 4x100uL mixing repetitions to each well prior
to cell transfer to the new seeding plate.  
4\. Retain the 20uL Tryple volume transfer to the new wells (1/5 of the total
cells from a confluent well).

A number of issues arose during this passaging process.

Passaging of plates 11473 and 11475

No plate was mixed after trypalisation, The pipette tip dipped to low into the
well, stabbing the well base and creating a seal at the base of the well. To
address this the mixing pipette height was increased from 0.5mm to 2mm from
the well base.

Passaging of plates 11474 and 11476

As well as the mixing step error outlined above both of these plates saw a
similar issue each the the pipette attempted to remove the media from the
ORIGIN plate. The minimum aspiration height for all steps in the protocol was
increased to 1.2mm from the well base.

For plate  11474, the protocol was stopped and the plate was passaged by hand,
with an empty plate added to the opentron deck in place of this culture to
continue carryout out the operation.

For plate 11476, the plate was not passaged by hand due to time constraints on
the day. Tryple was added to wells still containing growth media, therefore it
is unlikely that many (if any) cells were trypalised and transferred to the
destination plate.

Heating decks

Heating decks worked very well to bring the reagents up to temperature by the
time they were added to the wells, cells were noticeably detached after
completion of the protocol after inspecting down the microscope.
