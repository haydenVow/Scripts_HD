Staining

Prepared dead stain solution in amber/black centrifuge tube:  
\- 1 mL dPBS  
\- 1 drops Nucgreen AF488 dead stain  
\- Vortex for 5 seconds to mix

Prepared Hoechst stain (50 ug/mL) solution in amber/black centrifuge tube:  
\- 9500 uL MilliQ  
\- 500 uL Hoechst Trihydrochloride trihydrate (1mg/mL)  
\- Vortex for 5 seconds to mix. Solution can be stored at 4Â°C for up to 6
months

  1. Add 100 uL of each condition/sample to each well of 96-well plate
  2. Added 20 uL of Hoechst stain directly to cells
  3.  Added 80 uL of dead stain solution (dPBS+Nucgreen) to cells
  4. Incubated for 20 minutes in the dark at room temperature  
  5. Made 4x and 8x dilutions of the sample in dPBS.   

  6. Centrifuged plates at 300 RCF for 1 minute   
  

  7. Prepared plate map:  
\- Created a new "MIA output" data workbook by copying the template at the
following link:

OR
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xcd91iDvrnbp8GeXPJOyePzY0skm0JVVEZf7Ngk88NM/edit?usp=sharing  
\- Filled in each of the sheets according to how the samples were arranged  
\- Change the formula of the "Average Total cells" and "Average total dead
cells" in the "Final Output" tab to multiply by the total volume of your
culture eg. 5 mL for shake tubes, 20 mL for e125 flasks  
\- Pasted the link to the "MIA output" workbook here:  
  
  
  
Dilutions:

  8. Column 1: 50%
  9. Column 2: 25%
  10. Column 3: 12.5%
  11. Column 4: 12.5%

  

Conditions:

1\. Row A - MilliQ rep #1 (1-4) Tap rep #1 (5-8)

2\. Row B - MilliQ rep #2 (1-4) Tap rep #2 (5-8)

3\. Row C - RO rep #1

4\. Row D - RO rep #2

5\. Row E - Ultrapure distilled rep #1

6\. Row F - Ultrapure distilled rep #2

7\. Row G - Industrial distilled rep #1

8\. Row H - Industrial distilled rep #2




## Imaging

  1. Configure the Zaber session to image the entirety of each well; for 96 well plates this requires a 3 x 3 stitched image
  2. Take images of each well on the blue fluroescence ("DAPI") and green fluorescence ("AF488") channels




## Analysis

  1. Analyzed the blue- and green-channel images using the DAPI and AF488 MIA macros respectively.
  2. Downloaded and extracted the data then pasted it into the "MIA output" data workbook created in the "Staining" section.
  3. Copied the data from the "COPY ME INTO MASTER SPREADSHEET" sheet of the "MIA output" data workbook to the "Master Cell Counting Sheet" of the "Suspension culture counting spreadsheet": https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1YuTvXJXQQMIMwRZGeqNjdi20WeURg5FpM-1TJ-zrb1c/edit?usp=sharing




Observations/Summary  
  
Zaber observations

- Zaber seems out of focus between different wells despite being configured before imaging
