Process:

1\. Fill wells of new 48WP  with 1 mL of E6 media growth media (according to
plate map). Moved plate to incubator for at least 30 minutes. Timestamp: 11:05
- 11:35  

2\. Retrieve the culture plate from incubator.

3\. Using sterile tweezers or hands (whichever is easier), move the trays
containing well inserts into the new 48WP containing fresh, warm media.

  1. Please use the old lid that contains the culture ID's as the lid for the new plate
  2. Please parafilm the plate containing the inserts and scaffolds in the BSC before returning to the incubator. 

4\. Returned new plate to incubate at: 11:41
