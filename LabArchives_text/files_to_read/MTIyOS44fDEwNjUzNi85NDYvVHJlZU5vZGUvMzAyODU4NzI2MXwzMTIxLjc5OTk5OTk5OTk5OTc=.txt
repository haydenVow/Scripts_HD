50% Feed on 40x5CS


# Procedure - Feed

# Note: Fibroblasts do NOT require Gelatin coated Flasks, and do NOT require
p38i.  

  1. Turn on the water bath and set to 37'C.
  2. Aliquot  required growth media into a sterile container/s and place into the water bath. 
  3. Place in the water bath and heat for at least 20 minutes.
  4. Observe the cell flasks for confluence under the microscope using 4 x magnification and take images as required. Note: The confluence of cells must be <50% to perform cell feeding in P1-P3 and <80% in P4 prior to the cell differentiation stage. 
  5. Transfer flasks to the BSC and remove required volume of media from each flask (according to the Table below).
  6. Replace the same volume into each flask with the prepared growth media.
  7. Return the flasks to the incubators

Note: flask ID10248 had a "fluffy" like growth in the media of the flask. This
was noticed after the feed was performed and some of the growth came out into
the waste bottle. It looked very similar to the one seen in batch 30 passage 2
(17/01/22). After this was noticed all bottles in the hood were changed,
gloves were changed and the hood bench wiped down, feeding then proceeded with
other flasks.  
A similar infection was also seen in cultures in main lab and library lab. All
from the most recent CHOMP09 WCB
