Prepare materials for thaw and seed:

  * NOTE: IF PERFORMING A THAW FROM A CLONAL MCB_2 OR WCB_2, PREPARE AT LEAST ONE EXTRA 96 WELL PLATE FOR A DIFFERENTIATION ASSAY. THIS IS AN IMPORTANT QUALITY CONTROL STEP WHILE WE BUILD OUR CLONAL CELL BANK.
  * Suggested layout for diff assay (please refer to previous diff assays for exact seeding, feeding and analysis procedures)  

  * 

1\. Gelatin coated    x    flasks/plates with sterile filtered 0.1% gelatin
solution and then incubated all coated flasks at 37ºC

  * Time when all flasks placed into the incubator   : a/pm 

2\. Aliquotted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then
placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath for a minimum of 20 minutes
prior to use:

  *  Growth media (for seeding):    mL 
  * Time that aliquot was placed in the water bath to warm before use:   : a/pm 

  




## Thaw and seed vial:

3\. Collected the cryovial from Liquid Nitrogen storage & place in foam
floater in water bath for 5 min  : - : a/pm

Location where cryovial was collected from:

Vial details:     x    cryovials at   K  cells each for a total of    K  cells

Vial location:

Vial ID(s):

`4. Ethanol sprayed & transferred the vial(s) to the BSC.`

`5.  Added  µL of Growth Media (to generate a total volume of 1mL in the
cryovial) to the cryovial, resuspended the cell suspension gently to reduce
osmotic shock. `

`6. Collected the entire 1mL of cell suspension & transfer into the pre-warmed
tube of Growth Media. `

`7. Using a 10mL serological pipette, resuspended & distributed the cells
evenly in the   mL of pre-warmed Growth Media (prepared in Step 2). `

`8. Transfered   mL to each pre-coated    flask/well, allow to rest in the BSC
at RT for 30 min  : - : a/pm `

`9. Transfered flask/plate(s) to incubate at: `

  * [ ]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (aviary cells)

  

Making labels

Note - You will need to increase the passage number by one. (i.e. if your
thawed vial ID has a passage number of 3, when you make a culture ID for you
vessel you will need change the passage number to 4 on Airtable.)
