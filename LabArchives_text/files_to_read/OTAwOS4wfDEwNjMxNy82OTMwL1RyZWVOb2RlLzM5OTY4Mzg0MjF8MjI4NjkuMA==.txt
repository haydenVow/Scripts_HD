Passage 1 - 4x E125 into 4x E250


# Procedure - Passage

###

1\. Turn on water bath and set temperature to 37'C.

2\. Aliquot required volume of Growth Media in sterile tubes/pots. Refer to
Tables below for required volume.

3\. Place aliquots in pre-warmed water bath and leave for ~20 minutes or until
warmed.

4\. Transfer aliquots and flasks required for passage into the BSC.

5\. Dilute the suspension cells with the appropriate volume of Growth media
required to seed a larger vessel. See tables above.

6\. Once cells have been re-suspended in the total growth media transfer the
growth media + cells into each flask(s)

7\. Transfer the flasks into the 37'C incubator on a shaker platform at the
required RPM.
