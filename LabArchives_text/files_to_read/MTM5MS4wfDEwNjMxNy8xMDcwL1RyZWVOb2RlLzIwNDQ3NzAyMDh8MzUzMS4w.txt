RELATED TO MILESTONE: Milestone 2

AIM/PURPOSE: To further explore the promising ECM media conditions identified
in EPIC16065 'First biomaterials DSD experiment.'  

HYPOTHESIS:  That ECM media conditions 11, 1, 3, 5 will result in a
significantly higher scaffold confluence relative to ACF media alone after 7
days of differentiation. EPL coated zein scaffolds will result in
significantly higher scaffold confluence relative to uncoated zein scaffolds.  

RESULTS SUMMARY: See report

CONCLUSIONS: Overall, it was determined that E6 with 0.4 ug/mL of collagen,
laminin and fibronectin, and 0.1 ug/mL of vitronectin significantly improves
cell adhesion to Zein over 14 days in culture, compared with regular E6
medium. EPL coating does not significantly impact cell adhesion to Zein after
14 days in differentiation medium, and is therefore not necessary in future
scaffold experiments.

NEXT STEPS:

\- Differentiation assays on Zein scaffolds should now be performed using
condition 3 (E6 with 0.4 ug/mL of collagen, laminin and fibronectin, and 0.1
ug/mL of vitronectin) to promote prolonged cell adhesion

\- Media condition 3 should also be employed when performing differentiation
assays to test new scaffolds

\- EPL should not be used in future scaffold experiments as it does not
provide any benefits in terms of long-term cell adhesion to Zein scaffolds
