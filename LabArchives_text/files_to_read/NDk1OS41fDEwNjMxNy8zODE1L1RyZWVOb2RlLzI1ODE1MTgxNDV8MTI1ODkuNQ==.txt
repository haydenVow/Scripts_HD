## Performed by: LL  




Note: We are performing an adaption for serum free media and don't need a lot
of cells at this stage. Please passage and re-seed a T175 at 7k/ml. The
remaining cells can be discarded or given to anybody that wants them

Process:

1\. Aliquotted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then
placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath for a minimum of 20 minutes
prior to use:

  1. TrypLE:    10  mL 
  2. dPBS (for neutralising)    20  mL
  3. Growth media (for pellet resuspension):   3  mL
  4. Growth media (for seeding):    30   mL 
  5. Times that all aliquots were placed in the water bath to warm before use    11:04 

Note: if aliquots were placed in water bath at different times, record the
time stamp for each individual solution.




2\. Washed the flask(s) with dPBS.

3\. Added   10   mL tryple to each vessel/well and incubated at 37˚C for    12
min.  12:10 - 12:12  

Note: Fibroblasts typically require 15-18 minutes of incubation with tryple,
slightly longer than MuSCs.

4\. Neutralised with   10  dPBS (warmed) and combined cell suspension

5\. Centrifuged at 650 x g for 5 min

  1. Start/Finish time for centrifugation was    12:31    \-    12:36 




6\. Aspirated the supernatant(s)

7\. Resuspended pellet(s) in      20  mL    growth  media. Realised too late
that we didn't have enough medium - seeded in 20 mL, going to make more medium
this afternoon and will add 10 mL to culture  

8\. Performed a cell count using the haemocytometer and recorded the cell
count data in widget or the Google Doc spreadsheet called 'Cell Count
Spreadsheet' (see link below):

9\. Total cell number was:  3,016,000  

10\. Seeded ~7k cells per cm2 of the flasks/plates. Note that fibroblasts
prefer to be subcultured closely together.

11\. Volume of cell suspension required for subculture was:  0.812 mL  

12\. Transfer   812 µL of cell suspension to the pre-warmed  20 mL Growth
Media.

13\. Transfer cell suspension into (non-gelatin coated)   1 x T175  flask

14\. Transfer flask/plate(s) to incubate at:

  * [ ]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (aviary cells)  
  
15\. Added 10 mL warmed growth medium to culture: 15:18




Observations/Summary:

  




SOPs used:

1) fibroblasts formed sheet during Tryplisation - see images attached. Sheet
would not break up, even after pelleting - formed a mucus-like lump which had
to be discarded as it continuously blocked pipette tip. Cell count would
actually be far higher but couldnt include lump in count
