    1. 0.1     = Repeat current best media candidates in planar culture, comparison with ACF

    3. 0.5     = DSD has been designed in JMP and experimental work commenced 
    4. 0.75   = DSD/s has/have been completed and an improvement in MyoG observed

# Project: Muscle Stem Cells

Why is it important?

To grow protein at a scale sufficient to feed >8 billion people every day, we
need to maximise the protein yield per cell. The best protein/cell yield comes
from muscle, but only if we can produce large, mature muscle fibres.

What are the problems?

  * How do we grow myoblasts in suspension?
  * How do we increase the rate and efficiency of myoblast differentiation, fusion and maturation?
  * How do we induce myotube hypertrophy?
  * How do we do all of the above in ACF media?

Possible Objective

  * To generate a mature muscle product in ACF media

What do we want to achieve today?

1\. Define ONE clear objective per team

Successful completion of the objective MUST (less words the better) progress
our long-term strategic vision for feeding billions of people (Muscle)

2\. Define (no more than) THREE key results per team

Successful completion of all key results MUST be linked to successful
completion of the objective

3\. Surface some of our riskier ideas for discussion  

Let go of your inner skeptic! What are the experiments that no-one has ever
tried before?

4\. Come up with a team name and logo

Be creative, reflect the team. $200 swag budget

# Q3 objective

Each team will break off and have 1hr to discuss objectives

Successful completion of our objective MUST:

  * Progress our long-term strategic vision for feeding billions of people (Muscle)

(Note: Less is more when it comes to words needed to define the objective!)

What is the most impactful work we can produce this Quarter?

  1. Shaleen: 
    1. factors to improve maturation in a scalable vessel, scale protein productions, media components, knowledge
  2. Kylie: 
    1. grow mature MuSc at scale (on scaffolds in suspension)
  3. Jared: 
    1. implement a tool to assess muscle protein content, work towards ACF, pipeline to enable testing of various stimuli in parallel
  4. Ella: 
    1. media comp. to improve mat., we need to start seeing significant improvements in differentiation, bioreactor development, scaffold exploration, tools to assess protein content
    2. Media components to improve maturation (only seen expression of around 20% in serum controls, and no differentiation in ACF with DOLLY12) - this work could give some really nice images
    3. Bioreactor design (e.g. implementing electrical or mechanical stim) also impressive to investors, unique product
    4. Continued scaffold (external companies or internal fibro ecm sheets) or gel encapsulation (animal or recombinant gels) screening (and in line with this also the continued development of a method to assess differentiation in/on materials)
  5. Chris: 
    1. Improve protein expression of myoblast cultures x-fold

What questions do we need to answer to achieve this outcome?

  1. we need tools: ELISA pipeline, Western Blotting, Fluorescent Imaging
  2. are we looking at the right protein to assess? MF20 and MyoG is all we are staining for right now
  3. Reactor for stimulation
  4. parallel testing using multiple (smaller) reactors to assess effect of different stimuli in parallel, HTS reactor pipeline (DOE)
  5. ELISA and Image analysis automation (OT and software)
  6. custom design for DOE
  7. cost (for materials and number of experiment)
  8. commercial systems we can use to learn or adapt for our purposes (deNovo Matrix screening plates)

# Q3 key results

Each team will break off and have 1.5hrs to discuss key results

Successful completion of all key results MUST be linked to successful
completion of the objective ''Develop a process to improve myoblast
maturation.''

(Note: Use your SMART framework experience to set good, strong key results)

  * for all 2-3 KRs: if we achieve all our KRs, have we achieved our objective?
  * KRs are independent of monthly milestone framework, no need to talk about EPICs (Take note only for later discussion)
  * use SMART framework to set KRs: how do we score ourselves on progress towards achieving the KR?

Specific (simple, sensible, significant).

Measurable (meaningful, motivating).

Achievable (agreed, attainable).

Relevant (reasonable, realistic and resourced, results-based).

Time bound (time-based, time limited, time/cost limited, timely, time-
sensitive).

  

KR1:  Develop a high-throughput testing platform to increase myosin content by
2x using electrical/mechanical stimulation.

Notes:

  1. Plate assay, lid with electrodes/mechanical, autoclavable, sterile, control infrastructure outside the incubator, scalable, transferable to scaffolds, silicone?, use DoE to set up experiments, scalable. What are we quantifying in terms of maturation? Consideration = ELISA should be set up for analysis of MF20, PAX7. Gel contraction could be included in this as the mechanical stimulation.
  2.  \- Metric by which we measure this improvement may change! Can use the alignment analysis tools in ImageJ as part of our measurement. ELISA total amount of myosin present. Western blotting

KR2: Use DoE to optimise media conditions to achieve 60% of MyoG positive
cells (3x improvement)

Notes:

  1. Test this with at least two species (probably DOLLY and BUFFY, maybe KUZCO or other) NOTE \- Metric by which we measure this improvement may change!
  2.  ACF and Serum tested in parallel? NOTE \- Check with Marie on DSD set-up, baseline, and components for diff
  3.  ELISA needs to be set-up NOTE\- DenovoMatrix (screening plate)
  4. Test with scaffolds
  5. Tool development: ELISA pipeline in place for assessing maturation Alignment tool in Image J
  6. cell line? Dolly, Kuzco, Buffy, clonal or heterogeneous?

# High-reward activities

Does not have to be related to OKR, but Vow`s longterm mission

  * New scaffold exploration/screening
  * Testing MuSCs in gels

Jared's ideas:

  * Alignment studies
  * Drink cells (energy drink/protein shake!)
  * Collagen as a scaffold (recombinant made in yeast)
  * MuSC fibroblast co-culture
  * Hormesis ? Induce stress to increase yield/decrease apoptosis, light therapy

Kylie's ideas:

  * Work with the food team more to develop scaffolds
  * Screen new scaffolds
  * Experiments on flavour and colour of media
  * Testing of media expiration limits (recycle it?) and light sensitivity
  * Automating media feeds

Chris's ideas: Microcarrier Synthesis in house:

  * supply chain independence and cost savings
  * independent product line to sell
  * modify MC matrix and coating to tailor properties (edible MCs, tailored surface for each cell line)
  * gentle and efficient harvest methods

Shaleen's ideas:

  * Proliferation on microcarriers in an E2000
  * Getting muscle cells adapted to suspension with anti-clumping agents
  * MuSC fibroblast co-culture just in a Tflask together (seed fibros lower)

* * *

Ella's ideas:

  * Screen scaffolds from external providers as they come in (Gelatex, Danagreen, Tantti, Inovenso, Matrix Meats)
  * Continue optimisation of fibroblast cell sheets for scaffolds
  * Use of recombinant/animal proteins to suspend cells in gels (collagen, fibrin and thrombin)
  * Work with chefs/food team and plant based products to generate new in-house scaffolds (porous)
  * Tension based growth of fibroblasts as scaffolds - form thick bands between pins - progressively move apart? Pins could also be electrodes?
  * Use of articifical bone in products (replace pins, stiff substrate to guide cells, could also be micro patterned)
  * Spin coated materials on micro patterned surfaces - alignment
  * Protein assays and western blots
  * Self assembly/organoid culture
