RELATED TO MILESTONE/KEY RESULT:  KR2, increasing MyoG positive cells to > 60%

AIM/PURPOSE: Supplementation is a promising method to stimulate muscle growth
and maturation. In order to screen large numbers of components and their
concertive effect at various concentration levels, we employed definitive
screening design (DSD) methodology to identify a media formulations capable of
improving MuSC differentiation relative to our baseline E6 differentiation
medium.

HYPOTHESIS:  At least 1 of the 26 media combinations tested will be capable of
promoting differentiation relative to our current baseline E6 media, based on
MyoG and/or MF20 expression.

RESULTS SUMMARY:

  * A pre-screen experiment showed some subjective promise in some factors, however no quantitative data could be obtained due to unrelated cell death issues.
  * The initial run suggested that several of the factors selected were either cytotoxic, used at concentrations that were cytotoxic, or had an cytotoxic combination effect.
  * use of liquid handling automation is vastly beneficial to scaling and improving robustness of combinatorial supplementation studies

CONCLUSIONS: We were unable to obtain quantitative results due to a large
degree of non-experiment-related cell death during this experiment and the
repeat runs. Additionally, given the uncertainty over cytoxicity of certain
compounds at different concentrations, we should have tested the factors at
different concentrations first to optimise that before attempting to mix them
in a DSD format.

NEXT STEPS:

  * Screen ALL available media components individually across a broad range of concentrations before mixing up a full DSD
  * From this screening, select only the beneficial factors at their optimal concentrations for a DSD mixing protocol
  * Develop a process to assess cell growth/maturation over the course of the experiment to collect more datapoints leading up fo final analysis
  * Investigate the process of pH-balancing media conditions. Many of the conditions are acidic, so cell death could be due to a pH imbalance
