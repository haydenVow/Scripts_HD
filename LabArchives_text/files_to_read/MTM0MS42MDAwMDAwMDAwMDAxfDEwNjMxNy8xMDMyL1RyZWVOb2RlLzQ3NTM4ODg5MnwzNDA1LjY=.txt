Hospital, Oswestry/Keele University, UK, karina.wright1@nhs.net

Dr Wright's research interests in Regenerative Medicine are in understanding
the biology of cartilage and bone injury and osteoarthritis, and in developing
clinical diagnostic and predictive tests for the assignment of cartilage bone
and spinal cord injury treatments. She is also interested in developing novel
cell based therapies using bioreactors for the treatment of musculoskeletal
injury and diseases

An incredibly talented mathematician and logical thinker. Currently runs his
own company where he builds and runs optimisation models on market trading
strategies. Have spoken to him many times about Vow's media optimisation
challenges and has many good ideas on how we can think about this optimisation
problem using DoE and other optimisation techniques.
