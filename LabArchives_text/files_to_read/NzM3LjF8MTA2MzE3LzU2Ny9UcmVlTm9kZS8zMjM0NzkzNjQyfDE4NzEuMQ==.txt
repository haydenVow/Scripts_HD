Observations

Very few cells were observed to be attached to the agarose scaffolds.  
  
Cell seeding on the zein pieces was variable. There was one small fraction of
zein scaffold that had broken way from the main piece, which was well
populated with cells. The main piece may have been well seeded on the other
side, but was no images were taken on this side.  
  
The gelatin scaffold on the other hand, was densely populated with an
estimated surface coverage of 80-90%. |  
  
Both the gelatex zein and gelatin samples did not appear to become
contaminated after their dry heat treatment and 4 day duration in cell
culture. Thus, suggesting that the dry heat treatment sufficiently sterilised
the samples.




Future directions  
  
Based on these preliminary findings we will continue to proceed with the
screening of the Gelatex samples. However, it appears as though freeze dried
agarose is not a promising scaffold candidate.
