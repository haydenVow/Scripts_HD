Aim / Goal


Viabiility stain with propdium iodide (dead cells) with a Hoechst 33342
counter nuclei stain.


Hypothesis


Should see cell clumping within material, with a heterogenous population of
live/dead cells.


Protocol


  

## Before Starting, ensure the following is completed:

  * Label the 24-WP with the culture IDs for each scaffold in the staining well plate. You may have to stain in a 12-WP if the gel scaffold has expanded. 
  * Acquire sterile spoons for transporting the gels into the staining plate. 
  * Create the stain solution (2ug/mL concentration; Propidiumm Iodide (1ug/mL)/Hoechst 33342 (1ug/mL) [50:50]) 
    * Total volume needed: 12 mL (make up 13 mL)

## Perform the live-dead stain protocol.

1\. Remove the scaffold-cultures from the incubator

2\. Transfer each scaffolds to a  24 WP using a sterile spoon (forceps may
damage the structural integrity).

4\. Incubate for 20 mins with 500uL stain solution per well (2ug/mL of
Propidiumm Iodide (ID: ???) / Hoechst 33342 (ID: 8157)) in PBS (ALQ ID:
12837).  1507 PM Media ID: 12912

5\. Remove excess media so that scaffolds sit on the bottom of well without
moving.

6\. Image the stained scaffolds with the Zaber.  1537- PM

  * Phase, nuclei (355)  dead (555)
  * 10x magnification
  * Exposure: 20-30 ms
  * Imaging Sites: 7-7
  * 50um overlap
  * Spacing rule: field of view 
  * Visit order: snake 

  

  


Observations / Ranger


Visual Observations:

Low Alginate Suspension: 50/50 cell death. Cells remain in suspension form,
the clusters occurring are clusters of single cells rather than fused cells,
suggesting cells proliferate but do not migrate. Thorough infiltration of
cells throughout gel.

Low Alginate Adherent: 50/50 cell death. Cells clusters looked like fused
cells, suggesting cells proliferate but do not migrate. Thorough infiltration
of cells throughout gel.

Med Alginate Suspension: Less death than low alginate. Cells remained in
suspension form, however there were less clusters than in low alginate.

Med alginate adherent: Thorough infiltration of cells throughout gel, less
cell death compared to low alginate adherent. The cell death observed seems to
be from initial seeding as it does not correspond with cell clusters. Not
enough evidence to suggestion migration of the cells.

  

Overall: It appears that cells that were by themselves during initial seeding
died, while larger clusters of cells proliferated. This suggests higher cell
seeding density will be preferred by the cells, however considering how
quickly the media is used, the media to scaffold ratio will have to have to be
quite high.
