Observations: Please note and signs of leakage, comment on the status of the
ice/gel packs (melted/cold to touch ect). Upon handling the tissue samples
(still inside their container/bag), note whether the tissue samples are cold
to the touch or not. This serves as a simple gut-check that the samples have
indeed arrived in a chilled state.

Biopsy Process  

Preparing the sterile field.

  1. Cavicide and ethanol spray the bench-top and let it sit for 5 minutes. Ensure there is a waste bin/ container nearby. 
  2. Cover the bench-top with a sterile plastic covering that is taped at the corners to not move around.
  3. Pour a small volume (30-50 mL) of povidone iodine solution into a kidney dish. And lay out the scapels, kitchen knife, and scissors ready for use.   
  
Preparing the tissue

  1.  Wear rubber gloves with sterile latex gloves on top. 
  2. Orientate yourself with the urchin's mouth and external anatomy. 
  3. Sprayed the whole urchin liberally with 70% ethanol and wiped clean with sterile gauze and let it sit for 5minutes with the mouth facing upwards. 
  4. Pour a small volume (30-50 mL) of povidone-iodine solution into a sterile kidney dish and apply to the external surface of the urchin. Begin with the spikes and end with the mouth opening facing upwards.
  5. Dab the boundaries and centre of the mouth with iodine soaked gauze in one direction. 
  6. Use sterile forceps to dab the sample with the iodine soaked gauze. Once covered, allowed the iodine to sit for 5 minutes 
  7. Repeated the iodine treatment
  8. Dabbed away excess iodine using a fresh, sterile gauze. 

Taking the biopsies from the tissue

  1. Ensure the urchin are in a fridge or on ice prior to use.
  2. Use the pointed end of a sharp kitchen knife to cut around the boundary of the urchin's mouth. Use your free hand to slowly rotate the urchin as you direct the knife around the mouth's boundary. 
  3. Using sterile forceps and a sterile scalpel, cut a shallow (2-3 mm deep) outline of the area that is to be the source for the biopsy
  4. Use tweezers to remove the mouth and pour out any of the liquid/ water inside the opening into waste.  
  

  5. Reorientate yourself with the the 'triangles' on the external shell. these triangles align with the 5 rows of roe. 
  6. Use kitchen shears to follow these triangles and cut 5-10cm on opposite sides of the mouth. 
  7. Carefully cut away the top layer of tissue inside the outline from the previous step.
  8. Insert both thumbs into the mouth and push against your thumbs and pull out to break the external shell in half. 
  9. Wear new (double) gloves with sterile surgical gloves  on top
  10. Remove the gonads with sterile tweezers and lay flat on sterile drape. 
  11. Wash ovaries 2-3x with sterile CMF-SW with antibiotics.
  12. For animal 1: 1 gonad was frozen and reserved for histology and proteomics. The remaining gonad was transferred to a BSC for further isolation (See Processing New biopsy for Animal 1, biopsy 1).
  13. For animal 2: both gonads were collected. Cells were stringently washed as described above. Internal cavity of the urchin was washed with CMF-SW with 1% antibiotic/antimycotic solution. 
  14. Remove coelomic epithelium and dissect ovaries into small sections in the centre of the gonad tissue, roughly a minimum size of 10x10x10mm. 
  15. Place the first biopsy into a 50 mL tube containing 10 mL  of Artifical Sea Water to wash, then transferred to the collection media tube containing 10 mL  of Artifical Sea Water. 
  16. Photographed the biopsy site  
  17. Repeated all steps above for each new biopsy
