## Process

1\. Collected the cryovial from Liquid Nitrogen storage & place in foam
floater in water bath for 3 min, from 4:00-4:03 pm

Location where cryovial was collected from:

Brew

Tower/Bucket # 4

Box/Cane # 7

Vial location: A1

Vial ID(s): 13552

2\. Thawed vial in water bath, 30Â°C for 3 minutes

`3. Ethanol sprayed & transferred the vial(s) to the BSC.`

`4. Added 0.5 mL of serum-free media (SFM; DF12 without FBS) to cryovial (to
bring total volume to 1mL) drop-wise. Resuspended cells gently using P1000 `

`5. ``Collected entire volume containing cells from cryovial and deposited
into 15mL tube. Pelleted cells by centrifugation at 300xg for 5 minutes`

`6. Aspirated media without disturbing pellet and resuspended in 2mL SFM`

`7. Cells for further use in encapsulation experiment (see entry ``here`` for
details)`
