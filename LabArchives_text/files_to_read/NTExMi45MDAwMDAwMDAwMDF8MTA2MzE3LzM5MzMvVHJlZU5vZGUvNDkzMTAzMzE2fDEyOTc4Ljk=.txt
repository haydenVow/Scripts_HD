### Process:

1\. Took image of vessel with microscope on phase setting. If the flasks look
as confluent as expected for day 3, you don't need to perform a cell count
because all cells will be transferred to a 4CF.

2\. Gelatin coated     1     x    4CF      vessel  with sterile filtered 0.1%
gelatin solution and then incubated all coated flasks at 37˚C.

  1. Time when all vessels(s) placed into the incubator       14:28   pm 

3\. Aliquotted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then
placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath for a minimum of 20 minutes
prior to use:

  1. TrypLE:         mL in 
  2.  dPBS (At 37 degrees for washing):         mL 
  3.  dPBS (at RT neutralising):         mL 
  4. Growth media (for pellet resuspension):         mL 
  5. Growth media (for seeding):         mL  
  
Sylvana put the entire bottle of mix/aliquots above into the water bath.

Time that all aliquots were placed in the water bath the warm before use
15:00   pm

Note: if aliquots were placed in water bath at different time, record the time
stamp for each individual solution.




4\. Removed vessel(s) from the incubator     16:30 pm

5\. Washed the vessel(s) with dPBS (warmed).

6\. Added     10    mL tryple to each vessel/well and incubated at 37˚C.

  1. Start/Finish for TrypLE was    16 :40 pm  \- 16:50 PM  

7\. Neutralised with     10     dPBS and combined cell suspension into a
2X 50mL    tube.

8\. Centrifuged at 650 x g for 5 min.

  1. Start/Finish time for centrifugation was     16:58  pm 




9\. Aspirated the supernatant(s).

10\. Resuspended pellet(s) in     10    mL          media     17: 10  pm

11\. Aliquoted     2x30uL     of resuspended cells into a microcentrifuge tube
for cell count.

12\. Performed a cell count using the haemocytometer and recorded counts in
"Seed Calculator" widget (see below):




13\. Transferred     all      of cell suspension to the pre-warmed        600
mL Growth media:      17:12    pm

14\. Transferred cell suspension into the             pre-gelatin coated
4CF     vessel.

15\. Left at RT in the BSC for 30 min to allow cells to settle      17:12  \-
17:35 pm  

16\. Transferred vessel(s) to incubate at:

  * [x]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells) thermo incubator or library lab incubator (if there's space)
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (avian cells)
