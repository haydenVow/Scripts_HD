RELATED TO MILESTONE:  Establish a WCB for fibroblasts (exploration, given
that we achieved this milestone early)

AIM/PURPOSE: To see if we can form fibroblast aggregates

HYPOTHESIS: That treatment with TGFb, Vitamin C, and shaking will induce
formation of fibroblast aggregates.

RESULTS SUMMARY: See Report.

CONCLUSIONS: Macroscopic fibroblast aggregates formed which were delivered to
the food team for analysis.

NEXT STEPS:

  1. Kick-off follow-up experiment with more controls to determine the optimal conditions for forming aggregates.
  2. Prepare to deploy aggregates into production for Project Artemis
