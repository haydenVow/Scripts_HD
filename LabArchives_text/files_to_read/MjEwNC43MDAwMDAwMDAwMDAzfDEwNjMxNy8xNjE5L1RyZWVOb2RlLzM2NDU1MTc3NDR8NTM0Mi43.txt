## Performed by: KK and SS  




Reagent preparation:

Use the following spreadsheet to:

  * Determine the total amount of regent required for primary staining
  * Provide more information on antibody types

1\. Prepared   6.4 mL  PBST (0.2% Triton-X)

2\. Prepared    6.4 mL  blocking buffer: PBST (0.1% Triton-X + PBS) + 3%
bovine serum albumin (BSA). (Kept in the fridge until needed in blocking step)

3\. Prepared Primary Antibody Mix: :  20 µL   Primary #1 MyoG (Santa Cruz)
(1:200  ) +  80 µL   Primary #2 MF20 (DSHB)   (1:50  ) +  3.9  mL Blocking
Buffer

Pipette-mixed antibody mix and stored refrigerated away from light until
needed.




Antibody used

PrimaryMouseMyoGIgG1Mouse Anti-MyoG (IgG1)1:200Santa Cruz

Antibody Primary - Mouse Anti-MyoG, MIgG1 Kappa Light Chain (AKA F5D-s
Myogenin)

  
  
PrimaryMouseMF20IgG2bMouse Anti-MF20 (IgG2b)1:50DSHB

Antibody Primary - Mouse Anti-Myosin (MF20), MIgG2b, Kappa Light Chain (AKA MF
20-s)

  
  
  
  




Process:

Permeabilise

1\. Removed PBS from each well.

2\. Added  100 µL PBST (0.2% Triton-X) to each well for 15 min:  16:14 - 16:29
pm

3\. Aspirated PBST for each well.




Blocking

1\. Added  100 µL of blocking buffer (3% BSA in PBST [0.1% Triton-X]) and
incubate for 45 minutes - 1hr at RT. (no more than 1 hour):   16:33 - 17:20 pm




Single/Simultaneous Primary Antibody staining

1\. Removed blocking buffer from each well.

2\. Incubated cells with primary antibody for 90min - 2hrs at RT, or 4ºC
overnight:   17:23 - Overnight a/pm

3\. Parafilmed plates and stored at 4ºC in tissue culture lab Fridge.

After this step, all further task should be performed in a dark room. The
vessel should also be wrapped foil when not used.

Observations/Summary:

  * The plate was semi frozen after collecting from the fridge. 
  * Each well contains both MyoG and MF20 antibodies as these were added together in one mix. This is a mistake and does not follow the original plan of having MyoG and MF20 seperated in different wells.  

  




### Results:

  * Results were;
    * [x ]  As Usual (this is a repetitive task)
    * [ ]  Unexpected because...
    * [ ]  Need to be further analysed
    * [ ]  Other (.......)
