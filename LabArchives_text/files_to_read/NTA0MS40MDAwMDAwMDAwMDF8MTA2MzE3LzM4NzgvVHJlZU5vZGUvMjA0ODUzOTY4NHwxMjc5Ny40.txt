Reagent preparation:

3\. Prepared Secondary Antibody mix (pipette from the top/supernatant of
antibody solution):

  15 µL   Secondary #1   (1:1000  ) +  15 µL   Secondary #2   (1:1000  ) +  15
mL Blocking Buffer (PBST (0.1% Triton X + dPBS) + 3% BSA)  

If using AlexaFluor secondary antibodies then the max concentration should be
1:500 (typically used at 1:1000)

Pipette-mixed antibody mix and stored refrigerated away from light until
needed.

4\. Prepared DAPI mix:

   15 mL  PBS +    15 uL  of DAPI

Vortexed DAPI mix and stored refrigerated away from light until needed.

  

DAPI and seconday located in the staining fridge in 15mL black tubes

Process:

1\. Removed plate from fridge (incubated in primary antibodies overnight). - 2
x E-STIM plates (12wp) and 1 x 96 wp

2\. Washed 3 times for 5 min with PBS at RT.

 11:18 - 11:26 pm

 11:26 - 11:36 pm

 11:36 - 11:48 pm

3\. Incubated the cells with secondary antibody mixture in the dark at RT for
1 hour.  11:59 - 12:59 pm (140 uL for 96 wp and 400 uL for 12 wp)

NOTE: from this step onwards protect from the light by wrapping plates in foil
and perform experiment in the dark.




Counter staining

1\.  Removed 2nd antibody solution.  12:01 pm

2\.  Washed with DAPI (1:1000) in PBS for 5 min at RT in the dark.

13:11 pm

3\.  Washed in PBS 3 x 5 min at RT in the dark. (No Triton)

13:20 pm

13:25 pm

4\.  Replaced dPBS.

13:30 pm

  




SOPs used:

  * SOP_Immunofluorescence Staining V_02

  




Observations/Summary:

Could not wash one E-stim plate after DAPI (#7996). However stains were
validated on Axio to ensure that imaging could be done. Plates are foil
wrapped and in fridge lower shelf.
