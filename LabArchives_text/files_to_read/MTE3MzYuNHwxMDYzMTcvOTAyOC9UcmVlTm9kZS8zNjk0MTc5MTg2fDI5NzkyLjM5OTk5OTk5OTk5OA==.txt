Media/Reagents used:  

Name  
Tryple  
dPBS (for washing & neutralising)  
Growth Media (DMEM/F12+20% FBS + 1xP/S  
Dilution media (DMEM/F12 + 1xP/S)  
  
  




### Process:






4\. Aspirated and discarded media from the flask

5\. Washed the vessel(s) with 10mL dPBS (room temp)

6\. Discarded wash then added    10 (T175) 6ml (T75)     mL tryple to each
vessel/well and incubated at 30ËšC, 5% CO2 for 10 minutes.  

7\. Neutralised with     EQUAL VOLUMES     of dPBS to Tryple and transferred
cell suspensions from each flask into separate     1x50mL    tubes.

8\. Cells were spun at 500 g for 5 minutes.

9\. Cells were resuspended in 10 mL of respective growth media (20% FBS growth
media or 10% growth media made by diluting the 20% FBS growth media with
dilution media).  

Took 20uL of each resuspension for a cell count as per instructions below.




CELL COUNT

12\. Performed a cell count using the haemocytometer and recorded the cell
count data in the Google Doc spreadsheet: Cell Count Spreadsheet or cell count
widget below.

  1. Total cell number for cultures 12945: 4,120,000
  2. Total cell number for culture 12946: 2,080,000
  3.  Volume of cell suspension required for subculture: 
    1. (2xT75 culture in 20% FBS media), 5mL of cell suspension, 1.04x10^6 cells per flask
    2. (4xT175 culture in 10% FBS media)  2.5mL of cell suspension 1.035x10^6 cells per flask  

Volumes of cell suspensions above were aliquoted into T flasks containing
respective media, 30mL of media in a T175 flask + cell suspension volumes
above

  1. Flask was transferred to incubate at 30 degrees 5% CO2, incubator 68.
