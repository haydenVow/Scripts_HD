Process:

  1. Aliquotted  3 x 9mL  mL of  RPMI Media 
  2. Aliquotted  3 x 9mL  mL of  Opti Media 
  3. Aliquotted  2 x 9mL  mL of  LDF Media 
  4. Left at Room temperature   15:44 pm 
  5. Removed  100  % of supernatant from vessel. Collected and pooled together supernatant from each group and plated into a separate 60mm plate
  6. Replaced with  3 mL (per well) of  respective   media. 
  7. Returned vessel to incubate at: 16:15 pm

  * [ ]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (aviary cells)
  * [ x ] 26C, 5% CO2 (aquatic fish cells)

  

  * Incubator (#Thermo  ), Lab [Yurt]




### Observations/Summary:

Supernatant from 8 x conditions were pooled into individual 60mm plates

Each well then underwent a 100% feed with its respective media.

  

Cultures discarded:

  * Biopsy 1, Digest 3
  * Biopsy 1, Digest 2
  * Biopsy 3, Digest 1 (LDF media only, not RPMI or Opti)
  * Connective tissue explant
  * Fin explant

All obviously contaminated and bleached/discarded.
