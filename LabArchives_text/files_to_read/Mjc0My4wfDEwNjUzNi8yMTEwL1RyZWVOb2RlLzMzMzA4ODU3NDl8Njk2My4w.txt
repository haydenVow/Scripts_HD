Mix started 1336

L-Alanyl-L-Glutamine added in at the same time as bicarb.

Sulfurous smell detected on outline valve of media tank by Matthew 1422

MAJOR DEVIATION REPORTED BY SR:

\- Re-circulation pump stopped being able to effectively recirculate media at
1415 after the addition of bicarb and L-Alanyl-L-Glutamine

\- Consulted with Jared and Matthew, issue determined to be poweder blockage
in T Junction at base of tank.

\- Peristaltic pump used to reverse flow, bubbles were seen coming up through
media.

\- When media was pumped through to STR2000 a vacuum formed. Due to the
blockage completely closing off outlet.

\- Matthew and Adrian used a long clean metal rod to dislodge the blockage,
white powder (either bicarb or Ala-glutamine) was seen in line near tank but
did not come through or it had dissolved prior to reaching filter.

FUTURE SOLUTION

\- Add bicarb or glutamine in liquid form to media tank.

09:00 - Adrian inspects the 2000L bag and notes the cloudiness of the media
inside. Other members of the mfg also note the cloudiness and unusual smell
present in the bioreactor room. Ideally if the media is contamination free the
impeller should visible from the viewing ports, however they were completely
obscured.

09:30 - Sample retrieved from the bioreactor by manually removing one of the
aseptiquik connectors from the sampling line and attaching a one-way luer lock
valve. Samples are retrieved.

09:35 - Samples are stained with trypan blue and observed under the
microscope. Movement and morphology appears to be bacterial cells. See images
and video below.

10:15 - Contamination reported in foundry ops slack channel
