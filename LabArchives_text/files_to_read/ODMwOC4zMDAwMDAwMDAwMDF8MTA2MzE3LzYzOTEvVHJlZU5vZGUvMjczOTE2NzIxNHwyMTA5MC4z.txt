Plan: 6 well plate nucleofections. 15 wells per guide and 18 wells for
controls = 48 wells total

Prepare guides/cas9/Cas9 electroporation enhancer

  1. PTEN and PABPC1 guides in TE buffer (44 uM) (stored at -20) were retrieved from the freezer
  2. Made up Cas9 mix. *Below is a 1 x mix for 1 well, multiply by number of wells you intend to make x 1.2 to get total volume required for experiment.

4\. Incubated mix for 10-20 min, (tubes were left in the bench hood for 10
minutes to incubate from [TIMESTAMP]

5\. While incubating, the electroporation enhancer was prepared.

  1. Electroporation Buffer was removed from -20 freeze and thawed in palm (or made up to 100uM in TE buffer if new).
  2. Mxes for each guide were made up to 10.8 uM solutions using 1 x TE buffer. *Below is a 1 x mix for 1 well, multiply by number of wells you intend to make x 1.2 to get total volume required for experiment.

Prepare Cells for nucleofection

  1. 6 well plates were prepared to receive nucleofected cells (8 plates total). wells required were filled with 3 mL of DMEM/F12 + 20% FBS WITHOUT ANTIBIOTICS! 
  2. 6 well plates were placed in the incubator (30 degrees, 5% CO2) to warm plates with media at 12:00pm. 
  3. Cells used were of a low passage number, thawed and out of frozen storage for at least 3 days and appear happy and live. [Cell culture ID: 10385, 10386, 10387, 10388] 
  4. Media was removed from cells, PBS washed with 10 mL per flask and tryplised with 10 mL tryple per flask, cells in tryple were incubated for 5 minutes at 30 degrees, 5% CO2.
  5. tryple was neutralised with     10  mL PBS per flask
  6. Cells were placed in a falcon tube
  7. Cells were centrifuged at 300g for 5 minutes before being resuspended in DMEM/F12 + 20% FBS (NO PENSTREP)
  8. cell count was performed under hemocytometer using an aliquot of these suspended cells, mixed with trypan blue (mix ratio: )
  9. The number of cells required for the experiment was determined. 0.4 x 10^5 cells required per well.
    1. Cells for PTEN transfection = 0.4*10^5 x 13 = 6.0x0^6
    2. Cells for PABPC1 transfection = 0.4*10^5 x 13 = 6.0x10^6
    3. Cells for Control (Cas9, no guide) = 0.4*10^5 x 7 = 2.8x10^6  
We therefore need 20.4 x 10^6 cells  
  10. The required cell number was pipetted into a 1.5mL sterile eppendorf tube
  11. Cells were centrifuged for 5 mins at 300g at room temp [TIMESTAMP]
  12. Supernatant was removed
  13. The pellet was resuspended in    1     mL 1x PBS (20.4x10^6 cells/mL) 
  14. Three 1.5mL sterile eppendorf tubes were set up inside the BSC and labelled 1-3. volumes of cell suspension in dPBS were transferred to each tube as per the guide below. 
    1. Tube 1 - PTEN: 394uL 
    2. Tube 2 - PABPC1: 394ul
    3. Tube 3 - Control: 212ul 
  15. The cells were centrifuged at 300g for 5 mins at room temp (HINGE OUT IN CENTRIFUGE)
  16. The supernatant was removed from each tube. It is important to remove as much as possible. Use a 1 mL tip to remove most of the supernatant and then switch to a 200 uL pipette to remove a little more if necessary. Do not disturb the pellet.
  17. To each Eppendorf tube the following mix was prepared, R buffer added first.

20\. Cells were placed back in the incubator for 72 hours.




## Observations

1\. Guides and Cas buffers were left out at room temp for >20 minutes, Roughly
1h to 1-15minutes.

2\. Cell counts should be done before buffers are made to avoid wastage of Cas
protein and guides.

3\. When reconstituting the guide, move them straight to the freezer at -20

4\. Ensure that the pellet is split while resuspended in dPBS prior to
addition of R buffer.

5\. Ensure that centrifuge steps are all done to 5 minutes.

6\. We need to know the growth rates of new cell types to estimate proper cell
numbers prior to planning nucleofection days.

7\. Doubling time of F_Chomp_07 was estimated to 9.6 days from thaw.  




## Reference Images:

Images of cells in some flasks were captured prior to their passage and
subsequent nucleofection. Images were captured at 4x using Phase imaging.

Culture 10338  

Culture 10335  

 Cultures 10336 and 10337 looked similar in morphology and confluence to these
cells, images were not captured from these flasks and confidence to proceed to
with passage was established based on the images above.
