We have previously tested the effect of using a 500x E6 bullet on C2C12
differentiation. We found that there was no significant difference when
comparing percentage of MyoG positive cells differentiated in E6 made from
fresh or E6 made from bullet. However, the bullet used in this previous
experiment was made and used on the same day. Additionally, it was stored at 4
degrees C rather than frozen. For more details see EPIC16716.

This experiment will test the effect of making a 500x bullet and freezing it
before use. Making E6 bullets and then using them at a later time to make E6
media will allow us to make this media much faster and more efficiently,
especially if it needs to be made in large volumes, as is the case for
production.
