Process:

  1. Image each flask on Phase.
  2. Aliquotted  2.7 mL  mL of  each growth Media into  1 tube each  . Placed in water bath    :   \-  :  
  3. Removed  50  % of supernatant from vessel. 
  4. Replaced with  2.5 mL (per well/per vessel) of  resepective growth   media (see table above). 
  5. Returned vessel to incubate at: 

  * [X]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (aviary cells)

  

  * Incubator (#Thermo  ), Lab [Main]




### Observations/Summary:

 50 % media changed was not performed as cells in all T25 flasks appeared dead
(round and floating). Therefore, the experiment was terminated.
