DOLLY12_11E7 Differentiation Assay Experimental Plan


Note* Plan written 14APR21 when cells had already been seeded on 12APR21 into
2 x 96-well plates (6 wells per plate).

Based on visualisation of cells (plate 1, plate 2) on 14APR21:

Wed 14APR21: 50% Feed 12 x wells in 96-well plates (2 plates with 6 wells
each).

Fri 16APR21: D0D Change to E6/2% HS Diff media (3 wells in E6 / 3 wells in
DMEM + 2% HS + 1X P/S) for each plate

Sat 17APR21: D1D 100% Feed E6/2% HS wells respectively

Sun 18APR21: D2D 100% Feed E6/2% HS wells respectively

Mon 19APR21: D3D 100% Feed E6/2% HS wells respectively

Tue 20APR21: D4D 100% Feed E6/2% HS wells respectively

Wed 21APR21: D5D 100% Feed E6/2% HS wells respectively

Thu 22APR21: D6D Fix cells with 4% PFA and Primary stain for MyoG/MF20 [IF
ENOUGH TIME - Secondary Stain AF488/AF555  \- Image for DAPI / MyoG-AF488 /
MF20-AF555]  

Fri 23APR21: [IF UNABLE TO DO ON THURSDAY] - Secondary Stain AF488/AF555  \-
Image for DAPI / MyoG-AF488 / MF20-AF555

Determine whether cells can differentiate
