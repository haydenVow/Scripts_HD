Electrical stimulation has been found to increase myogenic maturation, myotube
formation and alignment. This is demonstrated in literature through enhanced
myosin heavy chain expression and increased myogenic markers MyoD and desmin
(Serena et al., 2008). Most stimulating setups use charge balanced square
biphasic waveforms (Banan Sadeghian et al., 2018; Khodabukus et al., 2019) or
a salt bridge to prevent pH changes to the media (Ko et al., 2018). Different
burst and frequency patterns have been shown to produce different outcomes,
such as different myosin isoforms (Naumann and Pette, 1994). Stimulation is
typically started at or after the cells have been changed from growth to
differentiation media. It is hypothesised that electrical stimulation induces
myotube formation by promoting cell growth in a PI3K-dependent manner (Ko et
al., 2018).
