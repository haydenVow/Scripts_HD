Equilibrate microcarriers in culture medium before use

  1. Prior to use, aliquotted | 6.75 | mL of sterilized microcarriers ( 20 g/L stock) suspended in dPBS into | 2  |  x | E125  | tubes/containers/flasks
  2. Rinsed microcarriers in | 6.75 | mL culture medium (50 mL/g Cytodex). (this rinse reduces dilution of the culture medium by PBS trapped between and within the microcarriers, which is particularly important when using small culture volumes or cells with low plating efficiencies).
  3. The microcarriers were then allowed to settle and as much supernatant as possible was removed.
  4. The microcarriers were resuspended to the desired volume of culture medium ( | 30 | mL ). in each culture vessel.
  5. The culture vessel was transferred to the incubator for at least 1 hour or overnight so that the microcarriers and culture medium could equilibrate. |   11:05   am/pm | 
    * 37 degrees, 5% CO2, Incubator #  | 67  |

### Process:

1\. Took image of vessel with microscope on phase setting.

2\. Aliquotted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then
placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath for a minimum of 20 minutes
prior to use:

  1. TrypLE:     60    mL in     2x 50 mL    tubes
  2.  dPBS (for washing and neutralising):     120   mL in    2x 70mL    pots
  3. Growth media (for pellet resuspension):     6   mL in     2x 15 mL    tubes
  4. Growth media for the dif assay:      6   mL in     2x 15 mL    tubes  

  5. Growth media (for seeding): See equilibration of flasks above.   

Time that all aliquots were placed in the water bath the warm before use
16:47

Note: if aliquots were placed in water bath at different time, record the time
stamp for each individual solution.




3\. Removed vessel(s) from the incubator   17:25     a/pm

4\. Removed media from the vessel(s).

5\. Washed the vessel(s) with dPBS (warmed).

6\. Added     10    mL tryple to each vessel/well and incubated at 37˚C.

  1. Start/Finish for TrypLE was     17:35 - 17:55 (Microcarrier) -  (Planar)  17:37 - 17:58    

7\. Neutralised with     10     dPBS and combined cell suspension into a
4x50mL tubes (planar)     tube.

8\. Centrifuged at 650 x g for 5 min.

  1. Start/Finish time for centrifugation was     18:10 - 18:15 (planar)  18:10-18:15 (microcarrier)    




9\. Aspirated the supernatant(s).

10\. Resuspended pellet(s) in     3 mL (P) 3 mL (MC)    mL     growth
media     time (planar) time (microcarrier)  

11\. Aliquoted    2 x 10uL      of resuspended cells into a microcentrifuge
tube for cell count.

12\. Performed a cell count using the haemocytometer and recorded the cell
count data in the Google Doc spreadsheet called 'Cell Count Spreadsheet' (see
link below):

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1DPzKubYxfHmWogVPihC-
SSIBtIylyrBQE5kRX5Z8NtI/edit#gid=0

  1.  Total cell number was:      X (planar) X (microcarrier)       

  2. Volume of cell suspension required for subculture was:           
  3. Cell density per vessel:    X (planar) X (microcarrier)        




## Seeding the E flasks

100k cells per ml with current microcarrier density. Should be 3 M cells per E
flask. 2.4 M to 4 M cells ok.

Cell numbers much lower than expected so seeding into E-Flasks without taking
cells for the differentiation assay.

  


Microcarrier Derived
Planar Derived


13\. For each cell resuspension (planar/microcarrier), transferred the
resuspension volume into a E125 flasks containing pre-warmed      30    mL
Growth media:

14\. Moved the flasks to shake in the bottom binder incubator in the library
lab at 120rpm      time  

  * [x]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (avian cells)




Observations/Summary:

Imaging observation: Cells originating from adherent culture flasks are much
more confluent rather than microcarrier derived cells which appear to be more
sparse.

### Results:

  * Results were;
    * []  As Usual (this is a repetitive task)
    * [ X ]  Unexpected because...
    * [ ]  Need to be further analysed
    * [ ]  Other (.......)

Lower cells than expected in general but particularly from the microcarrier
adapted cells.
