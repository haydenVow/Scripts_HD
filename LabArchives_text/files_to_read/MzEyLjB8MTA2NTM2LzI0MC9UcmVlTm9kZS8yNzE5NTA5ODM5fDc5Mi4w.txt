VitC Treatment


Experiment Plan:

  




Procedure - 100% Treatment with VitC

  1. Turn on the water bath and set to 37'C.
  2. Aliquot required growth media into a sterile container/s and add Vitamin C (aka LAA2P) [stock concentration 100mg/mL] to a working concentration of 50ug/mL in growth media i.e. 500uL per 1L of media.
  3. Place in the water bath and heat for at least 20 minutes. 
  4. Transfer flasks to the BSC, wiping with 70% EtOH. Discard media from the flask. 
  5. Replace selected flasks (Sets 4 and 5) with Treated media. Return to incubate and note the Flask ID. 

  

  




Very small cell aggregate balls have formed in some of the Thermo 10CF (7647 &
7645). None visible in the corning 10CS. When doing media change/treatment,
media was poured into a clean sterile bottle and any aggregates collected with
a 10mL strippette and put back into the flask after fresh media added.


50% Feed - Flask Control Group


Observations during initial treatment:  
Very small cell aggregate balls have formed in some of the Thermo 10CF (7647 &
7645).

24hrs after treatment:  
Aggregation and sheet formation were occuring in Thermo Flasks only. No
aggregation formation in Corning flasks. The control Thermo flask appeared to
have a few more very small aggregates forming, although not much difference to
the day before.
