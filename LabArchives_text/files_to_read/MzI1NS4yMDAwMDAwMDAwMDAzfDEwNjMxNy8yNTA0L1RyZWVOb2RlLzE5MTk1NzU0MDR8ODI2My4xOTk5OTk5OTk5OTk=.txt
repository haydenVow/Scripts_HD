Fibroblast ECM scaffolds seeded with MuSCA1-A8, B1-B8, C1-C4, D1-D4, E1-E4,
F1-F4 (See plate map above)Only half the samples for each condition were
stained with CMFDA (i.e. A1-A2, B1-B2, C1-C2 etc)  
  
Cell FreeC5-C8  
Only half the samples for each condition were stained with CMFDA (i.e. A1-A2,
B1-B2, C1-C2 etc)  
  
  
  




Process:

Before undertaking any of the staining transfer half of the samples into one
96-well plate. This plate will stained with CMFDA, imaged, then kept in
culture until the following week to be fixed and stained with MyoG.

Preparation of stock and and working solutions for CMFDA Cell Tracker

1\. Remove the CMFDA powder from the freezer (main lab) and allow it to warm
to room temperature. Each aliquot is 50 ug.

  1.  Briefly centrifuge the tube to pellet the CMFDA powder

2\. Add 50 uL high-quality, anhydrous DMSO to the powder and pipette up and
down until well suspended. This will yield a 1 mM stock solution.

  1. NOTE - Once prepared, the DMSO stock solution should be stored at -20'C in a 70 mL pot submerged in silica-gel desiccant beads for a short period for one series of experiments. 

3\. Transfer 10 uL of the 1mM CMFDA stock solution to 5 mL of prepared
DMEM/F12 PRF growth media in a light safe 15 mL falcon tube to protect it from
light. Vortex to ensure thorough mixing with the resulting solution being
approximately 2 uM CMFDA working solution.

4\. Prepare a separate    5  mL of DMEM/F12 PRF growth media.

  1.  Transfer both the CMFDA working stock solution and DMEM/F12 PRF growth media into the water bath to be pre-warmed    11:50      

5\. Aspirate the media from all the wells both cell seeded and cell free
scaffolds

6\. Add    200    uL of pre-warmed DMEM/F12 PRF growth media to the wells from
each plate as a rinse step to remove any residual serum.

7\. Aspirate the rinsing media from both plates

8\. Add     200  uL of pre-warmed CMFDA working solution to the each well in
both plate and incubate for 30 minutes at 37'C covered in foil to protect
samples from light.

  1. Start/Finish time was:   12:08 - 12:38   

  2.  If the CMFDA working solution is no longer required dispose of solution as aqueous waste as aqueous solutions of CMFDA are susceptible to hydrolysis and should be used within one day.

9\. Remove    150    uL of staining solution from each well

10\. Image all wells from both plates on the Zaber fluorescence microscope
(channel AF488 for CMFDA [Live cells]). Remember to image both sides.

11\. Transfer all the scaffolds into a new 96 well plate.

12\. Replace all wells with 200 uL fresh E6 growth media

13\. Return plate to the incubator.

Observations/Summary:

\- Either no or very little amount of cells on the scaffolds




Results:

  * Results were;
    * [x]  As Usual (this is a repetitive task)
    * [ ]  Unexpected because... no cells on scaffolds
    * [ ]  Need to be further analysed
    * [ ]  Other (.......)
