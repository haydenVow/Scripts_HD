Main purpose of the experiment: To optimise conditions for creation of
fibroblast aggregates

What we don't know (R&D): We don't know if different amounts of TGFb or
Vitamin C will have an effect on timing or quantity of the fibroblast
aggregates formed. We also don't know if shaking the flask is required for
fibroblast aggregation.

  
Hypothesis: We hypothesise that 10ng/mL TGFb + 50ug/mL vitamin C + shaking are
the optimal conditions for formation of fibroblast aggregates.

  

Experimental Plan

Day 1 - [TUESDAY] Passage 1 x T175 of Fibroblast cells to multiple T75s (seed
at 7k cells per cm2)

Day 4 - [FRIDAY] 50% Feed Fibroblast cells (or passage if cells are already
over-confluent)

Day 7 - [MONDAY] 100% feed with media containing various amounts of Vitamin C
(aka ascorbic acid) and various amounts of TGFb. Place some T75s on a shaker
as indicated in the experimental layout (below). The shaker should be set at
100rpm.

Day 8 - [TUESDAY] Monitor Fibroblasts for aggregates. Image if present.

Day 9 - [WEDNESDAY] Monitor Fibroblasts for aggregates. Image if present.

Monitor flasks until the end of the week (Friday). Based on these results,
make a decision about what conditions to deploy into production. If desired by
the production team for Project Artemis, harvest and weigh the pellets.

  
Experimental Layout:

Thursday Conditions: (100% confluent)

1) 50ug/mL Vit C + 10ng/mL TGFb on a shaker platform for 1-2 hours.

  

Wednesday Conditions: (100% confluent)

1) 50ug/mL Vit C + 10ng/mL TGFb on at static rest.

3) 50ug/mL Vit C + 0ng/mL TGFb at static rest.

4)  0ug/mL Vit C + 10ng/mL TGFb at static rest.

6) 100ug/mL Vit C, 20ng/mL TGFb at static rest.

  

Monday Conditions (90% confluent)

1\. 100ug/mL Vit C, 20ng/mL TGFb at static rest.

2. 50ug/mL Vit C + 10ng/mL TGFb at static rest.
