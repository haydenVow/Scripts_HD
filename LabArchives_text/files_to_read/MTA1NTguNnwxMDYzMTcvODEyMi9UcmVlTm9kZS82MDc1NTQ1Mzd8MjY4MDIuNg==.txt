Process:

  1. All cultures were examined under the microscope and observations were recorded in the table below. It was not possible to take images of the cultures as the microscope in Melbourne lab is not equipped with a camera. 
  2. No cells were observed in either the HORNY1 nor HORNY3 cultures, and these were therefore discarded. 
  3. Aliquoted   25mL  mL of  each media into seperate urine jars and warmed in the cell culture incubator for 40+ minutes
  4. Removed  12mL/ 100% of media from each vessel. 
  5. Replaced with  12mL (per well/per vessel) 
  6. Returned vessel to incubate

  * [x ]  37ÂºC, 5% CO2
  * Binder Incubator, Melbourne lab (Albert St)




### Observations/Summary:

100 % media changed on all T75 flasks.
