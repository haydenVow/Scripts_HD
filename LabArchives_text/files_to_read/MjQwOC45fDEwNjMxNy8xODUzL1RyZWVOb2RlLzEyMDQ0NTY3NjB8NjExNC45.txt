Growth Media:

  * [ ]  DMEM/F12 + 20% FBS + 1X P/S




### Process:

1\. Took image of vessel with microscope on phase setting.

2\. Aliquotted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then
placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath for a minimum of 20 minutes
prior to use:

  1. TrypLE:     10    mL in     1    tubes
  2.  dPBS (for washing and neutralising):     20    mL in   1     tubes
  3. Growth media (for pellet resuspension):    6     mL in     1    tubes
  4. Growth media (for seeding):    600     mL in    1     tubes

Time that all aliquots were placed in the water bath the warm before use
13:39 pm

Note: if aliquots were placed in water bath at different time, record the time
stamp for each individual solution.




4\. Removed vessel(s) from the incubator     13:59 pm

5\. Washed the vessel(s) with dPBS (warmed).

6\. Added      10   mL tryple to the flask and incubated at 37˚C.

  1. Start/Finish for TrypLE was   14:00 pm 

7\. Neutralised with     10mL    dPBS and combined cell suspension into a
50mL    tube.

8\. Centrifuged at 650 x g for 5 min.

  1. Start/Finish time for centrifugation was   14:14 pm 




9\. Aspirated the supernatant(s).

10\. Resuspended pellet(s) in      6   mL      Growth    media     :  pm

11\. Aliquoted     10uL     of resuspended cells into a microcentrifuge tube
for cell count.

12\. Performed a cell count using the haemocytometer and recorded the cell
count data in the Google Doc spreadsheet called 'Cell Count Spreadsheet' (see
link below):

SSIBtIylyrBQE5kRX5Z8NtI/edit#gid=0

  1.  Total cell number was:       11,088,000    
  2. Volume of cell suspension required for subculture was:       all      

  3. Cell density per vessel:     7,000 cells / cm2      




13\. Transferred     6mL      µl of cell suspension to the pre-warmed      300
mL Growth media:    14 :40   pm

14\. Transferred cell suspension into the     2CF       vessel.

  

16\. Transferred vessel(s) to incubate at: 14:43

  * [ ]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (avian cells)

### Results:

  * Results were;
    * [ X ]  As Usual (this is a repetitive task)
    * [ ]  Unexpected because...
    * [ ]  Need to be further analysed
