### Process:

1\. Fillled 9x 96 well plates with 300uL of dPBS and 200uL of tryple as per
the plate (dPBS in columns 1-6, Rows A, C, E, G. Tryple in Columns 7-12, Rows
B, D, F, H) Filled another three separate plates with growth media (DMEM/F12+
20% FBS + 1xP/S), 200uL per well, all wells.  

2\. Generated a multiwell open protocol using the 'Dynamo' script using the 1
well passaging protocol attached and the pick lists generated on the 8/6/22.

3\. Pick lists for all remaining cultures in this experiment can be found in
the following sheets document.
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1yQD_JrhzktpQd0vaCt2B5OskKgl9SipLLab3WZ9v7ZU/edit#gid=388061351

  * PRKCD+CDKN2B and NFKB1A+CDKN2B clones will be passaged to the same new 96 well plate
  * PLA2R+CDKN2B and CDKN2B clones will be passaged to the same 96 well plate. 
  * Control clones will be passaged to a new 96 well plate. 

3\. Set up the opentron deck as per the layout at the top of the page for each
passage. Three opentron runs were preformed using the attached protocols at
the bottom of this entry. Tryple and dPBS plates were added to opentron deck
heaters to warm to 37 degrees for 8 minute prior to starting each protocol.

6\. Allowed the protocol to run to completion. (tryple time per well was 20
minutes, with tryple prewarmed to 37 degrees using deck heaters before it was
added to cells. Summaries of the passages can be found in the sheets document
above for each run.

7\. Transferred the new cultures to incubate at 30 degrees, 5% CO2 incubator
#140.

  




Observations/Summary:

Observed the wells after passage all wells contained cells.

The PLA2R+CDKN2B and CDKN2B clones were picked on the 15/6/2022.
