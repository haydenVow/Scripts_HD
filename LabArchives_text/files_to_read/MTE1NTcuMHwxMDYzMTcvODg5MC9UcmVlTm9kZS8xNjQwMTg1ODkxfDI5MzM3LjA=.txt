StepInspect TCU  
Operator nameVP  
Time-stamp09:44  
Protocol

  1. Ensure TCU (temperature control unit) is connected to power supply
  2. Turn TCU on at power switch on the unit and set to 0°C
  3. TCU will need at least 40 minutes to come to temperature before able to be used. Necessary to cool headplate controlling agitation (RPM) of vessels. Do not engage vessels with stirring before temperature has been reached

StepInspect physical gas line connections  
Operator nameVP  
Time-stamp09:45  
Protocol

  1. check gas line connections to the hardware. The AMBR hardware supports 3 gas inputs in the following order from left-to-right:
    1. CO2
    2. Compressed air or N2
    3. O2
  2. Mammalian settings will always used compressed air and not N2. Ensure this is physically connected at the gas regulator
  3. Inspect the regulator switch. Ensure the handle is running parallel to the line (open) and not perpendicular to the line (closed)
  4. Inspect the pressure of the regulators. The regulators should be between 1-3 bar in pressure for proper functionality. Ensure all regulators are set to the same pressure

StepSet process parameters and flow  
Operator nameVP  
Time-stamp09:48  
Protocol

  1. Open Vow_1 protocol in processes tab at the bottom of the screen
  2. Adjust parameters as necessary
    * set stirring speed for each vessel
      * Select the 'Process' tab -> 'Vow 1' -> locate the 'Conditioning and Calibration' tab -> select 'Stir speed on' step / phase -> click 'Edit' -> select the RPMs that are being tested

      * Under the 'Set point' enter desired RPMs

    * control loops turn on or off (antifoam, dissolved oxygen, pH (CO2 gassing), pH (base)
      1. Go to 'Process' -> 'Vow 1' -> 'Control loops' -> Edit 'pH lower' and 'pH upper'; from this menu, the CO2 gas flow rate can also be changed by editing the 'Maximum (mL / min)' - can be used to alter the rate at which the pH changes
      2. Delete anti-foam control loop (anti-foam will dose at entire vessel volume when feed added)
      3. Delete dO control loop (unless required for the run)
    * set reservoir details and pumps
      1. Select 'Process' -> 'Vow 1' -> 'Pumps A-E'
      2. Assign the role of 'Pump A' as the feed (consisting of 3:1 R:H + GFs + antifoam)
      3. Assign the role of 'Pump B' as the base (1M sodium bicarbonate)
      4. Ensure the remainder of the pumps are marked as 'Not used'
    * media batch volume and total vessel volume after inoculation
      1. Edit the volumes of the batch by selecting 'Vow 1' -> 'Volumes' -> 'Batch media' in the 'Components' table -> change the volume to 190 mL
    * feed and sampling schedules
      1. Select 'Process' and explore around the screen to locate the 'Steps on days within phase' table and change the sample volume to 2 mL (1 mL x 2; once to purge the line and another to take the sample)
      2. Delete any 'Calculated antifoam bolus' steps (as the AF was added to the feed media

Suggestions/notes:

  * you cannot adjust pH set-point at this time before pH has been calibrated with spot patch and offset calculation
  * once a phase has started or has been completed it cannot be edited. Instead, copy the phase and paste after the phase currently in progress
  * to re-run a phase (e.g. the temp didn't reach set point within the specified wait time) can re-attempt the phase by clicking on 'Failed bioreactors' -> then press 'Retry'. Can also manually copy and paste the phase into the workflow in process tab
  * For any step that takes too long, the wait time can be changed by going to 'Process' -> selecting the relevant step in the 'Conditioning and calibration' table (e.g. 'Check for pH drift') -> 'Edit' -> 'Timing' -> select 'Maximum wait time' (e.g. 2m, 5m) -> 'OK'
