## 1\. Background

Epidermal Growth Factor (EGF) is a potent growth factor that plays an
important role in the regulation of cell growth, proliferation and
differentiation. It stimulates the proliferation of various epidermal and
epithelial cells.

## 3\. Safety

The preparation of EGF aliquots is to be performed in a Biological Safety
Cabinet. General lab PPE is required, including face mask, hair net, gloves,
and lab coat.

## 5\. Consumables/Reagents Required

  1. Sterile dPBS
  2. EGF stock powder
  3. 2 x Falcon tubes
  4. 1 x Syringe filter unit
  5. Sterile microtubes 




## 8\. Method/Procedure (suitable for Mesokine CAT# MK0100)

Note: Please perform this procedure with the BSC light turned off. Growth
factors are often sensitive to light exposure.  

  1. Calculate the volume of dPBS required to create a 0.1 mg/mL stock solution.
  2. Using a serological pipette, transfer the required amount of dPBS into a sterile falcon tube in the Biological Safety Cabinet (BSC).  
  3. Retrieve stock powder from storage location (EGF stock is kept at -20 degrees C).
  4. Centrifuge the vial containing EGF powder for 30 seconds and then transfer the vial to the BSC.
  5. Using a micropipette, transfer dPBS from the falcon tube to the stock vial to reconstitute the powder to a concentration of 1.0 mg/mL. Pipette mix thoroughly and smoothly to dissolve the stock powder, taking care not to spill any of the solution. 
  6. Transfer the entire aliquot back to the falcon tube of dPBS. Repeat steps 5 - 6 twice more to ensure that the entire amount of powder is dissolved in the dPBS. 
  7. Check the vial to ensure there is no powder left. If any powder remains, repeat steps 5 - 6 until the vial is clean.
  8. Using a serological pipette, carefully mix the solution to ensure a homogenous mix (do not vortex!). 
  9. Pour or pipette solution into a syringe filter unit and filter into a new sterile falcon tube.
  10. Transfer the solution into sterile microtubes. Remember to add at least 5 uL to your desired aliquot volume to account for loss of liquid from pipetting. 
  11. Enter details in Stockyard V2 under "Create Mix".
  12. Place aliquots into an appropriately sized container (e.g. cryobox, 500 mL sterile pot) and stick Stockyard label on the container. Add a note of the volume per aliquot for future users. 
  13. Store in - 20 degrees C freezer.
