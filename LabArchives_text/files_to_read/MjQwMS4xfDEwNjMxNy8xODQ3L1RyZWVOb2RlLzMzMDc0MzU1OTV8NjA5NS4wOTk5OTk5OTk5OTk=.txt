Observations:

\- Some of the Vit C/TGF-B conditions had begun to peel off the culture flask
surface, characteristic of the sheet formation previously seen with
fibroblasts. Unclear if they will remain adhered to the growth surface for the
remainder of the culturing process (~1 week).

\- Approximately 1/3 of Sample 1.8 (collagen seeded cells) has detached off
the growth surface and can no longer adhere. Need to be extremely careful when
doing the feeds to not detach it completely.

\- Vit C/TGF-B treated conditions appear more confluent than non-treated
conditions.
