Process:

1\. Aliquotted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then
placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath for a minimum of 20 minutes
prior to use:

  1. TrypLE:    70   mL in   2x 50 mL    tubes
  2. dPBS (for neutralising and washing)    140  mL in    1    tubes
  3. Growth media (for pellet resuspension):    20  mL in    50mL  tube
  4. Growth media (for seeding):   500   mL in    1x 500mL pot 
  5. Times that all aliquots were placed in the water bath to warm before use  15:45-16:05
  6. NOTE: More cells were retrieved than expected, additional 235mL media was warmed 17:45-18:00

Note: if aliquots were placed in water bath at different times, record the
time stamp for each individual solution.




2\. Washed the flask(s) with dPBS.

3\. Added    10   mL tryple to each vessel/well and incubated at 37˚C for
16   min.

Note: Fibroblasts typically require 15-18 minutes of incubation with tryple,
slightly longer than MuSCs.

  1. Start/Finish time for tryple was  16:25  \-   16:41

4\. Neutralised with    10 mL   dPBS (warmed) and combined cell suspension
into a    4x 50 mL   tube.

5\. Centrifuged at 650 x g for 5 min

  1. Start/Finish time for centrifugation was    \-  16-55-17:00




6\. Aspirated the supernatant(s)

7\. Resuspended pellet(s) in      20 mL    Growth   media.

8\. Performed a cell count using the haemocytometer and recorded the cell
count data in the Google Doc spreadsheet called 'Cell Count Spreadsheet' (see
link below):

SSIBtIylyrBQE5kRX5Z8NtI/edit#gid=0

9\. Total cell number was:    61M  




10\. Seeded ~7k cells per cm2 of the flasks/plates. Note that fibroblasts
prefer to be subcultured closely together.

11\. Volume of cell suspension required for subculture was:   7.3mL for 5CS
and 0.172mL for each T75  

12\. Transfer 7.3mL cell suspension to the pre-warmed  700 mL Growth Media for
5SC and Transfer 0.516mL cell suspension to the pre-warmed  36 mL Growth Media
for 5SC.

13\. Transfer cell suspension into (non-gelatin coated) flasks.

14\. Transfer flask/plate(s) to incubate at: 18:10

  * [x]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
