Process
  
  
  1. Took 1 x 560 uL aliquot from each E250 and E500 and performed counts on ViCell
  2. Recorded counts in media results spreadsheet: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1cnmEz5amKSGmA9u3BJ-Dn0w-I7zFobBr6pG-UWCYaXM/edit#gid=595130609
  3. Prepared 400 mL of 50/50 RPMI/CHO medium + IGF + EGF 
    1. Added 7.9 mL and 4 mL of L-glutamine and glucose solutions respectively
  4. Prepared 200 mL of 75/25 RPMI/CHO medium + IGF + EGF 
    1. Added 3.2 mL and 3 mL of L-glutamine and glucose solutions respectively
  5. Placed in waterbath 
  6. Combined 50/50 cell suspensions then divided equally between 2 x E1000s
  7. Combined 75/25 cell suspensions then divided equally between 2 x E500s
  8. Added 200 mL 50/50 medium to each E1000 (total 300 mL per flask)
  9. Added 100 mL 75/25 medium to each E500 (total 200 mL per flask)
  10. Replaced flasks in incubator (110 RPM, 37'C, 5% CO2)
