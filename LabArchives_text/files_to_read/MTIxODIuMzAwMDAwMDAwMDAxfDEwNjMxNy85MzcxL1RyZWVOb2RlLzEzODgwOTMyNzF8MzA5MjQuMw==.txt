Aim: to verify the performance of DSD condition 14 and iterate on the formulation to further increase maximum density
Hypothesis: That condition 14 will again support cell densities of >3M cells/mL, and optimisation of the formulation will support cell densities of >4M cells/mL

Is this a continuation of a previous experiment/series of work?  YLink to DSD
experiment  
We performed a DSD screening 6 ingredients to add to our Nuvonis formulation
with the aim of increasing the maximum cell density that the medium can
support. Condition 14 was our best performer, with 2/3 of the replicates
reaching =/> 3.3M cells/mL, which is the highest we've seen yet in any of our
50:50 RPMI:CHO Nuvonis media iterations. We need to repeat this condition to
verify this result. We also need to further optimise the formulation to see if
we can achieve higher densities yet, as our overarching goal is 7.5M cells/mL.

Why? Including a background section provides justification for why certain
research choices were made and prompts you to ensure that this is an
appropriate research direction i.e. one which will likely assist us in
reaching our goals. This is important to the reader/reviewer as well as to
project leads and ultimately investors, ensuring that our time, money and
energy is being put to good use.

Total number of cells needed

*See the following page on statistics, specifically the power calculations section to determine appropriate number of replicates  
*number does not include vessels required for cell expansion prior to testing variables  
**will the results retrieved be quantitative (data that can be
counted/measured using numbers and can be used to calculate significance) or
qualitative (cannot be counted/measured/expressed easily using numbers,
results are more observational and open to interpretation)  
  
Why? The tabulated information above represents the critical information
required to repeat the experiment and interpret the findings. Thus, it is
important that it is documented clearly for reproducibility purposes. Note -
it is preferred that experiments generate quantitative data with enough
replicates to calculate significance, if the experiment only results in
qualitative findings please take time to reassess the experimental plan, can a
quantitative method be used? will qualitative findings be sufficient to decide
whether the outcomes are successful or not? how can you limit bias and error
in recording these findings?

Reviewer Comments:

[VP] seeking clarification re "Seed @ 500K/mL: 270M cells + error = 285M
cells" are we seeding at 500K or 285? Where has this error been calculated?

[LL] So firstly I was basing this on 18 flasks when we actually need 21, so
have updated calculation. We need 315M cells total to seed 21 x E-125s at 500K
cells/mL in 30 mL of medium. I like to simplify things for myself and always
add 1 mL of cell suspension to each E-125 when seeding. This means we need the
cell concentration of our cell stock to be 15M cells/mL, because 15M cells
added to 30 mL = 500K cells/mL. I then like to have 1 mL of buffer/error so we
don't run out of cell suspension when seeding, so I always add one extra flask
worth of cells to the calculation, i.e. 15M extra cells. So that makes it 330M
cells total, which we will re-suspend in 22 mL for a 15M cells/mL cell
suspension.  
  
[VP] thanks makes sense

  1. Prepare control 1: 95 mL of HyCell CHO Nuvonis medium with growth factors (0.00005 mg/mL IGF + 0.00001 mg/mL EGF)
  2. Prepare base medium: make 600 mL of R&D 50:50 RPMI:CHO Nuvonis medium without growth factors. Add 95 mL of the base medium to each of 6 x 120 mL pots.
  3. Prepare control 2: Added growth factors (0.00005 mg/mL IGF + 0.00001 mg/mL EGF) to 1 x 95 mL aliquot
  4. Prepare control 3: Added factors for condition 14 as specified in spreadsheet to 1 x 95 mL aliquot
  5. Prepare conditions 14.1-14.4 according to spreadsheet linked in "Notes" column with remaining 4 x 95 mL aliquots 
  6. Aliquoted 1 mL of each media condition into 7 x 1.5 mL eppendorf tubes for biochem analysis and stored in freezer at -20'C
  7. Placed all 95 mL media aliquots in fridge 

Spreadsheet with condition calculations[VP] overall - we should aim to collect
and store some spent media samples at critical time points. e.g. Day 0
(unspent), Day 3, Day 5, Day 6/7 (final day). We can analyse with biochem
analyser in house for fast TAT of basic and informative results  
[LL] thanks for the reminder Vic! Forgot to include that. Will update now.

  1. Split 90 mL of each media condition between 3 x E125s (30 mL per E-125, total of 21 x E-125s)
  2. Place E-125s in incubator to equilibrate and warm media
  3. Perform count on continuous culture being used to seed experiment 
  4. Aliquot X mL of cell suspension containing 330M cells 
  5. Centrifuge cell suspension at 500 x g for 5 min 
  6. Aspirate 100% of supernatant 
  7. Re-suspend cells evenly in 22 mL of base medium (15M cells/mL)
  8. Move E-125s from incubator to BSC
  9. Add 1 mL of cell suspension to each E-125
  10. Take 1 x 50 uL sample from each seeded E-125 and perform count on the Cellaca to get day 0 count
  11. Move E-125s back to incubate at 37'C, 120 RPM

Note for reviewer: I added a Day 0 count given it won't add much time or extra
labour - I figure given the uncertainty around what happened with day 1 counts
from the high seeding density experiment it might be a good idea to know what
the actual seeding density is on day 0 and confirm we are seeding at the
density we think we are seeding at [VP] agreed re time 0 count  
[LL] kept in plan  
  
[AV] From Slack: Is there any reason why there's 7 conditions in triplicates
but only 18 flasks being used / seeded?  
[LL] I've worded it poorly so it isn't clear - 6 conditions are with R&D basal
medium, and 1 is HyCell, so 18 flasks with R&D basal medium and 3 with HyCell
basal medium. Have clarified wording. I think the cell requirements are also
based on the 18 flasks so will re-do calculations

Will only perform cell count on day 7 if cells are still growing/peak density
has not yet clearly been reached  
  
  
Why? Clear and easy to follow thus minimising chance of error
