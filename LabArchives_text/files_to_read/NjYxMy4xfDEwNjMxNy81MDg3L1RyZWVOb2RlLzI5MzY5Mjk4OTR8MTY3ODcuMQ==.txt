### Observations/Summary:

F_DOLLY12 cells were grown in 3 different types of E8_9C cells, each with a
different type of recombinant human albumin (r_HA).They included:

2x T25 flasks with E8_9C media + r_HA (from richcore, using an old batch)  
2x T25 flasks with E8_9C media + r_HA (from RIchcore, using an new batch but
with the same catalogue number as the old batch)  
2x T25 flasks with E8_9C media + r_HA (from Sigma)  
  
These 3 ACF treated groups were compared against 2x (T25 flasks) controls
grown in D/F+10%FBS+1XP/S  
  
All 3 ACF treated groups appeared to detach from the surface of the T25 flask.
In comparison, the control cohort (grown in D/F_10%FBS+1XP/S) appeared to
still be adhered to the flask.  
  
We observed similar findings were observed in trial 1 of this experiment but
the extensive cell death and detachment from the flask surface was observed on
day 5 (rather than day 7 for this trial). The main difference between trial 1
and 2 is the use of E8_9C. Without the glyoxylic acid, they appeared to last
1-2 days longer than trial 1(which used E8_10C medium).  
  
  
Further optimisation of the E8_10C media is needed to be compatible for
fibroblast growth and proliferation.
