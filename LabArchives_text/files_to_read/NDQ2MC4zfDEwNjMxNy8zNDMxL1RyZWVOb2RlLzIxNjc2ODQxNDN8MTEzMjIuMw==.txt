Primary Staining


Reagent preparation:

Use the following spreadsheet to:

  * Determine the total amount of regent required for primary staining
  * Provide more information on antibody types

1\. Prepared    12mL  PBST (0.2% Triton-X)

2\. Prepared    12mL  blocking buffer: PBST (0.1% Triton-X + PBS) + 3% bovine
serum albumin (BSA). (Kept in the fridge until needed in blocking step)

3\. Prepared Primary Antibody Mix: :  140 µL   Primary #1 MyoG (Santa Cruz)
(1:200  ) +   35 µL   Primary #2 MF20 (DSHB)   (1:50  ) +  7  mL Blocking
Buffer

Pipette-mixed antibody mix and stored refrigerated away from light until
needed.   9:30

Blocking ( ~ 1 hr)

1\. Added  1 mL of blocking buffer (3% BSA in PBST [0.1% Triton-X]) and
incubate for 45 minutes - 1hr at RT. (no more than 1 hour):   11:05 -  




Single/Simultaneous Primary Antibody staining ( ~ 10 minutes or 2hr)

1\. Removed blocking buffer from each well.   12:10  
  
Placed antibody in pbs instead of blocking buffer. Put on cells and removed
immediately once realising the mistake.  
  

2\. Incubated cells with primary antibody for 90min - 2hrs at RT, or 4ºC
overnight:   12:22 - 14:50  

3\. Parafilmed plates and stored at 4ºC in tissue culture lab Fridge.

After this step, all further task should be performed in a dark room. The
vessel should also be wrapped foil when not used.


Secondary Staining


Reagent preparation:

1\. Aliquotted    100 mL  PBS for washing

2\. Centrifuged the secondary antibody stock using the benchtop
microcentrifuge for 10 seconds.

3\. Prepared Secondary Antibody mix (pipette from the top/supernatant of
antibody solution):

  7 µL   Secondary #1   (1:1000  ) +   7 µL   Secondary #2   (1:1000  ) +   7
mL Blocking Buffer (PBST (0.1% Triton X + dPBS) + 3% BSA)  

If using AlexaFluor secondary antibodies then the max concentration should be
1:500 (typically used at 1:1000)

Pipette-mixed antibody mix and stored refrigerated away from light until
needed.

 ~~4\. Prepared DAPI mix:  ~~

 ~~   14 mL  PBS +    14 uL  of DAPI~~

 ~~ ~~Vortexed DAPI mix and stored refrigerated away from light until
needed.~~~~




Process:

1\. Removed plate from fridge (incubated in primary antibodies overnight).

2\. Washed 3 times for 5 min with PBS at RT.

 14:50 - 14:57

 15:00 - 15:05

 15:05 - 15:10

3\. Incubated the cells with secondary antibody mixture in the dark at RT for
1 hour.  15:08 - 16:22

NOTE: from this step onwards protect from the light by wrapping plates in foil
and perform experiment in the dark.
