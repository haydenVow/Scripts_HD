Having a range of clonal myogenic stem cells that proliferate fast (and
practically without end) is a core component of the tech platform required for
Vow's mission. The high-performing DOLLY12_11E7 clone has already been
expanded on microcarriers and banked at WCB2 stage, ready for use in
downstream processes.

We have learnt from this process and are now ready to apply those learnings to
expansion of the DAISY4_16G9. Obtained from the following experiment

DAISY4-Cells-1-31ac18338fa840ba95bc16c7e5663c7e

What we learnt:

Day  
DescriptionWhy  
0Monday/TuesdayThaw into T-flasksTo be able to inspect the success of the thaw  
3 or 4FridayPassage 25% into planar cultureware, 75% into microcarrier culture
and residue into at least 2 diff assay plates

Expansion in microcarriers is much slower after initial passage into
microcarrier culture (due to loss of cells during proliferation and
harvesting) compared to planar culture. Therefore, it is important to seed 2-3
times as many cells into microcarrier culture as for planar culture. It is
also important to test differentiation and fusion  
  
7MondayPassage into larger vessels

Unfit cells begin to drop off microcarriers after 4 days or so, the
microcarrier expansion should ideally go for longer than this. Therefore, it
is important to expand the cells over an additional passage.  
  
10 or 11Thursday/FridayHarvest and bank cellsIdeally half from planar
cultureware and half from microcarrier culture.
