Process:

  1. Cell count from Culture 12588 was 3.26 million cells/mL
  2. Aliquotted 18.4mL of cell suspension into a new 50mL falcon tube (60 million cells).
  3. Centrifuged cells for 5 minutes at 500g.
  4. Resuspended cells in 88mL of DMEM/F12 + Albumin (18.75 mg/mL) + 1X ITS + Vit C (150 ng/mL) + 1X P/S.
  5. Aliquotted 300uL of cell suspension in each well of 6 x 48 well plates.
  6. Transferred to 37C, 5%CO2




Observations/Summary:

60 million cells obtained from cell supply and seeded into 6 x 48 well plates
at 20,000 cell per well.
