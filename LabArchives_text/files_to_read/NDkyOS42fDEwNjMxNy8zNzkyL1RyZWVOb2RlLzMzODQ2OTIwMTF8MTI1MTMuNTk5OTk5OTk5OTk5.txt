In order to produce cultured meat at a large scale and in a reproducible
manner, an immortalised cell line is necessary. To generate this, we have used
the process of single cell cloning. This involves collecting a heterogeneous
populations of cells and isolating single cells from one another to determine
whether any populations that grow may have a mutation that allows
prolonged/unlimited cell doublings. Isolating single cells from one another
also allows us to generate homogenous populations of cells, verifying that
they all originated from 1 parent cell. This reduces variability of results
when the cells are to be used in subsequent experiments.

Previously, we have tried adapting a heterogenous population of cells to
suspension. To see a summary of the experiments performed so far and key
findings, click here. We have not tried performing suspension adaption using
clones before. In this experiment, we will use a MuSC clone (DOLLY12_11E7)
generated from EPIC13644 and a fibroblast clone (F_DOLLY12_4C4) generated from
EPIC20859.
