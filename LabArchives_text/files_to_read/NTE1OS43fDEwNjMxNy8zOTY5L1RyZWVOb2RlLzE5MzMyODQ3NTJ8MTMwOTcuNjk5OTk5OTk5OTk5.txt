RELATED TO MILESTONE: KR2: Generate at least 1 suspension-adapted fibroblast
cell line which is >95% viable and proliferates for >14 days

AIM/PURPOSE: To successfully adapt DOLLY12 fibroblasts to ACF-media with KSR
in planar culture before adapting them to suspension culture

HYPOTHESIS: The DOLLY12 fibroblasts in KSR medium will initially decline in
viability and number, and then will begin proliferating once adapted to ACF-
medium. The same will happen when they are moved to suspension culture.
