T259713-WALLE06-Bennets Wallaby P3-1of3  
9714-WALLE06-Bennets Wallaby P3-2of3  
Healthy with typical fibroblast morphology (elongated, spindle shaped).
Visible cell debris and rounded-up and floating cells.

T759715-WALLE06-Bennets Wallaby P3-3of3  
Healthy with typical fibroblast morphology (elongated, spindle shaped).
Visible cell debris and rounded-up and floating cells.

T759711-WALLE07-Bennets Wallaby P3-1of2  
9712-WALLE07-Bennets Wallaby P3-2of2  
For both cultures, some typical fibroblast morphology (spindle shaped).
However, predominant population are likely senescent cells with enlarged
nuclei and cytoplasm and rounder/triangular cell morphology. Around 40%
confluent

6- well plate9716-WALLE09-Bennets Wallaby P3-1of1  
Small number of typical, spindle shaped fibroblast cells. Large number of
rounded up cells. Some are very clearly apoptotic with granulated cytoplasm
whereas others appear to be actively dividing. Rounded cells also seem to
"bounce" around as if they are in a matrix, rather than free flowing as
expected although likely to be due to small volume and capacity of 6 well
plate.

Process

  1. Placed  mL of growth media in the water bath at 37C timestamp  
  

  2. Culture vessels removed from the incubator timestamp 12:55 for imaging, 14:20 for feed  
  

  3. Each vessel was examined under the microscope and imaged at 10x and 20x magnifications. Observations were recorded in the table bellow  
  

  4. Removed 50% of the media from each well.  For culture 9716, rather than discarding media, 750 uL of supernatant was transferred to well E1 for observation.  
  
  

  5. Replaced with pre-warmed growth media. Transferred 750 uL of fresh media to E1 of culture 9716.  
  

  6. Culture vessels returned to library lab incubator 77, 37C and 5% CO2  timestamp 14:34
