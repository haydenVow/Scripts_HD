Plating of zein samples for Hoechst seeding experiment.

1\. Zein pieces (covered in DMEM/F12 and stored in petri dishes on 13/04/21)
were removed from the biomaterials fridge.

2\. N= 12 samples were transferred to untreated 96 well plates as follows  
\- Plate 1: N=4 samples to be seeded with suspension seeded. + N=4 samples to
be left to dry for 4-5 hours, without mechanical disruption.  
\- Plate 2: N= 4 samples to be seeded with concentrated cell solution, on both
sides of the scaffold.

3\. Approx. 150ul of media was aspirated from the Petri dish and placed in
each scaffold containing well of the 96 well plates.

4\. Plates were then sealed with parafilm and returned to the biomaterials
fridge overnight.

1\. The Zein pieces in 96 well plates (stored in the biomaterials fridge on
14/04/21) were transferred from the fridge to the BSC.

2\. All media was removed from the wells.

3\. Four more zein pieces (covered in DMEM/F12 and stored in petri dishes on
13/04/12) were removed from the biomaterials fridge. Two pieces were added to
the two plates and covered with 150ul of media from the petri dish.

4\. The zein pieces were left to dry with the plate lids ajar in the BSC.

Since the samples were not drying fast enough, the lids were completely
removed from the plates. 13:00
