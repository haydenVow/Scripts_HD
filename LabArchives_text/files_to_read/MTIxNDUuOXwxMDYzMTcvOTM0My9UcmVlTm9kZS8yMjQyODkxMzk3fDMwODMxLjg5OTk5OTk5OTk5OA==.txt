E-125  
Note: These cultures are also being used as controls in experiment 830. In
that experiment they are labelled 13380, 13381 & 13382\. They will be sampled
twice when counting for this experiment, but labelled as two different
cultures when running the Cellaca protocol.

  1. Transferred all vessels to BSC 
  2. For E-125s:
    1. Took 2 x 50 uL sample from each flask (each flask needs two samples as these are acting as controls for experiments 828 and 830. They will be labelled by their culture ID for each experiment when running the counts on the Cellaca e.g. take two samples from culture 13392, and when you load it onto the Cellaca label one sample as 13392 and one sample as 13380 so they get uploaded into the Ranger data for both experiments) 
    2. Pipetted each sample into 1 x well of Cellaca counting plate
  3. For 50 mL bioreactor tubes:
    1. Took 1 x 50 uL sample from each tube
    2. Pipetted each sample into 1 x well of Cellaca counting plate
  4. For 96-well plates:
    1. Took 1 x 50 uL sample from 3 x randomly selected wells 
    2. Pipetted each sample into 1 x well of Cellaca counting plate 
    3. Replaced with 50 uL of sterile dPBS 
    4. Marked with an "X" on 96-well plate lid which wells were sampled from to indicate the sacrifice
  5. Replaced cultures in incubators 
  6. Prepared Cellaca counting plate and ran count
