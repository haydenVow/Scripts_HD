Took samples

  1. Unscrewed the "BENCHMARK" sample tube cover.
  2. Sprayed down the tube end with 70% ethanol.
  3. Connected a 5 mL sterile syringe.
  4. Withdrew slightly more than 3 mL (to purge the line).
  5. Discarded the 5 mL syringe.
  6. Connected a fresh sterile syringe and withdrew sample 4 mL.
  7. Disconnected sample syringe and transferred sample to vessel(s) for subsequent analysis.
    1. 3 x 1 mL aliquots in 3x 1.5 mL Eppendorf tubes
  8. Sprayed sample tube end and cap with 70% ethanol, re-attached cap.

Stained and imaged cells adhered to microcarriers

  1. Added 1 drop of Hoechst 33342 readyprobes reagent to each tube
  2. Vortexed at minimum power for 30 seconds
  3. Left the tubes to incubate at room temperature, in the dark (away from light), for 15 minutes.  `| 11:30 - 11:45 |`
  4. `Added 3 x 80 uL of dPBS to 3` x wells of a 96 well plate
  5. `After incubation, transferred 20 uL from each tube to a well containing 80 uL of dPBS `
  6. The wells were inspected under the Axio microscope, 5x objective.
  7. Using https://mia-capture.vow.tools/#/, 2-3 sets of same frame images using the DAPI and PHASE channels were captured for each well `| : am/pm|`
    1. Fluorescence intensity of the UV lamp was adjusted until the centre of each microcarrier was barely visible compared to the space between microcarriers.
  8. Once images were captured, Image pairs were assigned a 'location ID' in MIA capture. 
  9. Images captured were then selected for analysis using the 'uCarrier cell count plastic' tool from MIA capture. 

  




Analysis using nuclei ejection.

### Process:

Nuclei Ejection:

  1. Removed 0.85 mL of the supernatant from the 1.5mL tubes carefully without aspirating the microcarriers.

  2. Washed microcarriers using 0.85 mL of room temperature Dulbecco's phosphate buffered saline without Ca2+ and Mg2+ (DPBS-/-).
  3. Aspirated and discarded the dPBS wash. [11:59]
  4. Added 0.85 mL of cell lysis solution to the microcarriers
  5. Vortexed the 1.5 mL tube for 1 min at maximum speed to release nuclei.
  6.  ~~` ~~Added the Hoechst 33342 ready flow reagent (nuc blue) at a concentration of 20 uL/mL of culture to each sample. Already added  
~~`~~

  7.  ~~`Mixed contents using a P1000.  `~~
  8.  ~~Measured the total volume of the suspension in the 1.5 mL tubes (this volume is referred to as`V-nuclei` (600uL)~~
  9.  ~~Added 20uL/mL of Hoechst 33342 to the tube  `10uL`  Pipette to mix.~~
  10.  ~~Allowed the tube to incubate in the dark for 15 minutes at room temperature.  ~~` ~~| 16:32-16:47 |~~`
  11. Loaded 10uL of each Hoechst stained sample onto a countess slide and took three images of separate locations under the DAPI imaging channel on the Axio under the 10x objective.
  12. Took a further 1 image for each sample under the axio on the DAPi channel using the 5x objective.
  13. Put each 1.5mL tube containing the remaining ejected nuclei sample in a 50mL pot and placed in the sliver fridge in the main lab on the top shelf on the door. XXXX

Checked feed strategies

  1. Checked LEVELT pump
    1. LEVELT totalizer: 557 mL (123 mL on day 3) which is 434 mL greater than day 3
  2. Checked SUBS-A pump
    1. SUBS-A totalizer: 3659 mL (3126 mL on day 3) which is 533 mL greater than day 3
  3. This indicates that the 50% feed strategy worked
