Process:

  

  

  
  
  
Starting deck state  
  
  

Startup and calibration:

  1. Switched on HEPA filter (top of robot, switch on left) and the OT2 robot.
  2. Wiped the base/desk of the robot with 70% (v/v) EtOH. Do not wipe the sides (clear acrylic panels) with ethanol. OT2 should be treated like a BSC for maintaining sterility. Spray and wipe any items with ethanol before placing into OT2. 
  3. Connected to the robot from a lab computer by using the OpenTrons app. 
  4. Uploaded desired protocol to the app. Download the protocol file you need from Google Drive:  https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/12S3szo_L9g5Z79TkIwZo8bcm2bOdGSzG.
  5. Clicked  Proceed to calibrate. 
  6. Arranged labware and reagents on the OT2 as shown in the deck layout. 
  7. Calibrated to labware by following the instructions on the app and then ran the protocol.  

Start time:    13:15  a/pm

Summary of protocol:

  * Remove 50uL of remaining supernatant (red dye)
  * Wash 3x with 200uL of water
  * Add 100uL of red dye ("Janus Green") 
  * Incubate for 5 minutes
  * Wash 5 times with water ("PBS")
  * Add 100uL  copper sulfate ("HCl")
  * Incubate for 10 minutes.
  * Transfer 50uL of supernatant to new plate.

End time:     14:50  a/pm

  

Termination and cleaning:

  1. Once the protocol is complete, discarded tips in the yellow biowaste bin. Sprayed and wiped the trash tray with ethanol before returning it to the robot. Liquid waste should be collected in bottles, and PFA waste should be discarded into the PFA waste container. OT2 reservoirs are reusable. They should be sprayed with Viraclean if they contained cell suspensions and then washed in eucalyptus disinfectant. Then they need to be soaked in water, dried, and autoclaved.'
  2. Removed all labware from OT2 and wipe the base/deck of the OT2 with ethanol. The pipette head can also be cleaned with 70% ethanol. Wiped the sides (clear acrylic panels) with working solution of bleach (10-15%) and then dried with a RediWipe.

Optimised Protocol:


Observations/Key Learnings:

  * Gold standard for amount of PBS washes should be 5x iterations.
  * Removing 50uL of TMB was mostly unsuccesful as it would not aspirate complete amount - however this is not an issue provided there is adequate PBS washing to compensate this.
  * Blowing out was either not occuring for some removal steps or blowing out waste in "trash". Need to ensure it is implemented across all steps.
  * 4th of 8 pipettes aspirated some air. Needs monitoring on subsequent runs.
  * 5 PBS washes is the sweet spot for removing red dye colour.
  * Protocol might benefit from being split into two.
  * Gravimetric analysis showed that each well contained supposedly 40uL in the end. However, the density of Allura Red is different to water and hence 1 g/cm3 density cannot be assumed here.
