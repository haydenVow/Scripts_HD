Background and Aims
  
  
Background

The Mini-tissues stream is analysing cell viability in tissue-engineered
tissue constructs using flow cytometry for highly reproducible and accurate
quantitation of cell viability. However, when analysing Experiment 4, there
were a number of issues with the flow protocol outlined here. Beyond these
issues, the lack of a positive control (induced cell death) prevented accurate
gating of dead cells vs live. As such, in order to optimise this approach with
flow, both for the staining and gating strategies, we plan to use a positive
control, which will be cell samples in which cell death has been induced.

Aim

Induce apoptosis in Nuvonis suspension cells using Hydrogen Peroxide treatment
and optimise flow cytometry staining and gating with apoptotic cells.

Experimental plan

We will induce apoptosis with 2 different concentrations of Hydrogen Peroxide
(H2O2): 10uM and 100uM. Cells will cultured in the presence of H2O2 for 48
hours before being fixed and stained with Annexin V FITC and DAPI, and
captured using flow cytometry.


Methods


  1. Cells were cultured in 50/50 RPMI/Hycell with GFs (mix #13174), media was added to take E250 volume to 100mL
  2. Flasks from the Growth Factor removal experiment were used for this cell death induction and the conditions were as follows:
    1. 12931 - With GF - No H2O2 (control)
    2. 12932 - With GF - 10uM H2O2
    3. 12932 - With GF - 100uM H2O2
    4. 12934 - With GF - No H2O2 (control)
    5. 12935 - With GF - 10uM H2O2
    6. 12936 - With GF - 100uM H2O2
  3. Briefly, 1ul of 3% H2O2 (stk #3943) was added to flasks 12932 and 12935; and 10ul 3% H2O2 (stk #3943) was added to flasks 12933 and 12936.
  4. Flasks were cultured at 37deg and shaken at 120rpm for 48 hours
