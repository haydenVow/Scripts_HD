Materials and Cost

EDDIE the bioreactor was built from a bain marie tray and matching lid. These
are also known as gastronorm pans. These are a common hospitality product and
are typically made of stainless steel.

These are able to be purchased online or locally at Chef's Warehouse in
Redfern. These are typically priced in the range of $10 - $25 AUD each.

  

To form modular shelving within the bain marie tray, perforated galvanised
steel sheets were purchased locally from bunnings warehouse and cut to size
with an angle grinder. Each each could be purchased for $8 and had enough
material to create two shelving layers inside the bain marie tray.

  

The holes in this sheeting fit M5 bolts so 10 mm long 316 stainless steel
bolts and nuts were used as legs for each shelf. Each shelf required 4 10mm M5
screws and 8 nuts, with two nuts on each 'leg'. This enabled only a small
portion of the bolt to protrude from the nut and lock into the holes of the
perforated shelf below. By spacing the legs in an alternating manner, each
shelf could stack on top of one another.

While galvanised steel is not as corrosion resistant as 316 stainless steel,
it was available in small quantities for low cost and was readily available.
For later designs, perforated 316 and 304 stainless steel is available,
however it comes in larger quantities and is much more expensive:

Surface Area and Media Requirements

With the first shelf in place, EDDIE the bioreactor requires 500 mL of media.
Each additional shelf requires an additional 300 mL of media. The shelves are
individually autoclaveable, providing flexibility in bioreactor surface area
requirements. Each shelf is 275 mm x 10 mm, providing 275 cm2 of surface area
per shelf.
