## Performed by: LL  




ACF media iteration:  E8_10C  

Volume of media being made:   650 mL




## Process

  1. Prepared 2M solution of GABA according to E8_9C Media Calculator instructions.
  2. Prepared 2M hypoxanthine solution according to E8_9C Media Calculator instructions.
  3. Added mL of F12 and  mL of DMEM to vessel (for making up to 2.5 L, used a filter unit or Schott bottle, for > 2.5 L used a carboy)
  4. Added all the ingredients needed for mL of E8 media  following E8 calculator spreadsheet.
  5. Added the amount of ACF ingredients as indicated in the E8_9C Media Calculator spreadsheet.
  6. If making 10C, 11B, 11C or 11E, added following ingredient (referred to recipes for volume/concentration (E8_10 iterations  and E8_11 iterations)):
    1. 10C: Glyoxylic acid  

      * Added 0.092 g Glyoxylix acid to 10 mL of E8 to make a 100 mM solution 
      * Added 325 uL Glyoxylic acid solution to ACF medium.
  7. Sterile filtered medium.
  8. Added mL of lipids to each aliquot (E8_9C Media Calculator).
  9. Wrapped bottle with foil to protect from light  
  10. Labelled and stored in fridge.
