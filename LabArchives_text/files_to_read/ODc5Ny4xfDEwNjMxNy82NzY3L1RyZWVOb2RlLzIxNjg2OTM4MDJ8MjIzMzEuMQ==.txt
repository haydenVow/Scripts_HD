Prepare the B12 initial stock and working stock solutions:

  1. Prepare a working stock of B12 in GM, sterile-filter (or whatever can be weighed in and serially diluted)
    1. A two-stage dilution process is required due to the extremely small quantities of B12 needed.

Stage 1: Initial stock

51 mg weighed out and solubilised in 51 mL MilliQ water (1mg/mL stock
concentration). This is a 1,000,000 ng/mL stock. Sterile filter and label as
Mix ID

Stage 2: Working stock

Dilute the 1,000,000 ng/mL initial stock in plain DMEM/F12 to make the working
stock. Dilute 50 uL of initial stock in 49.95 mL DMEM/F12 (1 in 10,000
dilution) to make a working stock of 100 ng/mL

Prepare materials for thaw and seed:

Aliquotted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then
placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath for a minimum of 20 minutes
prior to use:

  * Growth media aliquot for dilution of the WCB vial:   9  mL 
  * Aliquot 30mL of each of the media types made in the section below this one and warm them in a water bath at 30C for 20 minutes prior to use in the next step. 
  * Label each aliquot with the group # from above to tell them apart easily. 
  * Prepare 2x aliquots of B12-free GM for flasks 4 and 5
  * Time that aliquot was placed in the water bath to warm before use:   : a/pm 

  

Prepare Growth media by addition of B12 working stock for each T-flask to be
seeded:

Conc # 1 = 1.3125 ng B12 per T175 flask (0.05 ng/mL) 75mL = 2000x dilution of
working stock (75/2000) = 0.0375mL into 74.9625mL complete GM

Conc # 2 = 6.5625 ng B12 per T175 flask (0.25 ng/mL) 75mL = 400x dilution of
working stock (75/400) = 0.1875mL into 74.8125mL complete GM

Conc # 3 = 26.25 ng B12 per T175 flask (0.9 ng/mL) 75mL = 111.11x dilution of
working stock (75/111.11) = 0.675mL into 74.325mL complete GM

Conc # 4 = 0 ng B12 per T175 flask (0 ng/mL in this media stock) - make 100 mL
total of complete media for the control group and for use in resuspending the
freshly thawed vial of cells.

  




## Thaw vial, count cells and seed Tflasks:

  1. Collected the cryovial from Liquid Nitrogen storage & place in foam floater in water bath for 2 min or until only just thawed  11:10 -11 :12 a/pm   
Location where cryovial was collected from: Vial details:1  cryovials at   10M

  2. `Ethanol sprayed & transferred the vial(s) to the BSC.`
  3. `Aspirated the entire contents of the vial and transferred it into 9 mL of complete GM to make a final volume of 10 mL. Washed out the vial using the growth media to ensure extraction of as many cells as possible into the GM aliquot. `` ```
  4. `Using a 10mL serological pipette, resuspended & distributed the cells evenly in the  9 mL of pre-warmed Growth Media. `
  5. Perform a cell count and record live and dead cell #'s.
    1. Calculate live cells/mL
  6. Seed the flasks for each group with 1,312,500 live cells per T-flask (this is equivalent to 7500 live cells/cm2). Place the seeded flasks directly into the 30C incubator (do not leave them in the BSC for 30 minutes).``
  7. `Transfered flask/plate(s) to incubate at 11:35`  
[X ] 30ÂºC, 5% CO2 Incubator 116

  8. Incubate the cells at 30C for 3-4 days and then perform a 100% media change using the remaining volume of media of each type that was prepared above.
