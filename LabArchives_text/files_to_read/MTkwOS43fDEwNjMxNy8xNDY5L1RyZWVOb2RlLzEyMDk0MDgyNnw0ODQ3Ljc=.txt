Stained and imaged cells adhered to microcarriers

  1. Removed culture(s) from the incubator and placed them in the BSC  `| 9:10 am/pm|`
  2. Swirled culture(s) by hand on the flat surface of the BSC for 5 seconds, the lid was quickly removed and a 10-20uL sample of the suspension was taken while the liquid was still in motion. This ensures the carriers were evenly mixed at time of sampling.
  3. Transferred the aliquot(s) to a well on a 96 well plate and mixed it with 80-90uL of dPBS containing 1% w/v poloxomer 88 and 20uL/mL of Hoechst 33342. 
  4. Returned cultures to the incubator  `| 9:12 am/pm|`
  5. Left the 96 well plate to incubate at room temperature, in the dark (away from light), for 20 minutes.  `| 9:15 am/pm |`
  6. After incubation the wells were inspected under the Axio microscope, 5x objective.
  7. Using https://mia-capture.vow.tools/#/, 3 sets of same frame images using the DAPI and PHASE channels were captured for each well `| 9:25 am/pm|`
    1. Manually set the exposure time for DAPI channel to the exposure time seen when carriers are viewed using the automatic exposure adjustment [0.024ms]. (i.e if automatic exposure adjustment reads 0.002ms, set manual adjustment exposure time to be 0.002ms. 
    2. Fluorescence intensity of the UV lamp was adjusted until the centre of each microcarrier was barely visible compared to the space between microcarriers.
  8. Once images were captured, Image pairs were assigned a 'location ID' in MIA capture. (B1-B3, well 1 - 3
  9. Images captured were then selected for analysis using the 'uCarrier cell count plastic' tool from MIA capture. 

  




  1. Coat 11x384 well plates with 20uL of 0.1% gelatin for at least 1h at 37 degrees, 5% CO2  [ last well plate coated 10:40 -  11:40]. 
  2. Once coated remove the gelatin from the wells and fill each well with 50uL/well of DMEM/F12 + 20% FBS + 1X P/S + P38i (10uM) Growth Media. 
  3. Prepare two styrofoam boxes to transfer to the Garvan. 
    1. BOX A with the 12 x pre-growth media-filled 384-well plates, parafilmed, an ice pack, Hoechst (ddH20), extra FACS Buffer (PRF DMEM/F12 + 2% FBS + 10uM P38i) and the tubes containing cells.
    2. BOX B with 22 sheets of parafilm for sealing plates closed (11 needed, 11 excess) and spare tubes for the operator. 
  4. Prepare 5mL of DMEM/F12 + 20% FBS + 1xP/S + 10uM P38i growth media and store in the fridge at 4 degrees.
