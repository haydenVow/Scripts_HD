RELATED TO MILESTONE:  KR3 Achieve a biomass doubling time of <24h and a final
biomass of 5g/L in a 2L bioreactor, in ACF.

AIM/PURPOSE: To demonstrate the operation of the 2 L benchtop bioreactor for
microcarrier and suspension culture; to train others in the operation of the
bioreactor.

HYPOTHESIS: That the best way to improve the process and train others in the
process of operating the bioreactor is to operate real batches.

RESULTS SUMMARY: This should only be completed if the data can be visualised
with a single graph/image, otherwise simply state "See Report".

CONCLUSIONS: What were the overall findings? This should be a concise summary
and not duplicate the information in the results/report. For example "We found
that Bovine MuSCs could only achieve a cell density 50% of that observed with
planar culture without undergoing precocious differentiation. These results
mean that we are currently limited to X cells/ml in suspension culture until
we find a way to inhibit precocious differentiation"

NEXT STEPS: This should be a dot point list of any immediate outcomes, changes
to SOPs, as well as providing a direct link to any new experiments arising
from these findings. Importantly, this section should also include any
potential DEPLOYMENTS to the production team
