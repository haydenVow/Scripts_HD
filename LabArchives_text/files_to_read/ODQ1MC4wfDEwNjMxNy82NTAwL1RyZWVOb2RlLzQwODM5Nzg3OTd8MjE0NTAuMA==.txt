### Process:

1\. Took image of vessel with microscope on phase setting.

2\. Aliquotted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then
placed all aliquots in water bath

  1. TrypLE:   10  mL 
  2.  dPBS (for neutralising & washing):   20   mL
  3. Growth medium (for pellet resuspension):   5  mL




3\. Washed the vessel(s) with dPBS (warmed).

4\. Added Tryple to each vessel/well and incubated at 37ËšC.

  1. Start/Finish for TrypLE was    13:14 -  13:24

5\. Neutralised with dPBS and combined cell suspension in tube

6\. Centrifuged at 650 x g for 5 min.




7\. Aspirated the supernatant(s).

8\. Resuspended pellet(s) in     5    mL   growth   medium

9\. Placed on ice in esky
