Process:

1\. Aliquotted  10 mL  mL of  Growth Media into       tube(s). Placed in water
bath   13:40 pm

2\. Removed   100 % of supernatant from vessel.

3\. Replaced with  200 uL mL (per well/per vessel) of  growth   media.

4\. Returned vessel to incubate at:

  * [x]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (aviary cells)

  

  * [ ]  Thermo Incubator (ID #13)
  * [x]  Top Sanyo Incubator (ID #25)
  * [ ]  Bottom Sanyo Incubator
  * [ ]  Top Binder Incubator
  * [ ]  Bottom Binder Incubator




### Observations/Summary:

 100 % media changed on vessel(s)

Media in sample was yellow.

Also had a 24 well plate containing just the samples without cells. Saw
contamination or change in media colour in some of these wells.

Gluten:

100 degree sample show sligh plate yellow media

130 degree sample shows yellow media

autoclaved sample has slight pink/yellow media

Gluten + wheat

100 degree sample showed no change

130 degree sample has yellow media and contamination. formed a crust layer
ontop that was slightly white.

autoclaved sample showed minimal change

Wheat

100 degree sample had no change

130 degree sample had no change

autoclaved sample had yellow media.

  

Plate was discarded.
