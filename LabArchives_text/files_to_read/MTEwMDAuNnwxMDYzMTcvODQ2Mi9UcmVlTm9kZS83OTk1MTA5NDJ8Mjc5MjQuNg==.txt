  1. Identified contamination in flask 12530 (75/25), so discarded 
  2. Performed cell count on flask 12531 (count: 42,480,000)
  3. Transferred 25M cells (35 mL) to 1 x 50 mL tube
  4. Centrifuged at 500 x g for 5 min
  5. While tube was spinning, added 35 mL of fresh 50/50 medium to flask and replaced in incubator
  6. Retrieved tube from centrifuge, aspirated 100% of supernatant
  7. Re-suspended in 70 mL of 75/25 medium
  8. Placed in incubator
