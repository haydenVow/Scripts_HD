Aim/Purpose


To determine whether FGF from Reprokine slows cell doublings and/or causes
cell death when used in E810C (as opposed to using FGF from PeproTech).


Hypothesis


Cells growing in E810C with FGF from PeproTech will have faster doubling rates
than cells in E810C with FGF from Reprokine.


Technical Gap


We have not tested how FGF from Reprokine affects cell proliferation compared
to FGF from PeproTech.


Method/Procedure


  1. Thaw DOLLY12 WCB MuSC into 4x T25 flasks at 1000 cells/cm^2 into serum containing media (DMEM/F12 + 20% FBS + 1x P/S + 10uM p38i)
  2. 24 h later, perform a 100% media change to the following media conditions:
    1. DMEM/F12 + 20% FBS + 1x P/S + 10uM p38i (positive control)
    2. E810C with Reprokine FGF
    3. E810C with PeproTech FGF
    4. E810C no FGF (negative control)
  3. Keep cells in culture until they get to 10 doublings or stop growing (whichever comes first). Perform a 50% feed every 48 hours. Passage every 3-4 days and record cell numbers in this spreadsheet: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/19Foy6WldT2AJsA3H5ZR9gXnKBxG-E4D2RnTgPx-MWgE/edit#gid=1544829749.
