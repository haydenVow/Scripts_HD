Passage 1 - Seed 10M cells into 1x E125


# Procedure \- Thaw and Seed

1\. Extract required growth media into aliquots as listed in the table below
and place into a heated 37'C water bath for 20 minutes.

100% Growth Media Feed  
  
Flask Type

Volume of Media Required per flask (mL)

RPM speed  
E12530125  
E25060125  
E500180125  
E2000700  
100  
  
2\. Select the vial/s for thawing. Note the location of the vial in Liquid
Nitrogen(LN) Dewer.  
Path: Stockyard v1 > Frozen Cultures > Select Vial/s (Use highest number
first, ie 62of62)

3\. Obtain selected number of cryovial/s from LN Dewar and thaw in the 37'C
water bath on a foam floater for a maximum of 5 minutes.  
*NOTE: Ensure to wear PPE and work swiftly whilst performing this this task. Ensure to wear cryogloves and face shield when handling the liquid nitrogen dewar. Ask a Vowzer for help if required.

4\. Spray and wipe the cryovial and growth media thoroughly with 70% EtOH and
transfer into the Biohazard Safety Cabinet (BSC).

5\. Slowly add 500uL of growth media into the/each vial. This will produce a
total of 1.5mL cell suspension per vial.

6\. Resuspend the cells gently and transfer all contents from the vial to the
bottom of a 50mL falcon tube. *NOTE: Dispensing suspension of cells on the
sides of the tube will risk loss of cells in Step 11.

7\. Add an additional 500uL of growth media to each vial to collect remaining
cells and add into the centrifuge tube. A total of 2mL will be collected from
each vial.

8\. Resuspend cells thoroughly and immediately extract 50uL into a
microcentrifuge tube.

9\. Perform cell count (Refer to VSOP-007) from collected sample and use the
Cell Counting Widget (below) to enter data.

10\.  Extract all contents from the centrifuge tube and dispense into the
prepared growth media. Wash the tube with 5-10 mL of the same growth media to
extract remaining cells attached to the tube.  
11\. Add required volume of growth media to each flask, ensuring the entire
surface is coated. ``

12\. Transfer and incubate at 37'C on shaker plate at the recommended RPM (see
table above).
