Process
  
  
  1. Took 1 x 560 uL aliquot from each E500 and performed counts on ViCell.
  2. Recorded counts in media results spreadsheet: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1cnmEz5amKSGmA9u3BJ-Dn0w-I7zFobBr6pG-UWCYaXM/edit#gid=595130609
  3. Added 3.63mL of 200mg/mL glucose stock solution and 7.2037mL of L-glutamine 21.92 mg/mL stock solution to make up the concentration of these analytes in the final media 6g/L and 4mM, respectively.
  4. Confirmed pH hadn't changed by taking a 2 mL aliquot per media condition and measuring the pH value using the Hanna pHmeter (Hi5522).
  5. Added 372uL IGF-1L3 and 74uL of EGF per media bottle.
  6. Aliquoted 2mL of media into a 15mL tube for pH reading (see table below).
  7. Once pH has been measured, take 250 uL from the 2 mL sample of media taken for pH reading and dilute by adding 250uL MiliQ water. Then, freeze down aliquots in the -20'C.
  8. Combined 50/50 RPMI/CHO cultures into 1 x 500mL pot, containing a total of 358,800,000 cells in 400mL. 
  9. Took 3 x 93.645mL each of cell suspension containing 84M cells and dispensed into 3 x 250mL tubes, where each tube will be used to seed the flasks containing media with a starting pH of either 7.21, 7.52 or 7.81.
  10. Centrifuged 3 x 250mL at 500xg for 5 minutes.  
  
The following steps should be performed for each media condition- pH 7.21, pH
7.52 & pH 7.81:  
  

  11. While 3 x 250mL tubes are centrifuging, added the following volumes of media alone into the indicated number of E-125:
    1. 29 mL of media alone into 4 x E125 (these will be seeded at 100k cells/mL)
    2. 28 mL of media alone into 4 x E125 (these will be seeded at 200k cells/mL)
    3. 26 mL of media alone into 4 x E125 (these will be seeded at 400k cells/mL)
  12. Following centrifugation, wiped down each tube with a 70% ethanol-soaked RediWipe before moving to BSC 
  13. Aspirated the supernatant and resuspended cell pellet in each tube into 28 mL of media, so that the cell suspension in each tube corresponds to a different media condition- pH 7.21, pH 7.52 & pH 7.81.
  14. Dispensed:
    1. 1 mL of cell suspension into 4 x E125 (these will be seeded at 100k cells/mL)
    2. 2 mL of cell suspension into 4 x E125 (these will be seeded at 200k cells/mL)
    3. 4 mL of cell suspension into 4 x E125 (these will be seeded at 400k cells/mL)  

  15. Returned flasks to incubate at 120 RPM, 5% CO2, 37'C.

7.21

Observations/notes


\- Didn't confirm total cell count after combining 2 x E500.

\- Didn't confirm total cell count after aliquoting 84M cells into each 250mL
tube. After spinning down and resuspending into 28mL of medium, didn't check
whether cell density was 3M cells/mL.

This may explain some of the variation in cell count.
