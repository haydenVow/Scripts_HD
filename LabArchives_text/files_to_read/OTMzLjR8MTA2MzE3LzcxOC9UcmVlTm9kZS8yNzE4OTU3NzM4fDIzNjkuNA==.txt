Context & location of reagents

There are 14 x 50 mL black centrifuge tubes in the "media and gelatin" fridge
in Main Lab. They each have 43 mL of E6 in them. We need to add ECM
(extracellular matrix) ingredients to each tube in the order laid out below to
make them into 14 unique media conditions. The ECM ingredients are Collagen,
Fibronectin, Laminin and Vitronectin.

The Collagen and Fibronectin are both in the "ACF Media" container in the
short fridge next to the "Biomaterials" fridge. The Collagen (stock #1078) is
called "PureCol EZ Gel solution" and is in a small clear bottle. The
Fibronectin (stock #1404) is in a 1 mL vial in a clear bag.

The Laminin (stock #939) and Vitronectin (cat no. 5051-0.1MG) are both in the
first drawer down of the freezer opposite BSC2 (the drawer underneath the
E6/E8 box). They are in a 500 mL urine pot labelled "ECM ingredients for DSD".

All of the ECM ingredients are in solution so no need to reconstitute. The
Laminin and Vitronectin will just need to be thawed before use.

  

NOTE - LAMININ IN BAG IN THE 500ML POT WAS ALMOST EMPTY - INSTEAD WE USED
200UL ALIQUOT FROM A SMALL URINE POT WITH THE SAME STOCK ID

NOTE - IT WAS OBSERVED THAT TUBE WITH CONDITION 13 ONLY HAD 32ML COMPARED TO
THE EXPECTED 43ML SO THIS WAS MADE UP WITH E6 TO 43ML (ID 4629)  

Process

Note: The ECM ingredients are quite viscous. Make sure to pipette mix
thoroughly after each addition to ensure the full amount has been added.

  1. Collected 14 x 50 mL centrifuge tubes from fridge, ethanol-sprayed and transferred to BSC 
  2. Collected all four ECM ingredients, ethanol-sprayed and transferred to BSC 
  3. Starting with ECM1 (collagen), added the amount stated in the table below to each condition (check writing on 50 mL tubes to see which is for which condition).
  4. Repeated this process for each ECM ingredient. 
  5. Returned aliquots to fridge and ECM ingredients to respective locations (vitronectin will likely be almost completely empty)
