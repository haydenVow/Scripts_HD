# Procedure - Feed

# Note: Fibroblasts do NOT require Gelatin coated Flasks, and do NOT require
p38i.  

  1. Turn on the water bath and set to 37'C.
  2. Aliquot required growth media into a sterile container/s and place into the water bath. 
  3. Place in the water bath and heat for at least 20 minutes.
  4. Observe the cell flasks for confluence under the microscope using 4 x magnification and take images as required. 
  5. Transfer flasks to the BSC and remove required volume of media from each flask (according to the Table below).
  6. Replace the same volume into each flask with the prepared growth media.
  7. Return the flasks to the incubators

  
* Roller Bottles (R850) require 200mL for a 100% change and 100mL for a 50% change

All roller bottles had a small amount of cell aggregation in the flasks
(including the control). Cells were observed to have adhered, but there was
also alot of unattached cells. Alot of the cell aggregation occurred on the
top rim near the bottle neck, but also some at the very bottom rim. There were
2 small floating aggregates visible in set 4, but for all flasks the majority
of visible aggregate were still attached to the flask.

It should be noted that all flasks had semi tight lids except for set 5 which
was quite loose, so there may not have been enough gas exchange? However, all
flasks look very similar. All lids were loosened to the same extent this
morning. It should also be noted that roller speed was set to 0.5rpm for these
roller bottles*, which was different to the original setting of the roller
bottles seeded for batch 015 (which was timed to be 0.125rpm, i.e. 8 mins per
revolution.)

*[on the Thermo roller a 0.5rpm for roller bottles is a speed setting of 2]


Bottle 1 - 100% Media Feed
