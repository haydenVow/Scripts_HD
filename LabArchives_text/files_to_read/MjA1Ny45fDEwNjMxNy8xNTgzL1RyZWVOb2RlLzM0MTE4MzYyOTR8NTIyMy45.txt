### Process:

1\. Took image of vessel with microscope on phase setting.

2\. Gelatin coated    T75      x      1    vessel with sterile filtered 0.1%
gelatin solution and then incubated all coated flasks at 37˚C.

  1. Time when all vessels(s) placed into the incubator       10:44   

3\. Aliquotted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then
placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath for a minimum of 20 minutes
prior to use:

  1. TrypLE:    3.5     mL in     1    tubes (10 : 30)   

  2.  dPBS (for washing and neutralising):     6.5    mL in    a    tubes (10 : 30)   

  3. Growth media (for pellet resuspension and seeding):      13   mL in     1    tubes (10:35)  

Time that all aliquots were placed in the water bath the warm before use
indicated  in brackets  

Note: if aliquots were placed in water bath at different time, record the time
stamp for each individual solution.




4\. Removed vessel(s) from the incubator  

5\. Washed the vessel(s) with dPBS (warmed).

6\. Added     3    mL tryple to each vessel/well and incubated at 37˚C.

  1. Start/Finish for TrypLE was    10 :51 - 11:06   a/pm 

7\. Neutralised with      3    dPBS and combined cell suspension into a    1
tube.

8\. Centrifuged at 650 x g for 5 min.

  1. Start/Finish time for centrifugation was    11 : 10 - 11:15  a/pm 




9\. Aspirated the supernatant(s).

10\. Resuspended pellet(s) in     0.2    mL     GROWTH     media

11\. Aliquoted     10 uL     of resuspended cells into a microcentrifuge tube
for cell count.

12\. Performed a cell count using the haemocytometer and recorded the cell
count data in the Google Doc spreadsheet called 'Cell Count Spreadsheet' (see
link below):

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1DPzKubYxfHmWogVPihC-
SSIBtIylyrBQE5kRX5Z8NtI/edit#gid=0

  1.  Total cell number was:      611 000       

  2. Volume of cell suspension required for subculture was:        16.4 uL     

  3. Cell density per vessel:     50 000 cells in T75 flask      




13\. Transferred       16.4    µl of cell suspension to the pre-warmed
12    mL Growth media:  

14\. Transferred cell suspension into the pre-gelatin coated       T75
vessel.

15\. Left at RT in the BSC for 30 min to allow cells to settle     11 : 46 -
12:16  

16\. Transferred vessel(s) to incubate at:

  * [X]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (avian cells)

Observations/Summary:

All T25 flasks with ACF were not confluent enough for a passage.

T25 containing cells in serum were passaged to a T75 flask  (with 50k cells)
