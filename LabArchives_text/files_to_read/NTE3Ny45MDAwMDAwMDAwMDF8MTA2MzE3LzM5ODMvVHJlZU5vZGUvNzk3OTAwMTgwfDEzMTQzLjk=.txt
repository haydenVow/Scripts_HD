###  




Process:

  1. Aliquoted growth media as follows:
    * DMEM/F12 with growth factors - 10 mL
    * DMEM/F12 Boost with growth factors - 10 mL
    * RPMI with growth factors - 10 mL
    * RPMI Boost with growth factors - 10 mL
      * Placed in water bath  12:31   

  2. Prepared stain buffer in 15 mL tube by combining the following (2 drops Hoechst and 1 drop Sytox per 1 mL of dPBS):
    * 3 mL of filtered dPBS (does not have to be sterile - filtered to remove debris)
    * 3 drops of NucBlue Live Cell Stain ReadyProbes Hoechst 33342
    * 6 drops of NucGreen Dead 488 Cell Stain ReadyProbes Sytox Green
      * Vortexted mix for ~5 seconds, then stored in dark/coloured tube until ready to use.  12:46 

  

50 mL shake tubes

  1. Added protocol being used for feed as link below Process
  2. Loaded protocol linked below on computer next to OT2 and set up deck as described at calibration step
  3. Paused shaker by pressing the "play" button on the controller on the side wall of the incubator
  4. Collected  ~~8~~ 9 (also feeding culture #7415) x 50 mL shake tubes being fed from shaker 
  5. Centrifuged at 300 x g for 5 min.  12:54 - 12:59    

  6. Set up staining plate reagents (titled "staining plate" in protocols)
    1. For 6 or fewer samples: 
      1. Loaded 150 uL of stain buffer into column 1 of 96-well plate.
      2. Loaded 100 uL of filtered dPBS into columns 3 & 4 of 96-well plate.
    2. For 7-12 samples:
      1. Loaded 300 uL of stain buffer into column 1 of 96-well plate.
      2. Loaded 100 uL of filtered dPBS into columns 3, 4, 7 & 8 of 96-well plate.
  7. If applicable, added 100 uL samples from E-flasks to appropriate wells to be stained by OT2
  8. Ethanol-sprayed  8 x 50 mL shake tubes and loaded on OT2 
  9. Collected 8 x media aliquots from water bath, ethanol-sprayed, and loaded on OT2 deck. Ensured that media aliquots matched up with intended feed tubes i.e. medium in A1 of media tube rack is intended for culture in A1 of culture tube rack
  10. Order of culture IDs in culture tube rack (placed in ascending order of culture IDs):
    * A1: 7923-F_DOLLY12-Sheep P8-1of2
    * A2: 7929-F_DOLLY12-Sheep P8-1of2
    * A3: 7931-F_DOLLY12-Sheep P8-1of2
    * B1: 7933-F_DOLLY12-Sheep P8-1of2
    * B2: empty
    * B3: empty
  11. Order of culture IDs in culture tube rack (placed in ascending order of culture IDs):
    * A1: 7928-F_DOLLY12-Sheep P8-2of2
    * A2: 7930-F_DOLLY12-Sheep P8-2of2
    * A3: 7932-F_DOLLY12-Sheep P8-2of2
    * B1: 7934-F_DOLLY12-Sheep P8-2of2
    * B2: empty
    * B3: empty
  12. Calibrated for protocol 
  13. Ran protocol  
    1. Start time: 1:02:52 PM
    2. End time: 2:00 pm
    3. Total run time: 58 min 55 sec
  14. Plate map of culture IDs in 96-WP for imaging:

Incubator (#116), Lab [Main/Library/Production]




### Staining Process for cell count

  1. Incubated culture in stain at RT in dark for 20 - 30 minutes    ~13:30 - 14:02   

  2. Centrifuged the 96-well plate at 650 RCF for 1 minute. Timestamp:   14:08 - 14:09
  3. Took whole well micrographs using the Zaber microscope on blue & green fluorescence channels (DAPI & 488) 
    * Culture ID images were stored under:   NA - could not find any stained cells on either DAPI or 488 channel. Unsure as to whether this was an OT2 issue, a Zaber issue, or is because there are simply no cells in culture. Adding a positive control with leftover passaged cell suspension to next feed and stain run to check stain     

  4. Ran Mia analysis tool for suspension counts
