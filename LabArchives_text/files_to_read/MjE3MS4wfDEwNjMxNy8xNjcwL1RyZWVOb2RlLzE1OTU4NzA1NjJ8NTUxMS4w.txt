## Performed by: LL  




Reagent preparation:

1\. Aliquotted    40 mL  PBS for washing

2\. Centrifuged the secondary antibody stock using the benchtop
microcentrifuge for 10 seconds.

3\. Prepared Secondary Antibody mix (pipette from the top/supernatant of
antibody solution):

  12 µL   Secondary #1   (1:1000 ) +  12 µL   Secondary #2   (1:1000 ) +  12
mL Blocking Buffer (PBST (0.1% Triton X + dPBS) + 3% BSA)  

If using AlexaFluor secondary antibodies then the max concentration should be
1:500 (typically used at 1:1000)

Pipette-mixed antibody mix and stored refrigerated away from light until
needed.

 ~~4\. Prepared DAPI mix:  ~~

 ~~   mL  PBS +    uL  of DAPI~~

 ~~ ~~Vortexed DAPI mix and stored refrigerated away from light until
needed.~~~~

Process:

1\. Aspirated primary antibody mix.

2\. Washed 3 times for 5 min with PBS at RT.

 16:13 - 16:18  

 16:20 - 16:25  

 16:25 - 16:30

3\. Incubated the cells with secondary antibody mixture in the dark at RT for
1 hour.  16:30 - 17:30  

NOTE: from this step onwards protect from the light by wrapping plates in foil
and perform experiment in the dark.




Counter staining

1\.  Removed secondary antibody mix.  17:30  

 ~~2.  Washed with DAPI (1:1000) in PBS for 5 min at RT in the dark. ~~

 ~~  : - : a/pm ~~

3\.  Washed in PBS 3 x 5 min at RT in the dark. (No Triton)

 17:30 - 17:35  

 17:35 - 17:40  

4\.  Replaced dPBS.

 17:45

5\. Confirmed staining on microscope by imaging.




SOPs used:

  * SOP_Immunofluorescence Staining V_02

  




Observations/Summary:

\- Scaffolds stained with AF488 and AF555 secondary antibodies

\- Preliminary look under the Axio showed no signal on either channel, however
DAPI signal is still strong

### Results

  * Results were;
    * [ ]  As Usual (this is a repetitive task)
    * [x]  Unexpected because...expected to see at least MyoG on gelatin scaffolds
    * [x]  Need to be further analysed - need to image entire plate on zaber 
    * [ ]  Other (.......)
