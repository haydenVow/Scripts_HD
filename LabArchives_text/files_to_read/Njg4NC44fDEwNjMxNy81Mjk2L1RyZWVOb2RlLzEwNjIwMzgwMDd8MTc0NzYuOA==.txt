Process:

  1. Used the   WARM MEDIA: 2 x 20 mL (E6 & 2% HS)and the 2 x 20 ml aliquots of E6 and 2% HS for the COLD and RT media. WARM MEDIA SHOULD NOT BE WARMED AND THEN REFRIGERATED EVERY DAY!
  2. Placed 1 x E6 and 1 x 2% HS in water bath   11:15 am

  

Removed all C2C12 96 wp (5 plates in total) from the incubator into the BSC.

  1. Removed  100% (200uL) of E6 supernatant from 3 x 96 wp (All the wells contained between wells B3 to B11 and G3 to G11).
  2. Use 3 tips of the multi-channel pipette to aspirate the media from wells B3-B5 (horizontally).
  3. There is NO NEED TO CHANGE TIPS for the feeds of the 5 x 96 wp containing C2C12 cells.
  4. Add 200uL cold media to wells B3-B5 immediately.
  5. Aspirate from wells B6-B8 (horizontally).
  6. Add 200uL cold media to wells (still containing a small volume of media) B6-B8 immediately.
  7. Aspirate from wells B9-B11 (horizontally).
  8. Add 200uL cold media to wells B9-B11 after 10 secs.  

  9. Repeat for rows C (RT media), D (warm media), E (cold media), F (RT media), and G (warm media) in all 5 x 96 wp plates.
  10. Repeat for 2 x 96 wp containing 2% HS.
  11. Returned vessels to incubate at:   12:25 pm
