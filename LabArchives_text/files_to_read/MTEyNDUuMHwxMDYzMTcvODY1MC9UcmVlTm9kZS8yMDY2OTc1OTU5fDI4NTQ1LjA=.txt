Aim / Goal


Viabiility stain with propdium iodide (dead cells) with a Hoechst 33342
counter nuclei stain.


Hypothesis


Should see cell clumping within material, with a heterogenous population of
live/dead cells.


Protocol


  

## Before Starting, ensure the following is completed:

  * Label the 24-WP with the culture IDs for each scaffold in the staining well plate. You may have to stain in a 12-WP if the gel scaffold has expanded. 
  * Acquire sterile spoons for transporting the gels into the staining plate. 
  * Create the stain solution (2ug/mL concentration; Propidiumm Iodide (1ug/mL)/Hoechst 33342 (1ug/mL) [50:50]) 
    * Total volume needed: 12 mL (make up 13 mL)

## Perform the live-dead stain protocol.

1\. Remove the scaffold-cultures from the incubator

2\. Transfer each scaffolds to a  24 WP using a sterile spoon (forceps may
damage the structural integrity).

4\. Incubate for 20 mins with 500uL stain solution per well (2ug/mL of
Propidiumm Iodide (ID: ???) / Hoechst 33342 (ID: 8157)) in growth medium (no
GFs added).  1634 PM Media ID: 12912

5\. Remove excess media so that scaffolds sit on the bottom of well without
moving.

6\. Image the stained scaffolds with the Zaber.  1502 PM

Observations


Visual Observations:

The biogel component of the scaffold has begun to significantly breakdown by
day 6 in culture, this may be due to the following:

\- Insufficient initial crosslinking: Scaffolds may have been too thick for
the crosslinker to initially penetrate, or not enough time given.

\- Calcium from the caclium alginate matrix has leached out resulting in the
matrix falling apart.

\- Proliferation of the cells has resulted in mechanical stress in the matrix
resulting in breakdown.

This made transferring the scaffolds to the well plate quite difficult.
Appropriate washes with PBS could not be done under fear that scaffolds would
break down further.

Cells that have seperated from the gel has proliferated significantly faster
than those in the gel, leading to a higher metabolic load on the media.

  

Following experiment will need to incorporate or investigate the following:

\- A method for transferring scaffolds will need to be developed: Such as
using the scaffold cages previously developed.

\- Investigate how to maintain structural integrity of the scaffolds until end
of culture cycle.

  

Imaging Observations:

Initial observations showed a heterogenous population of live and dead cells
which is to be expected. An approximate (very rough) estimate will 66%
viability across all conditions. Cells encapsulated in the pork bun gel
appears to have proliferated in clumps/streaks through out the gel, even when
it has broken apart to some degree. The secondary components did not uptake
the cells as expected, this was seems to be due little cell migration through
the gel before delamination of the secondary material from the biogel.

How much of the cell death was due to the high metabolic load placed on the
media by the rapidly proliferating suspension cells that escaped into the
media is yet to be determined.
