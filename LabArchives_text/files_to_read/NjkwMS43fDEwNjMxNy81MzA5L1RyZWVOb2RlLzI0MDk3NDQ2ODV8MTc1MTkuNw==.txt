RELATED TO MILESTONE:  

KR1: Develop a QMS-compliant serum-free media that supports 20+ doublings of
our chosen species in suspension

KR4: Establish and run a suspension pipeline at a rate of 10,000 clones per
month.

AIM/PURPOSE:

To compare suspension adaptation of F_CHOMP09 cells in 24 DWP, 50 mL shake
tubes, and E125 flasks.

To see whether F_CHOMP09 cells can adapt to suspension in CD CHO + 20% KSR +
10G supplement.

11G supplement = 1:100 glutamax, lipid supplement 1:1000, 1 g/L pluronic,
1:100 ACA, 100ng/mL each of FGF, IGF1, PDGF, RGD 100 ng/mL, and YIGSR 100
ng/mL +1x p/s

HYPOTHESIS:

Cells will adapt to suspension adaption better (higher cells/mL will be
achieved) in E125 flasks than in 24 DWP and 50 mL shake tubes.

CHOMP cells will adapt to suspension in CD CHO + 20% KSR + 11G supplement .

RESULTS SUMMARY:

Cell density decreased more rapidly and remained low throughout the experiment
when 24 dwp were used when compared to E125 flasks and 50 mL shake tubes.

None of the conditions tested yielded suspension adapted cell lines. However,
there were many limitations to this experiment so it may be worth repeating
the experiment after addressing these.

  

CONCLUSIONS:

Under the conditions tested, larger vessels sustained higher cell counts (per
mL) for a longer period post seeding. Increasing the seeding density can
improve of cell survival.

NEXT STEPS:

  * Continue fast adaptation experiments in E125 flasks
  * Use suspension cloning pipeline to develop a clonal suspension adapted cell line
  * Try using 24 dwp in shaking incubator with 50 mm orbital diameter
  * Try using 24 dwp for media optimisation with suspension adapted cell lines, rather than for the process for suspension adaptation
