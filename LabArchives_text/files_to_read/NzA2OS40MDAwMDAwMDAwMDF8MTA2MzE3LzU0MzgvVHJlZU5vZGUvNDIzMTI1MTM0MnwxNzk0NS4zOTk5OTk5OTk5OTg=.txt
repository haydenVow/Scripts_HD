RELATED TO OKR:  

OKR 2 \- Characterise 2x QMS-compliant suspension-adapted fibroblast clones
from our chosen species

OKR 4 \- Establish and run a suspension pipeline at a rate of 10,000 clones
per month.  

AIM/PURPOSE: Process in which FreeStyle CHO-S suspension adapted cell line
will be expanded to generate a MCB to use as a control in suspension culture
experiments.

HYPOTHESIS:

N/A

RESULTS SUMMARY:

550 million CHO-S were frozen in liquid nitrogen after 7 days in culture.
Additionally doubling times decreased from ~45 hrs (Day 4) to ~19 hrs (Day 7).

CONCLUSIONS:

An MCB of CHO-S (~550 million) was successfully generated after 1 week in
suspension culture for science R&D experiments, in particular serving as a
positive control for suspension experiments. Whilst the CHO-S cells exhibited
long doubling times in the 1-4 day time period following the thaw, by day 7 in
culture the CHO-S demonstrated doubling times (~19 hrs) comparable those
highlighted in the manufactures user guide (16-22 hrs). Finally the addition
of pen-strep after thawing did not impact cell growth despite manufactures
recommendation on excluding it during the first few passages (2-3).

NEXT STEPS:

  * Evaluate if CHO-S cells can survive in different basal mediums. FreeStyle CHO is an expensive chemically defined media and not feasible for the large scale expansion or continual culturing of CHO-S cells due to its procurement cost. Therefore if may be beneficial to evaluate cheaper alternatives (i.e. CD-CHO, RPMI or DMEM/F12)
  * Generate a WCB of CHO-S cells, only if required
