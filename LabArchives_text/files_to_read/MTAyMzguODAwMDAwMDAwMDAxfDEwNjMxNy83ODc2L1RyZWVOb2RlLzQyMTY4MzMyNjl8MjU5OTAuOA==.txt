Prepare Cells for nucleofection

Cells used for this experiment were taken from the following epic (EPIC30430)

  1. Aliquoted out 2 x 100 mL of dPBS (wash and neutralising), 100 mL of Tryple, and 20 mL of dPBS for resuspension and placed all aliquots in the water-bath ready for passage.
  2. Media was removed from cells, 2CF was washed with 100 mL dPBS and tryplised with 100 mL.
  3. Tryple was incubated for 8 minutes at 30 degrees, 5% CO2. 
  4. Tryplised cells were neutralised with 100 mL PBS.
  5. Cells were placed in a 250 ml centrifugation tube. 
  6. Cells were centrifuged for 5 minutes at 400g.
  7. Supernatant was removed and cells were resuspended in 20 mL of pre-warmed dPBS.
  8. Cell count was performed under a hemocytometer after a 10uL aliquot was taken and diluted 1:2 using trypan blue (final dilution 2)
  9. The number of cells required for the experiment was determined. 
    1. Cells for Condition 1 (ZIC1 guide 2 ) transfection = 8,802,500 cells
    2. Cells for Control transfection = 8,802,500 cells  
We therefore need  30 x 10^6 cells (cells will likely not double from Monday
to Thursday when we put them into 6 x 50 ml suspension culture tubes, reason
why we need the total 30M cells prior to nucleofection (5M cells per 5 ml in
each 50 ml tube).

Total cell number harvested = 21,280,000 cells

10\. 2 x 2CF were prepared to receive nucleofected cells based on total cell
number counted (see above).2 x 2CF were filled with 2 x 300  mL of DMEM/F12 +
20% FBS WITHOUT ANTIBIOTICS!

  * 2 x 2CF were placed in the incubator (30 degrees, 5% CO2) to warm plates with media [incubator 140].

  




## *Ensure cell count is performed before determining how much of the
following reagents to make

  

Prepare guides/cas9/Cas9 electroporation enhancer

  1. Guides in TE buffer (44 uM) (stored at -20) were retrieved from the freezer, (reconstitute new guides in 45.45uL of TE buffer if required). 
  2. Made up Cas9 mix. *Below is a 1 x mix for 1 well, multiply by the number of zaps you intend to perform, then x 1.1 to get total volume required for experiment.

4\. Incubated mix for 10-20 min, (tubes were left in the bench hood for 10-20
minutes to incubate at RT).

5\. While incubating, the Electroporation enhancer was prepared.

  1. Buffer was removed from -20 freezer and thawed using body temperature. 
  2. Mixes for each guide were made up to 10.8 uM solutions using 1 x TE buffer. *Below is a 1 x mix for 1 well, multiply by number of wells you intend to make x 1.1 to get total volume required for experiment.

Nucleofection

  1. Two 15 ml sterile falcon tubes were set up inside the BSC and labelled 1-2. Volumes of cell suspension in dPBS were transferred to each tube as per the guide below. 
    1. Tube 1 -  ZIC1 (8.273 mL of cell suspension)
    2. Tube 2 - Control (8.273 mL of cell suspension)
  2. The cells were centrifuged at 400g for 5 mins at room temp (HINGE OUT IN CENTRIFUGE)
  3. The supernatant was removed from each tube. It is important to remove as much as possible. Use a 1 mL tip to remove most of the supernatant and then switch to a 200 uL pipette to remove a little more if necessary. Do not disturb the pellet.
  4. To each Eppendorf tube the following mix was prepared, R buffer added first, then enhancer, then RNP. 
  5. *NOTE: Use the same nucleofection tip for 12 zaps (We will use 2 x nucleofection tips/condition given we seed 2 x 2CF). Use the same electroporation buffer for the 22.5 reactions per condition in the same tube. Change the tube as well as the electroporation buffer when changing condition.

2CF: GIVEN THE SECOND COLUMN OF THIS TABLE INDICATES THE VOLUME TO ADD PER
NUCLEOFECTED WELL CONSIDERING THE 400K CELLS THAT ARE SEEDED IN A SINGLE WELL
OF A 6-WP, I DIVIDED THE NUMBER OF CELLS WE WOULD SEED IN 1 X 2CF (9M) BY THE
NUMBER OF CELLS SEEDED IN A A SINGLE WELL IN A 6-WP (400K) TO CALCULATE THE
NUMBER OF REACTIONS WE WOULD HAVE AND THUS THE AMOUNT OF REAGENTS TO ADD.

In the case of having exactly 18M cells this is what the amounts would look
like:

Component1x Amount (uL) 22.5 x Controls (no RNP, complex/use TE buffer
instead) (uL)22.5 x target (uL)  
RNP complex from above0.8318.67518.675  
R buffer7.5168.75168.75  
10.8 uM electroporation enhancer1.6737.57537.575  
Total10225225  
  
Another way of calculating the number of zaps/reactions we need to perform in
order to nucleofect the number of cells we intend to seed for this experiment
is:  
  
0.4M cells (400k cells) x 3 (3 wells in one row of a 6-wp)= 1.2M cells/row x 4
rows (we usually use 4 rows of nucleofected cells to seed our suspension
cultures) = 4.8M cells  
4.8 M cells x 3 (we want to establish 3 suspension cultures per condition for
this experiment)= 14.4M cells  
  
In order to seed 14.4M cells we need to zap our cells 12 (wells zapped per
suspension culture) x 3 (we want to establish 3 x suspension cultures) = 36
zaps

17.The nucleofection machine was set up and CFs retrieved from incubator

18.The neon tip was inserted into the mix from above and draw up cell mix

19\. The cells were electroporated with the 1 conditions below:

Voltage Pulse WidthPulse Number  
1700201  
  
20\. Cells were placed into a vessel containing 300 ml of growth media per
condition without antibiotics and this vessel was continuously shaking in
order to avoid cells from adhering to the vessel.

21\. After 22.5 zaps, the growth media containing the nucleofected wells was
used to seed each of the conditions.

22\. Re-seed the remaining 3.454 ml (3675000 cells; 1.225k cells per flask
seeded at 7k cells/cm^2) of cell suspension into 3 x T175.

  


Observations


Note*: We only had 7.7 uL of ZIC1 guide 2 left so, we added an extra 1.8uL of
TE buffer to keep the volumes the same even if the concentration of the sgRNA
in our RNP complex will be lower than what is required.

There was enough reaction volume for 25 zaps for each condition. We think the
extra zaps were a result of the water held by the big cell pellets.
