### Process:

1\. Aliquotted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then
placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath for a minimum of 20 minutes
prior to use:

  1. Growth media (for resuspension):     50    mL 

Time that all aliquots were placed in the water bath the warm before use
09:31

Note: if aliquots were placed in water bath at different time, record the time
stamp for each individual solution.




2\. Removed vessel(s) from the incubator  09:35

3\. Transfer the entire contents into sterile 50 mL flacon tubes filtering
through a 40 um filter to remove aggregates that have formed

4\. Centrifuged at 300 x g for 5 min.

  1. Start/Finish time for centrifugation was   09:41 - 09:46   




5\. Aspirated the supernatant(s).

6\. Resuspended pellet(s) in    50     mL     Growth     media each   09:54  

7\. Perform cell count using a haemocytometer and record counts below:

557,500,000

  1. Calculate the required volume cell suspension & freeze medium to generate a concentration of ~10M cells/mL.  
10 vials will be frozen at 10M per vial (total 100M)  
9 vials will be frozen at 50M per vial (total 450M)




8\. Prepared  19 mL Freeze Medium: (Freestyle CHO + 10% DMSO). ID M8814  

Stored at 4ºC until use to keep chilled.

9\. Centrifuged cells at 300 x g for 5 min.  10:33  \-  10:38

  1. Split the total 50 mL cell resuspension into two aliquots one at 9 mL (100M cells) and the other at 43 mL (450M)

Whilst centrifuge is spinning, prepared & printed vial labels, labelled
cryovials. (Note that passage number will be the same as the culture you
harvest from. The passage number will increase by 1 during the revive of a
vial.)




9\. Aspirate the supernantant

9\. Resuspended the pellet in | 10 mL (for 100M aliquot) and 9 mL (for 450M
aliquot) | freeze media (chilled, to reduce DMSO toxicity).

10\. Aliquotted | 1000 |µL into | 19 | x cryovials (already labelled).

11\. Tightened the lids & transfer the cryovials to a Mr. Frosty immediately
into the -80ºC freezer.   11:05

12\. Allow the cells to freeze for at least 18-24 hours before transferring to
Liquid Nitrogen storage.
