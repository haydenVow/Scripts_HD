Process:

1\. Aliquotted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then
placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath for a minimum of 20 minutes
prior to use:

  1. TrypLE:    30   mL in  1 x 70 ml     tubes
  2. dPBS (for neutralising & washing)   60 ml    mL in  1 x 70 ml   tubes
  3. Growth media (for seeding):   300   mL in   1 x 1000 ml     storage container




2\. Washed the flask(s) with dPBS.

3\. Added   10    mL tryple to each vessel/well and incubated at 37˚C for   8
min.

Note: Fibroblasts typically require 15-18 minutes of incubation with tryple,
slightly longer than MuSCs.

4\. Neutralised with   10    dPBS (warmed) and combined cell suspension into
2 x 50 ml   tube.

5\. Centrifuged at 400 x g for 5 min




6\. Aspirated the supernatant(s)

7\. Resuspended pellet(s) in     5 mL    growth  media.

8\. Performed a cell count using the haemocytometer and recorded the cell
count data in widget or the Google Doc spreadsheet called 'Cell Count
Spreadsheet' (see link below):

9\. Total cell number was:   7,720,000 cells  

Recorded this number on the Project Frankenstein daily planner.

10\. Seeded ~6.2k cells per cm2 of the flasks/plates. Note that fibroblasts
prefer to be subcultured closely together.

11\. Volume of cell suspension required for subculture was:  5 ml  

12\. Transfer   5 ml  of cell suspension to the pre-warmed   300 ml  Growth
Media.

13\. Transfer cell suspension into (non-gelatin coated)  1 x 2CF
flasks/plates.

14\. Transfer flask/plate(s) to incubate at:

  * [ ]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (aviary cells)
  * [X]  30ºC, 5% CO2 (reptilian cells)




Observations/Summary:

Cells looked extremely healthy. They were round, similar in size and had
solid, smooth membranes. Unfortunately though, their doubling time reduced
when compared to the previous passage. This could potentially be a result of
the observed uneven seeding, where the ends of the flasks had barely any cells
and the tops were extremely confluent (see pictures on mia capture for
reference).
