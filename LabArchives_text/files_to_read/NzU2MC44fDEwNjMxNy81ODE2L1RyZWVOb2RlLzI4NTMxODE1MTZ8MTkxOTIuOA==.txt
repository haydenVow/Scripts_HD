Lab Archives. Please complete the Link to Clubhouse, Aims and Hypothesis
BEFORE you begin the experiment.

At the completion of any EPIC please do the following:  
1\. Ensure all sections of this page are complete  
2\. Email a link to this page to the project leader  
3\. Project leaders will then review all information and digitally sign this
page (click the screwdriver and wrench icon in the top right of this page)  
4\. Project leaders should then send a link to the signed page to James Ryall

RELATED TO OKR: PPP_Q4_KR2_Characterise 2 x QMS-compliant suspension-adapted
fibroblast clones from our chosen species

AIM/PURPOSE: To generate a population of crocodile fibroblasts treated with
UV-irradiation and a P53-inhibitor to be seeded into suspension culture

HYPOTHESIS: We hypothesise that a high percentage of cells exposed to UV
irradiation will enter apoptosis, however the presence of a P53 inhibitor will
protect sufficient numbers to then be expanded for seeding into suspension
culture
