### Process:

1\. Took image of vessel with microscope on phase setting.

2\. Gelatin coated      2 wells of 24 well plate with sterile filtered 0.1%
gelatin solution. Coated 4 more wells with vitronectin (1.5ug/cm^2) and then
incubated plate at 37˚C.

  1. Time when all vessels(s) placed into the incubator      9 : 39  am 

3\. Aliquotted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then
placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath for a minimum of 20 minutes
prior to use:

  1. TrypLE:     16    mL in     1    tubes    9 : 46  am   

  2.  dPBS (for washing and neutralising):     38    mL in   1     tubes    9 : 46  am   

  3. Growth media (for pellet resuspension and counts):     600 uL for each condition    in    6   tubes     10:40   am   

Note: if aliquots were placed in water bath at different time, record the time
stamp for each individual solution.




4\. Removed vessel(s) from the incubator

5\. Washed the vessel(s) with dPBS (warmed).

6\. Added   0.2     mL tryple to each vessel/well and incubated at 37˚C.

  1. Start/Finish for TrypLE was    9:57 - 10:12. Checked cells undser microscope and pipetted tryple up and down in each well. Incubated again until 10:22  

7\. Neutralised with     0.5 mL     dPBS and collected cell suspension into a
1   tube for each condition.

8\. Centrifuged at 650 x g for 5 min.

  1. Start/Finish time for centrifugation was    10 :31 - 10:36   am 




9\. Aspirated the supernatant(s).

10\. Resuspended pellet(s) in

       0.1    mL media  

11\. Aliquoted       5 uL   of resuspended cells into a microcentrifuge tube
for cell count.

12\. Performed a cell count using the haemocytometer and recorded the cell
count data in the Google Doc spreadsheet called 'Cell Count Spreadsheet' (see
link below):

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1DPzKubYxfHmWogVPihC-
SSIBtIylyrBQE5kRX5Z8NtI/edit#gid=0

  1.  Total cell number was:   
    1. condition 1:    6 400 cells     

    2. condition 2:   no cells seen  on haemocytometer      

    3. condition 3:    no cells seen on haemocytometer     

    4. condition 4:    did not attempt to count      

    5. condition 5:     did not attempt to count     

    6. condition 6:   did not attempt to count      
  2. Volume of cell suspension required for subculture was:  
    * condition 1:     30 uL (1900 cells)      

    * condition 2:    100 uL (all of suspension)     

    * condition 3:     100 uL (all of suspension)   

    * condition 4:     100 uL (all of suspension)     

    * condition 5:     100 uL (all of suspension)     

    * condition 6:   100 uL (all of suspension)        




13\. Transferred        the required volume  cell suspension for subculture
into each of the pre-warmed      0.5     mL Growth media:  

14\. Transferred cell suspension into the wells of 24 well plate.  

15\. Left at RT in the BSC for 30 min to allow cells to settle     11  : 34 -
12 : 04  

16\. Transferred vessel(s) to incubate at:

  * [X]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (avian cells)

summary:

Passaged 6x wells of 24 wp into 6x wells of 24 well plate

observation of cells before passage:

Wells with B8 media formulations did not seem to have any live cells visible
(There were dead floating cells visible in conditions 4,5, and 6). I passaged
them just in case but suspect that they will have to be discarded due to the
absence of cells. condition 2 appeared to have more cells than condition 3.
Both E810C conditions had cell less visible than serum control.

notes about working with 24 wp:

working with small vessels for these experiments may not be ideal since it is
difficult to obtain a cell count from wells of a 24 wp. After centrifuging
cells, the pellets are not visible so it's difficult to aspirate all of the
supernatant. Then, when pellets are resuspened they have to be resuspended
into small volumes (<50uL). A significant portion of this volume (at least
5uL) needs to be used for cell counts. There's a lot of room for error.




### Results:

  * Results were;
    * [X]  As Usual (this is a repetitive task)
    * [ ]  Unexpected because...
    * [ ]  Need to be further analysed
    * [ ]  Other (.......)
