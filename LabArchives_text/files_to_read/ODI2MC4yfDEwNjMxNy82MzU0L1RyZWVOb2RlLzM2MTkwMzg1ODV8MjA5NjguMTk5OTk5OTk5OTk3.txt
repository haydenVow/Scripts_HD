Staining

Prepared dead stain solution in amber/black centrifuge tube:  
\- 1 mL dPBS  
\- 1 drop Nucgreen AF488 dead stain  
\- Vortex for 5 seconds to mix

Prepared Hoechst stain (50 ug/mL) solution in amber/black centrifuge tube:  
\- 9500 uL MilliQ  
\- 500 uL Hoechst Trihydrochloride trihydrate (1mg/mL)  
\- Vortex for 5 seconds to mix. Solution can be stored at 4Â°C for up to 6
months

  1. Took 100 uL samples from each culture flask
  2. Added 20 uL of Hoechst stain directly to cells
  3. Added 80 uL of dead stain solution (dPBS+Nucgreen) to cells
  4. Incubated for 30 minutes in the dark at room temperature  15:19-15:49
  5. Made 4x, 8x and 16x dilutions of the sample in dPBS 
  6. Centrifuged plates at 300 RCF for 1 minute 16:01-16:02

Observations/Summary:  
Due to several weeks of dropping cell counts and no apparent increases in cell
density these cultures will be terminated. In a last ditch effort to promote
cell division, these cultures will be pooled and used to inoculate an E250.
