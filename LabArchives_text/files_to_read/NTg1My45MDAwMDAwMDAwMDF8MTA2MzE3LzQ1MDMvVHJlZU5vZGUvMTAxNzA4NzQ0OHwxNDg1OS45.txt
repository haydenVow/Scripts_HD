Media/Reagents used:

NameDetails  
dPBS  
Mix #7046  
  
PFA  
Alq #3079  
  
  
  

PBS needed: 32 ml, but aliquotting 40 ml/person

PFA: 4 ml needed, but aliquoting 5ml/person

  




Process:

Fixing ( ~ 20 - 30 min)

  1.  Removed media from each well and wash once with PBS 12:40 - 12:45 pm.
  2.  Added 100 µL PFA for 15 min:  12:46 - 1:01 pm
  3. Washed with  200 µL dPBS twice:
  4.  1:02 - 1:07 pm &1:08 - 1:13 pm
  5. Added 200 µL  dPBS in each well, parafilmed and stored in the fridge.

  




Observations/Summary:

###  

All cells in rows C and E were void of cells due to cell death observed in
wells with 2% HS Diff media and feeds. Note that all cells in wells F7-F10
appear to be differentiating, and did not observe the same cell death. Will
need further investigation.

i.e. all wells that had feeds and were in 2% HS diff media died/detached from
the 96-well plate.

all wells that had 2% HS diff media added on Day 0 of differentiation and did
not undergo any additional feeds appear in tact and differentiating.

  

This is unlike plate 8414-DOLLY12-Sheep P10-2of4 (part of another experiment
running simultaneously), which observed cell death and detachment only in
wells in row C (100% feed with 2% HS diff media), and the cells in row E (50%
feeds with 2% HS diff media) appeared unaffected.
