Setting up the STR2000 bag: VP,AK,AV,AnV,JB

  * During bag setup it was noticed that the clamp used to hold the bottom of the bag in place was missing and may have been thrown out with the last bag.
  * Sartorious was called to resolve this issue and find out how essential this part is. We could not get a replacement part on short notice but have placed an order to get a new one along with some backups
    * We were informed that there was a chance that the bag would rotate without this anchor but we did not experience any drift during the running of the bag
  * When attaching the pH and DO probes on 14/06 we noticed that we only have 2 optical probe clamps. It was therefore decided to use the optical probes clamps for DO probes only and the electrochemical probes for pH
