Moved the sterile bioreactor vessel and bottles from the autoclave to near a
BSC

  1. Waited for the autoclaving chamber to cool to 60-70 deg C
  2. Opened the chamber and checked connections to make sure that all vessels remained sealed. In the event that any tubing popped off, rinsed the connections with 70% ethanol and reconnected; or, re-autoclaved the entire assembly.
  3. Placed the vessel and bottles on a trolley and moved the trolley next to a BSC.

Filled the liquid addition bottles

  1. Thoroughly wiped down each of the bottles and their attachments with 70% ethanol
  2. Placed all of the bottles in a BSC EXCEPT for the seed bottle.
  3. Emptied any residual water in the bottles into a waste container.
  4. Filled the bottles with their respective liquids (if required).
    1. For microcarriers, aseptically transfer 2.5 g dry weight equivalent into the "seed" bottle  
  
For 20g/L Cytodex 1 in dPBS, we require 125 mL of solution to obtain 2.5 g dry
weight of microcarriers.  
  

    2. Wait for microcarriers to settle
    3. Decant supernatant
    4. Add equivalent volume of fresh medium
    5. Wait for microcarriers to settle
    6. Decant supernatant
    7. Resuspend up to 300 mL in fresh medium 
  5. Closed the lids and left the bottles in the BSC.

NotesO rings on autoclaved schott bottles may be sticky, When fixing the
autoclaved bioreactor lids to the schott bottle ensure lid detaches easily.
otherwise transfer the contents of your innoculum to the autoclaved schott
bottle.  
  
  
  




Connected the liquid addition bottles to the bioreactor vessel

  1. Thoroughly wiped down the female STT connectors attached to the tubes that are attached to the bioreactor vessel.
  2. Placed the female STT connectors in the BSC.
  3. Removed the cap from a female STT connector with two hands
  4. While still holding the female STT connector in one hand, removed the cap from the male STT connector with one hand and connected the male and female parts together.
  5. Ensured that the correct male and female parts were connected.
  6. Unclamped all of the lines after everything was connected.
  7. Repeated the previous steps for all female/male STT connector pairs EXCEPT for the seed bottle.
  8. Removed the bottles from the BSC and placed on the trolley with the bioreactor vessel.
  9. Transferred the bottles and vessel to the bench next to the control tower.

NotesGenerally, bottles containing liquids going into the culture should be
connected to the multiport on the top of the reactor. Don't connect
microcarrier containing innoculum to the multiport, it will block the tube.
Instead, fill via the harvest tube  
  
  
  




Added the culture medium & microcarriers

  1. Pumped out the waste liquid.
  2. Pumped in ~500 mL of microcarriers in fresh growth medium until the level just covered the impeller.
  3. Ensured that there was enough growth medium to completely submerge the impeller, sparger and probes, and enough to reach the bottom of the sample dip tube.

    Fitted the liquid addition/removal lines into the peristaltic pumps

  1. Opened the peristaltic pump heads.
  2. Placed the tubing from each bottle in the respective persitaltic pump head.
    1. 2 L feed bottle in "LEVELT"
    2. 250 mL base bottle in "BASE"
    3. 500 mL seed bottle in "SUBS-B"
    4. 10 L waste bottle/2 L harvest bottle (joint line) in "SUBS-A"
      1. Clamped off the harvest line
  3. Ensured that the tubing was the correct way round as the pumps turn only in one direction.
  4. Closed the pump heads.
  5. Placed the feed bottle in the bar fridge under the bioreactor bench.

NotesAnti-foam and base lines should always go to anti-foam and base pump
respectively because they are automatically controlled.  
  
  
  




Primed the feed tubes

  1. Ran each persitaltic pump from the Biostat control software to fill the liquid addition tubes.
    1. Only for LEVELT and BASE pumps
  2. Set the totaliser to 0 after priming all tubes.
    1. Priming the tubes and the setting the totalizer to 0 ensures that the control unit will record the correct volume of liquid during the run.

Fitted and connected the heating blanket

  1. Fitted the heating blanket around the lower portion of the glass vessel (tough side touching the glass and soft spongy side facing out).
  2. Ensured that the heating blanket was connected to the control tower.

out. Try not to cover the volume measurements on the side of the glass.  
  
  
  
  




Fitted and connected the exhaust heater

  1. Stretched the flaps of the heater over the exhaust filter (so that the filter is "sandwiched" between the tough flaps).
  2. Ensured that the heater was connected to the control tower.
