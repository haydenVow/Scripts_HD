Background: Cells have been increasing in cell numbers steadily over the past
2 weeks, but are also all showing up dark when stained with trypan blue.  We
decided to further investigate the staining to determine if the cells are
alive or not




Methods:

1\. Collected 20uL of sample in 1.7mL snap tube

2\. Added 10uL of UNSTAINED sample to hemocytometer

3\. Added 10uL of trypan blue to remaining 10uL sample, and added 10uL of
trypan stained sample to hemocytometer

4\. Imaged both stained and unstained samples at 10x

Stained

Unstained

  




Results/Conclusion: Both stained and unstained cells appear dark, suggesting
that the cells' membranes are not actually compromised-- the cells are just
naturally dark.
