## Performed by: LL  




Reagent preparation:

1\. Aliquotted     36mL  PBS for washing

2\. Centrifuged the secondary antibody stock using the benchtop
microcentrifuge for 10 seconds.

3\. Prepared Secondary Antibody mix (pipette from the top/supernatant of
antibody solution):

  1.5 µL   goat anti mous IgG2b AF555   (1:1000  ) +  1.5 µL   goat anti mouse
IgG1   (1:1000  ) +  1.5  mL Blocking Buffer (PBST (0.1% Triton X + dPBS) + 3%
BSA)  

If using AlexaFluor secondary antibodies then the max concentration should be
1:500 (typically used at 1:1000)

Pipette-mixed antibody mix and stored refrigerated away from light until
needed.

4\. Prepared DAPI mix:

   3mL  PBS +    3uL  of DAPI

Vortexed DAPI mix and stored refrigerated away from light until needed.

Process:

1\. Removed plate from fridge (incubated in primary antibodies overnight).

2\. Washed 3 times for 5 min with 200uL PBS at RT.

 12:30 - 12:35

 12:36 - 12:41

 12:42 - 12:47

3\. Incubated the cells with 50uL of secondary antibody mixture in the dark at
RT for 1 hour.  12:49 - 13:50  

NOTE: from this step onwards protect from the light by wrapping plates in foil
and perform experiment in the dark.




Counter staining

1\.  Removed 2nd antibody solution.  13:50

2\.  Washed with 100uL of DAPI (1:1000) in PBS for 5 min at RT in the dark.

 13:52 - 13:57

3\.  Washed in 200uL PBS 2 x 5 min at RT in the dark. (No Triton)

 13:58 - 14:06

 14:07 - 14:14

4\.  Replaced dPBS (200uL)

 14:17

5\. Confirmed staining on microscope by imaging using the Zaber, taking 1
image in the centre of each well for all wells  (1x1 grid using the HCS
generator)
