200K cells/mL  
Note: These cultures are also being used as controls in experiment 828. In
that experiment they are labelled 13392, 13393 & 13394\. They will be sampled
when counting experiment 828.

  1. Transferred 9 x vessels to BSC (excluding cultures 13380-13382, as these will have already been sampled during the counting of experiment 828)
  2. Took 1 x 50 uL sample from each flask 
  3. Pipetted each sample into 1 x well of Cellaca counting plate
  4. Replaced cultures in incubators 
  5. Prepared Cellaca counting plate and ran count
