  1. Placed 12 mL of growth media in the water bath at 37C 13:15  
  

  2. Culture vessels removed from the incubator 13:20  
  

  3. Each vessel was examined under the microscope and imaged at 10x magnifications. Observations were recorded in the table bellow    
  

  4. Removed 100% of the media from the vessel and transferred to an empty well within the same plate (Moved from well A1 to A2)
