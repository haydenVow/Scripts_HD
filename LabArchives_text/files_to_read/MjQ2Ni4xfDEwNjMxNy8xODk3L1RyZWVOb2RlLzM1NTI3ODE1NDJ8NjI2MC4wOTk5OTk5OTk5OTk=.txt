Process:

  1. Aliquotted  1 x 30 mL of  growth Media into  1 x 50 mL    falcon tubes(s). 
  2. Retrieved aliquot and added 7.5 uL of P38i to each falcon tube
  3. Placed medium aliquot in water bath    8:45     

  4. Stopped the shaker and removed cultures from the incubator before restarting the shaker   9:45     

  5. Placed suspension flask(s) inside the BSC and allowed to sit static for 3-5 minutes to allow microcarriers to settle to the base of the flask. 
  6. Carefully removed  50  % of supernatant from the flask(s) by pipetting slowly and following the meniscus with the pipette tip so as to avoid placing the pipette tip near the microcarriers at the base of the flask(s). 
  7. Replaced with  15 mL (per well/per vessel) of   growth  media. 
  8. Returned vessel to incubate at:   10:00   , incubator #  68

  * [ x]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (aviary cells)
