### Cell Harvest

  1. Turn on water bath and set temperature to 37C.
  2. Take the flasks for harvest and observe under the microscope at 4x objective for even cell distribution . Refer to VSOP-006. Take 2-3 images per flask.
  3. Aliquot required volume of dPBS (37C), dPBS (ambient temp) and TrypLE in separate sterile pots.  Refer to Table above for required volume.
  4. Place aliquots in pre-warmed water bath and leave for ~20 minutes or until warmed. Note: Ensure TrypLE is thoroughly warmed.  
`    Time stamp` : 11:15am  

  5. Transfer aliquots and flasks required for harvest into the BSC.
  6. Discard growth media from each flask.
  7. Wash with warmed dPBS, then discard.
  8. Add TrypLE to each of the flasks. Mix thoroughly to ensure coverage of the surface area.
  9. Place in the incubator at 37C. After 10 minutes, remove flasks and observe for 95-100% dissociation of cells. Incubate further until maximum dissociation level is reached.  
     NOTE: The flasks must be removed from the incubator within 15 minutes of initial incubation of TrypLE containing flasks.

  10. Aspirate the TrypLE solution and collect into 50mL centrifuge tubes(labelled).
  11. Using a serological pipette, dispense ambient temperature dPBS to create a final wash for each of the flasks. To effectively remove remaining cells adhered to the gelatin coated flasks,  aspirate the dPBS and resuspend into the the flask 2-3 times before collecting and combining the entire volume into the centrifuge tubes.
  12. Centrifuge at 700 x g for 5 minutes. ``

  13. Gently remove centrifuge tubes from the machine, ensuring not to disturb the suspended pellets. Aspirate the supernatant from the tubes. Discard supernatant. Use Growth media to neutralise TrypLE and combine the cell pellet of the same treatment groups into a pre-weight tube as below.

### Re-pellet and Weigh Final Yield

  1.  Label and Record the weight of 1 sterile centrifuge tube and set aside. Record details in Table.  
  2.  Transfer resuspension media into the new centrifuge tubes.
  3. Centrifuge at 700 x g x 5 minutes. 
  4. Aspirate the supernatant from the tubes. Remove as much remaining supernatant with a 1mL pipette.
  5. Record the final weight of the cell pellet. Enter details in Table. 
  6. Immediately provide to the food team for testing.

Observations from 24-hr treatment

20% FBS + TGF + VitC: most cells have formed aggregates, no cells adhered to
surface on 1xT175, and very little adhered to surface on the other 2 (looks
like they will clump and lift off)  
10% FBS + TGF + Vit C: a combination of aggregates and sheet, some cells have  
10% FBS + TGF: no aggregates. cells still adhered to surface  
10% FBS + VitC: no aggregates. Cells still adhered to surface (edited)  

For harvesting, the majority of cells for TGF+Vit C treated (10% or 20% FBS)
were present in the aggregates. Very little cells were collected from TrypLE
of the 20% FBS flasks, and there were some sheet like fragments present in the
TrypLE of the 10% FBS.

TrypLE-ing of Vit C treated flasks came off as a 'sheet'. TGF treated flasks
were harvested regularly without any spectacular difference to normal.

Weighed pellets appeared to be relatively the same between all treatments
except TGF only which was about 55-65% of the other cell pellets. 20% FBS +
TGF + VitC resulted in the heaviest pellet.
