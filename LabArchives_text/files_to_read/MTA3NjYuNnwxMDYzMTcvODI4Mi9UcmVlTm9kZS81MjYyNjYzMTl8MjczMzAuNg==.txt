Procedure


PREPARE DESTINATION VESSELS

  1. Filled all wells on 19x 96 well plates with 200uL of  DMEM/F12 (1:1) + 20% FBS +1xP/S
  2. Plates were placed in the incubator (140) at 30 degrees, 5% CO2 to warm. 

  







PASSAGING OF NUCLEOFECTED CELLS

  1.  Took 2 x images of each vessel with microscope on phase setting (4X to assess confluence) 
  2. removed the T75 cultures from the incubator then aspirated and discarded the media from each. 
  3. Added 5mL of room temp dPBS to wash each flask. 
  4. Aspirated and discarded the washes, replacing with 5mL of 1xTryple-EDTA 
  5. Placed flasks to incubate at 30 degrees for 13 minutes, 5% CO2 (incubator 140). 
  6. Once cells were confirmed detached by inspection under the microscope (4x Objective), 5mL of dPBS was added to each flask to neutralise the Tryple-EDTA.
  7. The contents of each flask were collected into separate 15mL tubes.
  8. Tubes were spun at 500g for 5 minutes. 
  9. Supernatant from all tubes were discarded and the cell pellets were resupsended in 1.4mL of cold FACS buffer prepared 10 days earlier (phenol red free 1:1 DMEM/F12 + 2% FBS) 
  10. 1mL of each cell suspension transferred to separate filter cap tubes, 1 drop (approximately 20uL) of 7-AAD was then added to each tube and tubes were left to incubate for 5 minutes at room temperature. 
    1. Cells were then moved to the MELODY FACS sorter for sorting. 
    2. Flow rate was set to 10. 10,000 events were recorded for each cell type as they were being sorted. 
    3. Sorted samples into 5x96 well plates (4x96wp for control), 1 single cell per well. 
    4. Plates were placed in the incubator 140, 30 degres, 5% CO2. Average plate sort time was 6-7 minutes. Total sorting time was approximately 2.5 hours. 
  11. 400uL of the remaining cell suspension was transferred to separate 1.5mL tubes and centrifuged for 5 minutes at 500g.
    1. Media was aspirated and discarded from each cell pellet.
    2. Cells were then washed in 500uL of dPBS. 
    3. Cells were centrifuged at 500g once more for 5 minutes room temp.
    4. Supernatant was aspirated and discarded leaving a dry cell pellet. 
    5. Tubes containing cell pellets were placed in a yellow top 70mL container labelled with the date, EPIC ID and initials before being placed at -20 degrees in the library lab freezer (62) bottom shelf.

## Observations

\- Decided not to freeze any of the cells due to time constraints. Cell
viability was high even after 2 hours at room temperature once 7-AAD had been
added.

Control cells were sorted last.
