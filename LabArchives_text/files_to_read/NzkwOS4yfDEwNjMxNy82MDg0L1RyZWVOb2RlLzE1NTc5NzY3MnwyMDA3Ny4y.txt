Process:

  1.  1000 mL  media in water bath 37degC
  2. Aliquotted   500 mL  mL of HyCell CHO medium directly into each new E2000 flask (100 mL per flask) at room temperature      
  3. Removed E500 flasks from incubator
  4. Mixed culture by vigorous manual swirling
  5. Took 500 uL sample from each, returned flasks to incubator, and performed cell counts:
    1. Count culture 9700 & 9701: 2.16x10^9
    2. Total count:2.16x10^9  

  6. Removed E500 flasks from incubator 15:18
  7. Combined both cultures in a single flask, then transferred 200 mL of culture to each of the E2000 flasks
  8. Transferred E2000 vessels to incubate at 100 RPM:

  * [X]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (aviary cells)

  

  * Incubator (# New Eppendorf shaking incubator  ), Lab [Main/Library/Production]
