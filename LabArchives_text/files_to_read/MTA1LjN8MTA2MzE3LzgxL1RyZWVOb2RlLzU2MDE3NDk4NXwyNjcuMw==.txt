RELATED TO MILESTONE:  Establish a WCB for fibroblasts

AIM/PURPOSE: The aim of this project is to generate a DOLLY fibroblast WCB for
use in future experiments.

HYPOTHESIS: That will need a steady supply of DOLLY fibroblasts for co-culture
experiments, and we can generate them from DOLLY fibroblast MCB.

RESULTS SUMMARY: See report.

CONCLUSIONS: Fibroblasts can be continuously passaged long enough to create a
WCB.

NEXT STEPS: DOLLY12 fibroblast WCB ready to be used by the co-culture team
