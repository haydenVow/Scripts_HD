### Process:

1\. Took image of vessel with microscope on phase setting.

3\. Aliquotted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then
placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath for a minimum of 20 minutes
prior to use:

  1. TrypLE:    10     mL in      1   tubes
  2.  dPBS (for neutralising):     10    mL
  3.  dPBS (for washing):      5 x 0.5mL (CHOMP) + 1 x 2mL (KUZCO20)  

  4. Growth media (for pellet resuspension):     1 (KUZCO20)    mL
  5. Growth media (for seeding):    12mL (KUZCO20)+ 6mL (CHOMP)     mL 

Time that all aliquots were placed in the water bath the warm before use
15:02 pm

Note: if aliquots were placed in water bath at different time, record the time
stamp for each individual solution.

  

Transferred 1mL/well into 2 x 24-well plates (5 wells each A1-A5).

Split the crocodile pieces from A1 (6-well plate) into both A1 wells in the
24-well plates.  
Continue for crocodile pieces from A2 (6-well plate) into both A2 wells in the
24-well plates.

Continue for wells A3, B1 and B3 (6-well plates) into the 24-well plate wells
A3, A4 and A5 respectively




4\. Removed vessel(s) from the incubator    15:15 pm

5\. Washed the vessel(s) with dPBS (warmed).

6\. Added      2   mL tryple to each vessel/well and incubated at 37˚C.

  1. Start/Finish for TrypLE was    15:37 -  15:51 pm 

7\. Neutralised with    2mL each    dPBS and combined cell suspension into a
15mL     tubes.

8\. Centrifuged at 650 x g for 5 min.

  1. Start/Finish time for centrifugation was  15:59  \- 16:04 pm 




9\. Aspirated the supernatant(s).

10\. Resuspended pellet(s) in         mL          media     :   a/pm

11\. Aliquoted          of resuspended cells into a microcentrifuge tube for
cell count.

12\. Performed a cell count using the haemocytometer and recorded the cell
count data in the Google Doc spreadsheet: Cell Count Spreadsheet or cell count
widget below

  1. Total cell number was:           
  2. Volume of cell suspension required for subculture was:           
  3. Cell density per vessel:          




13\. Transferred      all KUZCO18     µl of cell suspension to the pre-warmed
5   mL Growth media:      16:20 pm

14\. Transferred cell suspension into the     T25     vessel.

16\. Transferred vessel(s) to incubate at: 16:24

  * [ ]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (avian cells)
