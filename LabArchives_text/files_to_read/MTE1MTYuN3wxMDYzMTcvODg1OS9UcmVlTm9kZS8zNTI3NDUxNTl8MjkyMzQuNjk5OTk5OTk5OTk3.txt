Process:

  1. Need 374.4mL of basal media for both initial seeding (300uL per well) and also MMC media change (1ml) per well. Making up 600mL total in case any mishaps happen.
  2. Made up 600mL of Basal Media using the Mix Components outlined in Ranger (when you look up the Mix ID)
  3. Sterile filtered media using 1L filter unit
  4. Aliquotted 88mL of basal media for seeding event (6 x 48 well plates)
  5. Placed aliquot in water bath at 11:25am.
  6. Dissolved 90g of Ficoll 70 in 140mL of Basal Media to achieve a concentration of 650mg/ml (saturation limit as determined by testing the previous day)
  7. Aliquotted 12.45mL of Culture 12736 1/2 flask (had a density of 4,815,333 cells/ml) to get 60 million cells in 88mL of media
  8. Seeded out 5 replicate Corning 48 well plates at 300uL of cell suspension per well and a sixth plate to test out higher concentrations of each crowder individually. (2:23pm)
  9. Placed all plates in top left window facing Binder incubator (37C, 5% CO2) at 2:27pm

Observations/Summary:

  * Didnt have enough Ficoll 400 and also it burned on the hotplate while stirring releasing the solution onto the bench.
  * It was decided that Carrageenan would substitute F400 in this DSD.
  * In future, the hotplate will be used with caution and double checked before leaving without supervision. Moreover, the availability of Ficoll seems to be a new issue - this will be monitored from here on out.
