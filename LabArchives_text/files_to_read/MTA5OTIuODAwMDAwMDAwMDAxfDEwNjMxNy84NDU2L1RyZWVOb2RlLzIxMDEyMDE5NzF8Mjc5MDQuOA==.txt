Aim


To further explore potential biomaterial candidates and determine the effect
of the addition of gluten


Hypothesis


Due to the different properties required in the final scaffold, more than one
biomaterial will be needed to create the final bioink.


Method


1\. Weigh out all biomaterial powders and combine together.

2.Hydrate various biomaterials in PBS with 0.0025%w/w of Epsilon Poly L Lysine
(concentration under investigation). Stir with a spatula until mostly
dissolved.

** Note: Epsilon limit of 0.01-0.02 w/w% use at 0.0025%w/w (0.005% of a 50%
powder) (12mg in 240mL)

3\. Refrigerate overnight at 4C.

4\. Stir to ensure a homogenous biogel.

5\. Autoclave for 20 mins at 121C.

6\. Cast in moulds/extrude and set.

6A. Determine resolution of print, idea of viscosity, shear thinning

6B. Determine solubility in water.

Observations

Hydrating materials - Combining all the powders together prior to the addition
into the PBS worked well and assisted in the dissolution of the components,
especially methylcellulose. Presence of EPL as expected, did not affect
dissolution of the components.

Hydration overnight - Any remaining biomaterials became fully hydrated
overnight to create an homogenous even consistency gel.

Dispensing - Little pressure was required to dispense through a 10 mL syringe
without needle

Stability in water - Not tested.
