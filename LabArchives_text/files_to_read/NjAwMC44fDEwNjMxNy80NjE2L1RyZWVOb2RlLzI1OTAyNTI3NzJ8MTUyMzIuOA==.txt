Note: In well A1 of both WALLE02 and WALLE04 there are areas of the well that
are 80-100% confluent. In other areas, there are very few cells. It was
decided to passage these wells today to distribute the cells more evenly. Some
adherent cells have begun to appear in other wells of these cultures as well.
These wells were created as spent media was retained in additional wells when
performing 50% feeds to avoid losing cells (prior to attachment).

### Process:  

3\. Aliquoted the required volume of each reagent in the table above and then
placed all aliquots to warm in the water bath for a minimum of 20 minutes
prior to use:

  1. TrypLE:     4  mL in     1 x   tube
  2.  dPBS (for washing and neutralising):    4   mL 
  3. dPBS (for neutralising):    4 mL
  4. Growth media (for pellet resuspension +seeding):    15 mL 

Time that all aliquots were placed in the water bath the warm before use
12:15  

Note: if aliquots were placed in water bath at different time, record the time
stamp for each individual solution.




4\. Removed vessel(s) from the incubator

5\. Washed the vessel(s) with dPBS (warmed).12:30

6\. Added    2   mL tryple to each vessel/well and incubated at 37ËšC.

  1. Start/Finish for TrypLE was   12:40-13:10  

7\. Neutralised with    2mL   dPBS and combined cell suspension.

8\. Centrifuged at 650 x g for 5 min.

  1. Start/Finish time for centrifugation was     




9\. Aspirated the supernatant(s).

10\. Resuspended each pellet(s) in    1  mL       growth   media

11\. Aliquoted   10ul     of resuspended cells into a microcentrifuge tube for
cell count.

12\. Performed a cell count using the haemocytometer and recorded the cell
count data in the Google Doc spreadsheet called 'Cell Count Spreadsheet' (see
link below):

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1DPzKubYxfHmWogVPihC-
SSIBtIylyrBQE5kRX5Z8NtI/edit#gid=0

  1. Total cell number was:  WALLE02: 48,000  
WALLE04:12,000  

13\. Added cell suspension into  of growth media. - Note- cells were seeded in
1mL growth media rather that the recommended 500uL for 24 well plates in order
to avoid needing to re-centrifuge WALLE04.  
WALLE02: 4mL  
WALLE04: Left in 1mL media  

14\. Seeded into  
WALLE02: 4 x wells of a 24 well plate (1mL/well) 6315/cm  
WALLE04: 1 x wells of a 24 well plate (entire 1mL volume) 6315/cm  

15\. Placed in incubator at Library #68 13:45

### Observations/Summary:  
Im not sure how reliable these counts are given the low number of cells
harvested  

  




### Results

  * Results were;
    * [x]  As Usual (this is a repetitive task)
    * [ ]  Unexpected because...
    * [ ]  Need to be further analysed
    * [ ]  Other (.......)
