Main Lab incubator 81  
Main lab, "Media & Gelatin" fridge, crisper drawer, black test tube rack  
4 x 50 mL tubes. 1 contains 5 aliquots of 1.5 mL - this is for 6-well plate.
The three remaining wells of the 2 x 6WPs are fed using the large aliquots,
which have enough media to also feed the E-flasks (they are replicates of the
E-flasks)

Process:

Collected all aliquots listed in "Feed Information" table and placed in water
bath  : a/pm  

Note: Originally this was meant to be a 50% feed for all cultures. Given we
did not have enough of GM+HDAC1 or GM+HDAC2 media to do this, please just
replace 10 mL of each E-flask with fresh medium, and then do a regular 50%
feed for all the wells of the 6WP. The serum-control aliquot does have enough
for a full 50% feed of both the E-flask and the 6WP, however for consistency
please also just do a 10 mL feed for the serum-control E-flask. Thank you!!

  
E-125 flasks

  1. Collected E125s from shaker, wiped with ethanol-sprayed Rediwipe, and brought into BSC 16:30
  2. Using a 25 mL serelogical pipette, gently pipette-mixed culture for 1 minute to break up cell clumps
  3. Pipette suspension though 70 um cell strainer into 3 x 50 mL tubes. Kept E125 vessels in BSC, as culture will be returned to this vessel after feed. 
  4. Centrifuged 50 mL tubes at 300 x g for 5 min.   16:37 - 16:42 
  5. Aspirated ~~  ~~50 % ( 15 mL)~~~~ 1/3 (10 mL)  ~~~~of supernatant, taking extra care to not disrupt or aspirate pellet
  6. Added 10 mL of fresh, warmed growth medium.
  7. Re-suspended pellet by gently pipette-mixed culture using serelogical, before moving cell suspension back to E125
  8. Returned E125s to incubator.   16:50

6-Well-Plates

  1. Collected 6-well-plates from shaker, wiped with ethanol-sprayed Rediwipe, and brought into BSC
  2. Using a 5 mL serelogial, transferred each cell suspension into 6 x 15 mL tubes. Kept 6-well-plates in BSC, as culture will be returned to this vessel after feed. 
  3. Centrifuged 15 mL tubes at 300 x g for 5 min.   16:00 - 16:05 
  4. Aspirated   50 % ( 1.5 mL) of supernatant, taking extra care to not disrupt or aspirate pellet 
  5. Added 1.5 mL of fresh, warmed growth medium.
  6. Re-suspended pellet by gently pipette-mixed culture using 5 mL serelogical or P1000, before moving cell suspension back to 6-well-plate
  7. Returned 6-well-plates to incubator.   16:27
