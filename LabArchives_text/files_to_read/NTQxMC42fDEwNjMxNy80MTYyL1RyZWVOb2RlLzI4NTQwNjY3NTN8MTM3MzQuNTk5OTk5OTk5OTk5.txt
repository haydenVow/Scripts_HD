Aliquot 6mL of dPBS into 2 x tubes (6mL each). Warmed in 37C water bath. 14:10
pm

Add 120uL of 5mM p53i to 1 of the tubes.

Add 120uL of DMSO to the other tube.

Remove growth media from wells, add 500uL/well of 100mM p53i/dPBS solution to
3 wells on each plate.

Add 500uL/well of DMSO/dPBS solution to 3 wells on each plate.

  

  

  




  1. Remove the growth media and wash all plates with 5mL dPBS. Split the plates into 4 groups (G1-G4)

  2. Add 10mL of fresh dPBS with/without 100uM of p53 inhibitor (Pifithrin-Î±, p-nitro, cyclic) to each plate (see table below for which plates require p53 inhibitor) PLEASE SEE THIS DOCUMENT PRIOR TO HANDLING P53 INHIBITOR

  3. Inside the BSC, Wrap plates 2of2 from each cell line in foil and leave in the BSC. 

  4. Set up the reptile solar lamp inside the BSC at a distance that is 30cm from the plate surface, using the UV meter, detect the UV intensity emitted by the lamp and record it (mW/cm^2). Perform a calculation to determine the length of time required to generate a 600,000 J/m^2 UV energy dose using the following formulas.  
  
mW/cm2 x seconds = mj/cm2

0.1 mJ/ cm2 = 1 J/m2

  5.  4mW/cm2 x 7200 (2h) = 3600 mj/cm2 = 288,000J/m2

Start time: 14:44 pm

Finish time: 16:44 pm

  




  1. Prepared 2 x 3mL of DMEM/F12 + 10% FBS + 1X P/S (for F_NANDO3 cells)
    1. Added 60uL of p53i to 1 x aliquot
    2. Added 60uL of sterile filtered DMSO to 1 x aliquot
  2. Prepared 2 x 3mL of DMEM/F12 + 20% FBS + 1X P/S (for F_DOLLY12_3P23 cells)
    1. Added 60uL of p53i to 1 x aliquot
    2. Added 60uL of sterile filtered DMSO to 1 x aliquot
  3. Warmed at 37C until UV is turned off.
  4. Replaced media on all wells (with and without p53i respectively to what they were incubated in) = 500uL/well




DMEM/F12 + 20% FBS + 1X P/S = Mix #6859

DMEM/F12 + 10% FBS + 1X P/S = Mix #6779
