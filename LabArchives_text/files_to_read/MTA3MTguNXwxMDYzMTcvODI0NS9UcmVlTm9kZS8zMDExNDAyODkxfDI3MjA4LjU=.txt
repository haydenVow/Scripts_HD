Perform bank using below volumes

  




Observation of DUCK EYE cultures prior to bank.

DUCKEYE cultures were all 100% confluent with varied morphologies of
fibroblastic cells and cells forming circular clusters reminiscent of
embryonic stem cells.




Process

 1\. Aliquoted reagents and placed in the cell culture incubator to warm for a
minimum of 30 minutes prior to use:

  1. T75 flask were pre-filled with 12mL of growth media per flask and placed in the incubator to warm and to equilibrate. 2x flasks were filled for each of the 3 media types. 
  2. TrypLE:  20mL 
  3. dPBS (for washing and neutralising)   50mL 
  4. Media (for pellet resuspension):  10mL 
  5. Discarded spent media
  6. Washed each flask with 10mL PBS
  7. Added 10mL of Tryple to each flask and incubated for 10min
  8. Added 10mL PBS to each flask to neutralise
  9. Transferred cell suspensions to 50mL falcon tubes
  10. Centrifuged at 500g for 5min




Process post centrifugation.

  1.  Aspirated the supernatant(s). 
  2. Resuspend pellet(s) in |10ml (JUMBOO) or 5mL (JUMBOK and JUMBOF)respective growth medias| 
  3. Performed a cell count using the haemocytometer and recorded the cell count data in the Google Doc spreadsheet called 'Cell Count Spreadsheet' https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1DPzKubYxfHmWogVPihC-SSIBtIylyrBQE5kRX5Z8NtI/edit#gid=0  
Total cell number was: | 1.95M (JUMBOK), 63.9M (JUMBOO), 4.5M (JUMBOF)|

  4. 1M cells were taken from JUMBOK and JUMBOF cell suspension and seeded into 1 x pre-filled T75 flask each. 2M cells were taken form JUMBOO and seeded into 2x T75 flasks (13.33M cells/cm)
  5. The remaining cells were centrifuged at approx. 500g for 5min.
  6. Supernatant removed and cell pellets resuspended in chilled Cryostor CS10 transferred into cyrovials as follows  
JUMBOO 12.4mL (5M cells/mL) - In 12vials  
JUMBOK 1mL (1M cells/mL)- In 1 vial  
JUMBOF  3mL (1M cells/mL) - In 3 vials

  7. Transfered the cryovials to a Mr. Frosty immediately into the -80ÂºC freezer.

    * [ x]  1st Freeze
    * []  2nd Freeze
    * [ ]  3rd Freeze
    * [ ]  4th Freeze
    * [ ]  5th Freeze
  8. Allowed the cells to freeze for at least 18-24 hours before transferring to Liquid Nitrogen storage.
