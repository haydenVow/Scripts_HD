Preparation


Equilibrate microcarriers in culture medium before use

  1. Prior to use, aliquotted two lots of | 27.78 | mL of sterilized microcarriers ( 20 g/L stock) suspended in dPBS into |  1 |  x | E500  | flasks.
  2. Rinsed microcarriers in | 30 | mL culture medium (50 mL/g Cytodex). (this rinse reduces dilution of the culture medium by PBS trapped between and within the microcarriers, which is particularly important when using small culture volumes or cells with low plating efficiencies).
  3. The microcarriers were then allowed to settle and as much supernatant as possible was removed.
  4. The microcarriers were resuspended to the desired volume of culture medium ( | 120 | mL ) in each vessel.
  5. The culture vessel was transferred to the incubator for at least 1 hour or overnight so that the microcarriers and culture medium could equilibrate. |   12:00   am/pm | 
    * 37 degrees, 5% CO2, Incubator #  |  67 |  

  




## Gelatin coat 3 x Diff plates:

1\. Gelatin coated 6x96wp, wells B2-B4, C2-C4 placed in incubator at 37
degrees 5% CO2. 0.1% gelatin solution used. | 11:05 10/06/21 |

2\. Wrapped in parafilm and stored in fridge until use.  
  







Growth Media:

  * [x]  DMEM/F12 + 20% FBS + 1X P/S + P38i (10uM)
  * [ ]  DMEM/F12 + 20% FBS + 1X P/S + 25ng/mL FGF-basic + P38i (10uM)

  




### Prepared materials:

  * For 1 flask in each of the 2xE125 flask set 
    * Trypsin-EDTA containing poloxomer 188 (1% w/v) will be used for the harvest. 
    * Growth media containing 1% w/v poloxomer 188 will be used to neutralise the trypsin. 
    * dPBS containing poloxomer 188 (10% w/v) will be used to wash carriers after neutralised cells are collected.   

1\. Aliquotted the required volume of each reagent and then placed all
aliquots to warm in the water bath for a minimum of 20 minutes prior to use:

  1. dPBS (for washing before Trypsinization), 100 mL per g Cytodex 1:     30   mL in     1x50mL   tubes, moved from freezer to waterbath    13:15

Passage


## First wash to remove serum:

  1. Allow the microcarriers to settle for at least 2 minutes [14:00]
  2. Gently tilt the flask to an angle of approximately 30 degrees from vertical
  3. Remove the cap and aspirate the supernatant using a serological pipet - keep the tip only 5-10 mm below the surface during this procedure
  4. Transfer half of the fresh, pre-warmed dPBS (15mL) for prewashing to the flask using a serological pipet - wash down the insides to wash any stuck microcarriers back into the bulk suspension, then replace the cap

  







## Second wash to remove serum:

  1. Allow the microcarriers to settle for at least 2 minutes 14:08
  2. Gently tilt the flask to an angle of approximately 30 degrees from vertical
  3. Remove the cap and aspirate the supernatant using a serological pipet - keep the tip only 5-10 mm below the surface during this procedure
  4. Transfer the remaining half of the fresh, pre-warmed dPBS for prewashing to the flask using a serological pipet - wash down the insides to wash any stuck microcarriers back into the bulk suspension, then replace the cap

  




## Add detachment agent:

  1. Allow the microcarriers to settle for at least 2 minutes
  2. Gently tilt the flask to an angle of approximately 30 degrees from vertical
  3. Remove the cap and aspirate the supernatant using a serological pipet - keep the tip only 5-10 mm below the surface during this procedure
  4. Transfer the fresh, pre-warmed Trypsin/EDTA/Poloxomer 188 solution to the flask using a serological pipet - wash down the insides to wash any stuck microcarriers back into the bulk suspension, then replace the cap.

  




## Incubate flask:

  1. Stop the shaker
  2. Remove the flask from the BSC and transfer it back to the shaker
  3. Restart the shaker at the `speed 110rpm` \- see the table below. [14:24]
  4. After `7 `minutes, stop the shaker
  5. Remove the flask from the shaker [14:32]
  6. Cells were sampled (100uL) at the 10 minute mark, some free floating cells were observed as a result of detachment under 4X objective (Primo) however a large amount of cells appeared to be still attached. Hence, it was decided to leave cells in shaker for an additional 7 mins. [14:38]
  7. At 14:46 , flasks were sampled once again to observed detachment, cells still appeared to be attached and not free floating single cells as desired. Hence, cells were placed back in the incubator for another 10 mins.
  8. At 15:00 , flasks were sampled once again to observed detachment, cells still appeared to be attached and not free floating single cells as desired. Hence, cells were placed back in the incubator for another 5 mins.
  9. Realised the wrong shake speed was being used. Turned shake speed up to 155 rpm.
  10. At 15:14 , flasks were sampled once again to observed detachment, cells still appeared to be attached and not free floating single cells as desired. Hence, cells were placed back in the incubator for another 5 mins. RPM turned up to 210.  
  

  11. The flask was removed from shaker at 15:34
  12. Wipe down the flask with an ethanol-soaked wipe and place it in the BSC

  5. Removed the cap and transferred the supernatant from each flask to centrifuge tubes using a serological pipet. For each flask set, poloxomer 188 treated supernatant was kept separate from non poloxomer treated supernatant.

  




## Recover Cells

Used Taipan V1 to remove the cell suspension into two 50 mL tubes.




## First wash to recover additional cells:

  1. Transfer half of the fresh, pre-warmed dPBS solution to the flask using a serological pipet - wash down the insides to wash any stuck microcarriers back into the bulk suspension

  3. Pipet-mixed the suspension vigorously
  4. Allow the microcarriers to settle for at least 2 minutes
  5. Gently tilt the flask to an angle of approximately 30 degrees from vertical
  6. Removed the cap and transferred the supernatant from each flask to centrifuge tubes using a serological pipet. For each flask set, poloxomer 188 treated supernatant was kept separate from non poloxomer treated supernatant

  




## Second wash to recover additional cells:

  1. Repeated the first wash procedure (steps 1-6 above) once more with fresh dPBS with/without poloxomer.
  2. 10mL of fresh dPBS was added to each harvested E flask to resuspend microcarriers. 

  




#  ~~ ~~Optional: sieve cell suspension to remove microcarriers~~~~

  1.  ~~ ~~Pass the cell suspension through a 40 - 100 um pore-size sieve to remove any errant microcarriers.~~~~




## Recover pellet, prepare suspension for counting and subculture:

  1. Centrifuged all supernatant tubes at 650 - 700 RCF for 5 minutes. 16:20

Observations/Summary:

The E125 flask media appeared to have strands and cloudy parts in it which
didn't look like microcarriers. This was sampled but has not yet been
analysed.

  

The trypsin aliquots appeared to have different colours, with variations of
yellow and pink, which looked separated frozen. Only one aliquot was used and
picked at random.

  

The trysinisation took much longer than expected.

The RPM used for trypsinisation was much lower for roughly the first 30 min.
110 RPM compared to 155 RPM. This was due to human error. The RPM was
increased to 210 for roughly the second hour. The cells were still not
observed to be completely off the carriers at this stage but the trypsin was
neutalized due to the long amount of exposure time.

  
The Taipan tool was also not used for collecting the PBS wash, only the
neutralising media and trypsin. This was due to the tool being contaminated
before doing the PBS wash. So the PBS wash surfactant was only collected with
a pipette.

  
These reasons may be responsible for the lower than expected cell count. For
this reason, the cells were passaged into a E250 instead of a E500.

  
Many cells were still present in the after-harvest imaging, on the carriers
and in suspension.
