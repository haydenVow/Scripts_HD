Performed By: LL TA  




Protocol:

  1. Removed the culture plate 7944 with the hanging drops from the incubator.
  2. Reviewed each droplet under the microscope and recorded observations.
  3. Made up staining buffer:
    1. 1 mL filtered dPBS
    2. 2 drops Hoechst
    3. 1 drop Sytox Green
  4. Added 10 uL of staining buffer directly to 3 x droplets and let incubate in the dark at RT for 20 minutes 15:02 - 15:23
  5. While droplets were incubating, aspirated 20 uL of droplet (from multiple droplets on the same well plate) 
  6. Added 20 uL of Trypan blue and loaded onto Haemocytometer 
  7. Imaged trypan-stained cells
  8. Imaged hoechst/sytox green stained droplet on Zaber
  9. Discarded culture plate 7944 (5 plates remaining in Thermo incubator) 




Observations & Images:

MIA Link https://mia-capture.vow.tools/#/session/reccZFoVnUNttnziS/images

1) Observation of droplets under microscope showed cells have clumped together

2) Trypan-stained culture under haemocytometer showed clumped cells, dead
cells and debris

3) Hoechst & Sytox stain had positive DAPI channel signals but minimal
positive 488 channel signals
