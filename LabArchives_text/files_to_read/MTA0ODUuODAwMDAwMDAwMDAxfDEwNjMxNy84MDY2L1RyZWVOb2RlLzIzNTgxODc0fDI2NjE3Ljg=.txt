Method:

  1. Removed culture 12079 from the incubator and proceeded with passage of adherent cells in wells 1 and 2. 
    1. Removed and discarded supernatant from the cells 
    2. Added 1mL of dPBS to wash the cells, discarded the wash.
    3. Added 1mL of Tryple-EDTA to the cells and let them incubate for 10 minutes at 30 degrees, 5% CO2. 
    4. Added 1mL of dPBS to neutralise the Tryple then combined both wells into a 15mL tube.
    5. Took 20uL of the cell suspension for a cell count, mixing 1:1 with Trypan blue and loading onto a hemocytometer. (see count details below).

    7. Split the cell suspension into two 15mL tubes, 
      1. one labelled 'adherent'  
      2. one labelled 'adherent - no PI'  
  2. Removed cultures from the incubator. 11491-2 ctrl r9, 11488-1 CDKN1A+ZIC, 11485-2 cdkn1b 
  3. Removed 500,000 cells from each of the cultures above and placed in a 15mL tubes. 
    1. Ctrl R9 - 0.753mL
    2. CDKN1B+ZIC1 - 1.437mL
    3. CDKN1B - 1.623mL
  4. Proceeded with the Fixing and PI staining protocol above as instructed using all 5 samples in 15mL tubes. 
    1. For the 'adherent - no PI' tube the cells were resuspended in 1mL of MilliQ water without PI at the final step prior to Flow cytometry. 
  5. Once samples were loaded in the MELODY machine, single cells were gated and PI intensity was assessed alongside event count. See images below.

Overall we weren't able to see any cells obviously in S or G2 phase in any of
the suspension samples. We could see more of a distinct G1/G0, S phase and G2
phase histogram when examining the adherent cell population. We also found our
negative control did not show any PI signal which was expected. Histograms of
the single cell cell populations for each suspension sample exhibited one wide
peak. Similar to the results of cells in the Round 8 samples, this suggests
that most cells are in G0/G1 phase, confirming there is no clear indication
that the cells are proliferating.
