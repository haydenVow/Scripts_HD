  2. Place the already aliquoted media into the water bath (30ºC, for reptilian cells) 16:15
  3. Remove flasks from the incubator. 16:21
  4. Removed  50 % of supernatant (6 mL) from each vessel. 
    * Note: please use separate serologicals when aspirating supernatant for each flask as they are different types of CHOMP cells
  5. Replaced with  6 mL per vessel of  growth medium. 
    * Note: please use separate serologicals when transfering the medium into each flask as they are different types of CHOMP cells)
  6. Returned vessel to incubate at: 16:37
