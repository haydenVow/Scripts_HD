Observations/conclusion:  
  
In the first oven calibration test at 220'C the max temperature reached was
130'C. Whereas, in the second test under the same conditions the max
temperature reached was 225'C.  
  
The vast difference in temperatures attained during these two tests
demonstrates that this dry-heat oven is not reliable enough for our purposes.
Wherein, the difference in sterilisation temperature would introduce high
variability into our scaffold preparation process. For this reason we will
look into the purchase of a more accurate drying oven.
