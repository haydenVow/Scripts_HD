  1. Added sterile zein to a 24WP with HTS inserts
  2. Left in hood to partially dry until ready to seed 12:00 - 3:30 
  3. Received cells from cell expansion team. 5 million cells were available, so decided to seed 6 scaffolds at ~0.8M cells per scaffold. 
  4. Centrifuged tube for 5 min at 650g 
  5. Resuspended in 300 uL of warmed D/F+20%FBS+1xP/S+P38i
  6. Added 50 uL of cell suspension to 6 x zein scaffold pieces. Left to sit in BSC for 30 minutes.
  7. Added 1950 uL of warmed D/F+20%FBS+1xP/S+P38i to each seeded zein scaffold and 2000 uL to 6 x cell free zein scaffolds 
  8. Placed in incubator.
