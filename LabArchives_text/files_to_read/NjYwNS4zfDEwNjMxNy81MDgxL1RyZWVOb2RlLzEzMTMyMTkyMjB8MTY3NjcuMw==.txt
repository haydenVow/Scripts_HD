1\. Aliquotted  300 mL  mL of  E6 Media into  300 mL     container. Placed in
water bath   11:10 a/pm




T175 Process

2\. Removed   100% of supernatant from vessel.

3\. Replaced with  300 mL (per well/per vessel) of   E6  media.

4\. Returned vessel to incubate at: 11:33

  * [x ]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (aviary cells)

  

  * [ ]  Thermo Incubator (ID #13)

Cell factory Process

  1. Unscrew white cap and remove blue cap and place aside.
  2. Removed  `100` % of supernatant (300 mL) from 1 x 2CF by carefully pouring all the waste media out. 
  3. Replaced with  `300` mL (per flask) of  `growth`   media by carefully pouring media through the white cap opening (alternatively you may use a 50mL serological to add media.)
  4. Place caps back and equalise 2CF by placing it on its side (blue cap on the bottom and white cap on the top, see image below:)  
  

4\. Returned vessel to incubate at:

  * [x]  37ºC, 5% CO2 (mammalian cells)
  * [ ]  40ºC, 5% CO2 (aviary cells)

  

  * [x]  Contherm 118
