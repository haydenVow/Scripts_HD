AIM/PURPOSE: Expand F_CHOMP07 MCB cells to a WCB of  ≥ 400M cells.

HYPOTHESIS: Continued culture of an initial population of 1.5M F_CHOMP07 MCB
cells will allow for a bank of  ≥ 400M cells within 4 passages.

AIM/PURPOSE: Expand F_CHOMP07 MCB cells to a WCB of  ≥ 400M cells.

HYPOTHESIS:  Continued culture of an initial population of 1.5M F_CHOMP09 MCB
cells will allow for a bank of  ≥ 400M cells within 4 passages.

RESULTS SUMMARY:  The hypothesis was supported, a WCB of 950M cells was
generated from a starting population of 1.38M cells, over 4 passages. This
took the form of 70x 10M vials and 50x 5M vials. The average cell doubling
time over the course of the expansion was 2.68 days.

CONCLUSIONS:  A WCB of 950M F_CHOMP07 cells was banked.

NEXT STEPS: The F_CHOMP07 WCB is now also available for use, and a F_CHOMP09
WCB is due to be banked over the next week. These cells will be available for
use by both Production and Science teams. If these stocks are exhausted, we
may need to generate additional WCBs from our MCB stocks.
